0	the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits  the rationale is sound  but in many cases of this and recent years  the sequel is a shoddy product thats exposed for the cashmilking vehicle it really is  last years speed 2 and scream 2  as well as this years species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory  in some cases  a sequel can even discredit its predecessor  as with the latest neoslasher flick  i still know what you did last summer  whatever uniqueness the original mightve had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller  julie james  jennifer love hewitt  and ray bronson  freddie prinze jr   are back from the original to star in i still know  reprising their roles in typical fashion  julie and ray experience a rather predictable fallingout at the beginning of the movie  leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson  matthew settle   will and julie hit it off  and along with friends karla  brandy norwood  and tyrell  mekhi phifer   the foursome heads off to a radio stationgiveaway vacation in the tropics  unfortunately  things arent so peachy once they arrive  and with a regularity you could set your watch by  the infamous fisherman  muse watson  is back with his hook  its another bloody showdown  complete with cliffhanger ending  theres not much thats original about i still know  and with the market saturated by genx thrillers like this one  its unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel  for diehard fans of the genre  this will be required viewing material  but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer  the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isnt heightened by skillful scripting or camera work  but rather a tense  stringbased score and manipulative editing  the man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue  he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments  much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point  the whole reason the plot exists  julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station  is a dead giveaway  lessening suspense and creating a hurryupandwait timing problem  and  whereas the killers identity mightve been a question in the first movie  its almost a given here  which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically  three or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as  the killer   theyre almost used to it  and the performances show it  not hewitt  nor prinze  nor brandy  nor phifer give a decent show  and so  in the end  its left wide open for a third movie and  most likely  a brand new supporting cast  god help us  
1	steve soderberghs  sex  lies  and videotape   which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival in 1989  arguably began the resurgence of independent films  made on a shoestring budget of 1  2 million  with then relatively unknown actors  it is a provocative  thoroughly original drama  the film mostly focuses on the four central characters  all in their late 20searly 30s  ann  andie macdowell   an unfulfilled housewife  is married to john  peter gallagher   an insensitive lawyer  who  unbeknownst to her  is having an affair with her younger sister  cynthia  laura san giacomo   complicating matters even worse is graham  james spader  who won best actor at cannes   johns old college buddy  who comes to stay at their house  ann is absolutely won over by him  even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex  that is the setup for the last hour of the picture  and since the film is entitled   sex  lies  and videotape   it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise  director steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker  ranging from the independent  to the mainstream  1998s  out of sight    to the downright kafkaesque  1997s  schizopolis    he is the type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances  and believes in the work that he does  and   sex  lies  and videotape   is probably his most confident  and maybe even best  to date  the performances are superb from all four leads  but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character  she is always a very winning actress  but this is probably her most threedimensional role that she has had  with a close second being altmans 1993 mosaic   short cuts    the other parts are perfectly cast as well  from spaders ominous graham  to gallaghers selfinvolved john  to giacomos outspoken cynthia  the final act of the film  especially  comes right out of left field  and turns out to be both shocking and oddly touching  and it would be criminal to give away the films secrets  suffice to say that  through one powerful sequence  ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell  and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty  as well as deception  the film has one fault  however  the characters are almost all emotionally cold and isolated from one another  and often unlikable  if there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher  it probably would have helped  since his relationship with macdowell isnt quite as explored as i would have liked    sex  lies  and videotape   although minorly flawed  is still easily a brave and adult motion picture that is far more mature and honest about its subject matter than the usual film  soderbergh clearly knew what he was doing while he was making it  and the final product certainly proves this

1	contrary to the title   the boxer  is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics  its actually three movies in one  a political film  a boxing film  and a love story  all of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story  but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal  weve seen it all before  and were just not blown away with it like we should be  oh well  its still an excellent irish story    the boxer  of the title is danny flynn  jim sheridan staple daniel daylewis   an exira member who gets out of a belfast prison after 14 years  and finds out that his troubles are far from over  first off  the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill  brian cox   and one of its subleaders  harry  gerard mcsorley   both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail  while this is going on  danny and his old drunkard buddie  ike  ken stott  who played the chief inspector in danny boyles  shallow grave    reopen an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects  protestant and catholics  to work together  danny not only begins teaching kids how to box  but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison  and is ready to start boxing real people again  and danny runs into his exlove  maggie   breaking the waves  s emily watson   who hasnt seen him since he went in  they dont easily start up their romance again because shes the wife of a prisoner whom she married during dannys tenure in prison  and also has a son  liam  ciaran fitzgerald   from him  whom liam is hoping will get out soon  but the two are slowly redrawn to eachother again  and this begins to complicate things  the political story is nothing really special but works in itself  weve seen it many a time before  but its at least interesting  sometimes emotional  and even riveting at times  theres a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty  the boxing story is very minor to the story  but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly  and even with good sportsmanship  there are only a few boxing scenes  but theyre never like  raging bull  letsstripdownthesporttoitsbones brilliant  theyre more realistic  and instead of bone crunching  we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother  which is slightly unerving at times  and i didnt know daniel daylewis was in such good shape  but the backbone of the story is the love one  because these characters are given such horrible circumstances  and since the two leads have such great chemistry together  we really feel for their plight  as the film goes on  and circumstances get worse and worse  the characters have to make real human decisions  and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters  this is how you write a love story  take note  hollywood  these elements are pretty much equally balanced  with each of the parts of the stories working handinhand with eachother  i loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered  and sometimes spilled over into the next  it made sure that we didnt just care for one of them  im not saying theyre all equally great  because the love story really carries the film  but at least they all work out respectively  the acting is amazing  with daylewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry  im not sure if theyre oscarnominee bound  but theyre very good  in the supporting roles  billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers  but the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike  who is just a great scene stealer  the direction and cowriting by jim sheridan  with the other cowriting credit going to terry george  is excellent  rounding out the characters well  but not pacing everything greatly  i noticed that the first half was very leisurely  yet fascinating   but the second half whirls by at a quick pace  and ends much too quickly  more time could have been spent thinking up the ending  since it does seem quite sloppy  though  the boxer  is a good film  it never achieves the greatness that it should  sure  its a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get  but on its own  it just could have been better  but it still works out  gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama  and features great acting  even if it could have been better  thisll do  
1	set in the late 80s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis  who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie  less than zero   american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie  genre  that ellis helped to create  christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman  a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc  e and his colleagues  it seems that bateman is a serial killer and  unfortunately for his contemporaries  his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip  as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering coworkers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies  his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel  i was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school  i read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it  as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out  but i soon forgot about the novel and didnt end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore  i picked it up and read it  but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers  the movie has a similar effect  but at least its less cryptic than ellis novel  for once  a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on  both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations  down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses  but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout  the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in batemans impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does  as a result  the film is immensely more entertaining  lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films  having picked up kevin smiths catholicrattling dogma  and here with american psycho there is no difference  screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it  some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc17  mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women  and initial reports said the film was unwatchable  thankfully  it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park  bigger  longer  uncut  side note 1  cowriter guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an illfated acquaintance of batemans who  after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute  proclaims that shes not a lesbian nor has any interest in it  the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner  the writerdirector of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy  is a lesbian  its a subtle injoke and its one i found to be pretty humorous  despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young upandcomers  including reese witherspoon   most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos  the real draw here is christian bale and his overthetop performance as patrick bateman  whenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters  i always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman  but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being  to say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that hes as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger  one sequence in particular  involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news song  hip to be square  right before burying an axe in a coworkers head  features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film  side note 2  despite the fact that huey lewis  hip to be square  and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film  dont expect to see them on the soundtrack release  huey lewis expressly requested that his song  featured in a rather large set piece in the film  much akin to the use of  stuck in the middle with you  in reservoir dogs   not be included on any soundtrack release  im assuming that collins requested the same  on a similar note  whitney houstons cover of  the greatest love of all  is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isnt the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source  apparently  houston wasnt as open about the use of her song as the others were  a bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the films release  that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film  dont look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more  several web sites have been dedicated to the subject but im still undecided  there is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops  old ladies  and cleaning staff with equal gusto  the scene seemed very dreamlike and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying  as an example  bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car   i kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there  but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence  though comic  throws the film offbalance  which i suppose was the intention   other than the few flaws i have mentioned  american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film  although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in batemans reality   i think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such  it may not change anyones life  but it will certainly have an effect  i know i will certainly hear  hip to be square  in a different context the next time i hear it  r 
0	  american pie  alums jason biggs and mena suvari star in this summers attempt to capitalize on the youth market looking for a comedy about young people they can relate to that combines generic hollywood cute coupleness and zany comedy  its about an a student  biggs as  paul   who gets a scholarship to some college in new york city who sticks out like a sore thumb and falls for dora  suvari  a ditzy heroinchic goth chick who has no ambition or selfrespect whatsoever and allows herself to be pushed around just like  hickboy  paul is  so weve got a fishoutwater formula mixed with meetcute romantic comedy which ideally should make for a good movie  unfortunately the atrocious screenplay and boring direction by  clueless  auteur amy heckerling successfully manages to screw up everything about the film  these characters are totally unrealistic and unbelievable  its as if everyone under age 30 is a stoned raver  theres no background or details to anyone or anything  its just a bunch of cartoon characters running into each other  not to mention the story itself which is virtually nonexistant and contains so many plotholes its like swiss cheese  even the basic editing is bad  if youre looking for a romantic comedy stay far away from this one because it is neither romantic nor funny  i saw this in a packed cinema on opening night and the audience barely laughed at all  if youve seen the commericials youve seen all the  funny  parts  which are all from the first five minutes   
1	its no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office  a poorlywritten script can be bested by a superb acting corps  and a wellwritten piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs  in directing his latest actioncomedy  director brett ratner  money talks  takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all getout buddy cop movie  in addition  rush hour serves as a firstclass example of directing a movie with conservative attitude  a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types  the two lead names share equal screen time here  mostly because they spend it together  jackie chan  in his first completely american production  makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts  the other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago  knock off  stands no chance against the content of this one  chan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise  and theres no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldnt believe their eyes the first time  chris tucker  on the opposite side  relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chans performance  he works perfectly with the script  and its quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines  almost essential to the action genre  the plot is nonexistent  were quickly introduced to detective james carter  tucker  is a maverick officer for the lapd  cut forward to another scene where the daughter  julia hsu  of the american chinese consul  tzi ma  is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters  the fbi is quick to the rescue  but the consul insists that one of his men  detective inspector lee  chan   be brought on the case to help  the fbi resists  but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective  its here that carter and lee hook up  and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up  rattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up  but it doesnt quite reach the top tier of actioncomedies like last years grosse pointe blank  there are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to  and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan  this might be a major drawback  also  some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride  and others are there simply to look menacing  however  none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background  almost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another  whether its tuckers toneddown routine or chans tight rein on his action sequences  and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types  a recommendable visit to the theater  indeed

1	martin scorseses kundun  which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama  has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure  personally  i dont think it needs one  it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china  scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do  as a largerthanlife symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership  the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences  but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal  the set design and cinematography are outstanding  and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle  it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao  political art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans  kundun does not  it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative  
0	2 days in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off  it basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways  im not going into much greater detail than that  since it would take forever to explain  and quite frankly  im not willing to spend any more time on it than the 2 hours that ive already wasted  while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction  2 days in the valley falls way short  this is quite a condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello  james spader and jeff daniels  while the story isnt much  and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better  2 days in the valley does have a couple of bright spots  james spaders character  while not much better than the rest  is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way  and we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron  in her first role   you know a movie isnt that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women  even if they are both gorgeous  i will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted  but marveling at that ingenuity is a far cry from actually enjoying the result  while some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting  they inevitably are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the characters that i really cared absolutely nothing about  if i were to put a number on it  only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch  this is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent  and even then prepare for disappointment  not even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again  or at least not all of it anyway

0	i cant recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota  for forty minutes or so  i was lured into a loopy if occasionally overwrought romantic comedy  and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt  then  rather suddenly  i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence  shortly thereafter  i was whacked in the gut by another  feeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated  as though i had trusted writerdirector steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face  feeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie  cameron diaz  who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red  delroy lindo  suspects her of stealing from him  reds punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper  sam clayton  vincent donofrio   who is far from the man of freddies dreams  enter jjaks  keanu reeves   sams estranged younger brother  who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddies eye and have sex with her in the bathroom  united in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam  jjaks and freddie take off together  but sam isnt ready to let them go without a fight  freddie  meanwhile  isnt ready to let sams money go without a fight  and thus begins a series of violent confrontations  there is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota  as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sams intense sibling rivalry as boys  and their mother  tuesday weld  sending jjaks away to live with his father  it does a great job of setting up jjaks unstable life  a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family  reeves wounded look is just right for jjaks  the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments  most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin  most important  baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy  as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements  i will dare  on the car radio  you would have every reason to expect that relationships  both familial and romantic  would be the focal point of feeling minnesota  unfortunately  you would be dead wrong  i suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding  but i certainly didnt expect what i got  what i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality  or rather creating gags about brutality  suddenly  the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse  and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable  the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another  but there is no consistency to the characterizations  vincent donofrio turns in a manic performance as sam  whose jealousy  competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks  while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction  and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood  there are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully  jonathan demmes something wild and neil jordans the crying game come to mind   but they didnt try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment  i dont want to dismiss baigelmans successes out of hand  he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop  and some wellcrafted comic moments  and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a lighthearted caper  it is his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value  and that he cant make his two halves into a whole  feeling minnesota left me feeling used  and theres not much funny about that  
1	it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a  i  artificial intelligence  just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted to the material  for here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home  an outcast seeking family  themes very familiar from most of spielbergs body of work from sugarland express to close encounters of the third kind to e  t  to empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan  naming just a few examples  a  i  is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies  it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances  the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions  and with the number of births limited by the government  many couples are yearning for children  and professor hobby  william hurt  has the solution  a robotic boy named david  haley joel osment   who is programmed to love  as a test  david is placed with henry swinton  sam robards  and his wife  monica  frances oconnor   their naturalborn son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for his illness  the first third of a  i  deals with davids life with the swintons and how that is changed by the recovery and return of their son  martin  circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons  he is abandoned and alone  david  highly influenced by the fairy tale  pinocchio  feels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monicas love for him  the films second act follows davids search for the blue fairy  whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish  during these adventures he meets and is helped by gigolo joe  jude law   a robot who specializes in sex  spielberg is at his top form in this sequence  offering a brutal  flesh fair  where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers  here  is where kubricks influence is strongly felt  as the movie explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots  the savagery conjures up images from the late directors a clockwork orange  at about two hours and 30 minutes  the film begins to falter during the last 20 minutes  a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters  it is all very anticlimatic and jarring  these scenes seem almost superfluous  as if from a different film  a  i  is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg13 rating  it is a story combining hope and intolerance  sacrifice and bigotry  and while it does not coalesce perfectly  the movie does offer some disturbing images  but a  i  is really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment  if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination  it is this lad  who brings a sense of joy and wonder to the role of david  a being created for the express purpose of loving  he shines when with monica  beaming with love  as eager as a puppy to please  after being left in the woods  he is confused  lost  hurt  focusing on one objective  to become a real boy and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mothers eyes  law is pleasant as the carefree robot who really doesnt understand davids quest  but is nonetheless happy to help him on his journey  probably the toughest role is oconnors monica  playing an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin  she grows conflicted after her boy returns and she begins to perceive david not as a second chance  but as a threat to her family  she gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her course of action  many of a  i  s futuristic sets are breathtaking  especially a mostly submerged new york  lost to the world by the melting of the polar ice caps  a  i  is a flawed film  and you cannot get through the entire feature without pondering  even subconsciously  how it would have turned out with kubrick instead of spielberg behind the camera  would it have been darker  more cynical  we will never know  we can only judge what is before us on the screen  a collaboration of two cinematic giants  a  i  is a most interesting and thoughtprovoking examination of a future that is quickly gaining on us

1	apparently  director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film  american history x  i dont know the details of the fight  but it seems that he is not happy with the final product  and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether  ive heard about this kind of thing happening before  and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce  as it is  i found american history x to be an extremely good film  not just because of tony kayes focused look at the touchy subject of racism  but because of a powerful  charismatic performance from edward norton  its hard to believe that it has only been two years since nortons fantastic role in primal fear  but  here he is now  starring in his own film and making himself a star  norton is one of those performers who becomes his character  and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year  he plays a young man named derek vinyard  a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother  danny  edward furlong   mother  beverly dangelo   and sister  davin  jennifer lien   the film opens with a flashback  in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car  we find out that this lands him in prison  and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny  in the presenttime of the film  danny is in high school  and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother  much of the film is told in flashback  and we see the path that leads to dereks adoption of white supremacy  when derek is released  having served three years in prison  he finds that his brother is now a fullblown skinhead  derek  however  has given up the violence  and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things  what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid  thoughtless people  they are intelligent and articulate  and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms  its hard to make a controversial movie and not preach  but kaye has found the right note for his material  because american history x is a mainstream film  there has to be a redemption phase for our main character  some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic  i partially disagree with this  because  although i do not advocate racism in any way  its interesting the way kaye presents derek  he is a loud  obnoxious man  but hes also very smart  the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable  his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men  its clear that hes passionate about his beliefs  and that hes not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up  of course  it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part  its astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest  in addition to getting the look just right  hes perfect for this role  derek requires intelligence  depth  and a whole lot of shouting  and norton does it all with ease  even when hes at his meanest  derek has a likable quality to him  and thats a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead  what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of dannys school  avery brooks  becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny  the other performances are all terrific  with standouts from furlong  dangelo  and lien  visually  the film is very powerful  kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices  and most of them work nicely  lots of slowmotion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere  but  like a lot of movies lately  american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes  although the climactic scene is very moving  the picture ends with a pretentious  preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed  for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point  it felt like a slap in the face to be handfed a theme in such a simplistic way  it makes me wonder what  exactly  tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film  perhaps this last scene was the problem  its hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good  in a time when so many movies are timid and weak  american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way  
0	while watching loser  it occurred to me that amy heckerlings true genius as a filmmaker is casting  in fast times at ridgemont high  she gave us sean penns jeff spicoli  in look whos talking  she turned bruce willis into a wisecracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival  in clueless  she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is  or was  alicia silverstone  she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws  unfortunately  she may also be starting to understand that she understands  giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies  giving appealing actors a script in which their appeal is the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser  naturally  heckerling makes her protagonist an allaround swell guy  paul tannek  jason biggs  is a smalltown boy who gets a scholarship to nyu  then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the coldhearted big city  paul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman  his roommates adam  zak orth   chris  tom sadoski  and noah  jimmi simpson  are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul  paul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar  in this case the lovely dora diamond  mena suvari   dora has problems of her own  including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor  edward alcott  greg kinnear   thats more than slightly onesided  theyre two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people  so clearly they belong together  even if paul is a loser  i must confess that  for a while  i was suckered in by heckerlings casting  jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace  suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence  theyre pleasant enough to watch  and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists arent  then it gradually becomes clear that theres virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort  in theory  loser is a romantic comedy  but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film  notable exception  a cameo by a scenestealing comic actor as a video store clerk   instead of taking any time to make the characters situations funny  heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters situations pathetic  she shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless  nor any of that films interest in lively plotting  not surprisingly  since cluelesss plot came via jane austens emma   she simply turns the film into a pity party  since loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character  you might think that those characters would be interesting  or at least slightly complicated  instead  you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that theres no reason to watch them  paul isnt just a nice guy  hes flawless  consequently  hes a central character who does absolutely no growing  his roommates arent just inconsiderate  theyre actively evilblackmailing professor alcott  drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name  and professor alcott isnt just manipulative  he turns dora into his house slave  doras unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser  and even that isnt explored in sufficient detail  theres more ambiguity in the 30second snippet from alan cummings broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser its one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations  its another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush  and it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow    i dont know    comic  still  i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora  that hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkels  scarborough faircanticle   instead of giving the sequence a knowing winka reference to the graduate  a hint that paul is becoming an overlysensitive clichheckerling plays it deadly straight  even in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonists foibles  she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint  cluelesss cher had her selfabsorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness  in loser  amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness  her one show of wit involves naming pauls dorm  hunts hall  after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall   her gift with casting proved to be her curse  loser may be a crashing bore  but gee  arent those two kids swell  
1	capsule  suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight action flick  which isnt necessarily a bad thing  not exactly oscar caliber  but one helluva bulletriddled good time  extended review  you know  i remember when hitmen were evil  murderous scum  alas  the times are achangin  in a recent string of movies  hitmen are suddenly wise cracking  funloving killerswithhearts  this brings us to hong kong director kirk wongs first american feature  the big hit  oddly enough  about the same time last year a similar film  grosse point blank  was released  advertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action  it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it  the big hit is quite the opposite  it was hyped as  the new film from producer john woo   so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action  however  theres a sore lack of it  which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit  the film starts out with mel smiley and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver  mel  played by mark wahlberg in a dopey  milquetoast role  is a killing machine  he flips  spins  even breakdances whilst popping caps  sadly  he doesnt get a chance to do much of it  except for the beginning set piece and the last 20 twenty minutes or so  the film is in comedy mode  the action  at least what there is of it  is prime cut stuff  wong  after numerous hong kong features  makes quite a nice u  s  debut  however  his pacing is a bit off  with the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough  they start off electrifying and fresh  but just kinda stop  normally  this would hamper a movie to the point of being unenjoyable  luckily  we have ben ramseys screenplay  a bitingly funny piece of work  the only problem is there might be too much humor  one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few  some of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck and one of mels hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism  the only problem is how some of the minor characters are handled  some being there only for a laugh  which sometimes works  sometimes doesnt  overall  the big hit may have its flaws  but it makes up for them in a stylishly directed  gutwrenchingly funny joyride  definately one of the better ways to spend two hours  
0	boy  what a great movie   keanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together  the director of the fugitive  andrew davis  back again to give us another thriller  and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot  how could this not be a blockbuster  all diehard keanu reeves fans  read on  ol  much ado about nothing  plays eddie kasalivich  a machinist studying at the university of chicago  to help pay for the rent  he takes on this job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university  by happy coincidence  he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics  this project holds great promise  taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in  a potential solution to the earths energy problems without the pollution cost  surely nobody could have any problems with that  morgan freeman is paul shannon  the projects sponsor  he works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public  he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly  so he murders the project leader  blows up the project  great but short scene here  sort of like a mini id4 citydevastation thing  and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hitech hushhush location  unfortunately  our intrepid machinist and an english physicist  weisz  manage to get away and now follows a fugitivelike chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script  this movie is just dying for a comparison with  the fugitive   both movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesnt change much  i guess we cant really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere  the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones  chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward  credit to them  but we arent really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters  where ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy  eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves character is never given the time to develop  it might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences  which frankly  get quite boring after a while  harrison ford was  the man against the world   he was alone in a world where he didnt know who to trust and it came across real well  in chain reaction  keanu reeves isnt alone  now that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia  vulnerability and confusion  we dont get this  we get him thinking hes still in speed  only now our sandra bullock has an english accent  probably doesnt drive a bus  and hardly contributes anything to the movie  the producers here probably thought   hey  what if keanu and rachel dont hit it off too well  lets rope in that morgan to help us out   well  keanu and rachel didnt hit it off well on the screen  and most unfortunately  morgan freeman doesnt help much either  the only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder  its not really his fault  once again  andrew davis just doesnt take the time to build his characters  someone must have convinced him that this time round  cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken  the flying inkpot rating system   wait for the tv2 broadcast     a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha      pretty good  bring a friend       amazing  potent stuff        perfection  see it twice

0	lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4  episode 1 is a boring  empty spectacle that features some nice special effects  after the familiar a long time ago      opening  the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game  the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo  ruled by queen amidala  portman  jedi knights quigon  neeson  and obi wan  mcgregor  are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade  however  this simple blockade is not all it seems  and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers  including facing the evil darth maul  ray park   they also meet the future darth vadar  anakin skywalker  jake lloyd  star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking  script  direction and characters  the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic  the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star  and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more nonexistent  theres no underlying tension  and no urgent need to see what the outcome is  the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story  which doesnt help  theres no snap to make the film work  it moves at a plod  the script is boring  all the characters speak in morals  especially anakins mother  theres no group spirit evident here  and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders  its evident that not much is going to happen  the two leads are hideously boring  static characters given little to do and too much time to do it  quigon and obiwan hold no presence on film  and give little for the audience to root for  the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul  if he had been given more screen time  maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history  even if he does provide the only straight plot line in the film  all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy   anakin is annoying and unlikeable   instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended  its probably not surprising that his hateful little boy  unfortunately blessed ani by everyone he knows  joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible  the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks  although in the end none is provided in the film by him  although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys  the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny  the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a pod racer  because i knew he wouldnt be able to talk for a while  queen amidala is a nothing in the film  she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must serve her people   and go googoo over anakin  again  her role will become more important in the later episodes  and is given little to do here  the actors dont help the movie much either  liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed  and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible  mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy  with little charm  the casting director must have chose him because hes scottish like alec guinness  theres little other explanation for it  natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script  but she delivers a spunky performance  and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice  theres very little talent evident with him  its hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there  hes not even very cute   the main claim of the film  the special effects  are okay  theres nothing impressive about them  yet they complement the story well  the cgi takes away much of the human element  however  the battle droids for example  the replacement for the stormtroopers  are characterless little computer graphics  lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers  episode 1 is just disappointing  its got high production values  but little else  the music is meandering  except near the end  the plot gives us noone to root for  or even care for  the effects are nice  but dull  the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should  theres an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair  and many clich  s are catered for throughout the film  apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence  episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose  except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film  disappointing is barely the word  rating

0	movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good  the bad  and the despicable  i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in 95  but i wanted to rewrite it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics  we need to be warned about some truly awful films  too  this picture was so bad  it inspired the description for my 110 rating  see ratings chart below   the only thing saving it from a 010 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno  so  it does indeed have some plusses    in fairness  elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff  and her ability to whine and irritate us  even while nude  was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone  this character is not smart  not interesting  and  deliberately   far too annoying far too often  like in 1998s  bulworth   when the movie was over i didnt care one little iota about the main character  at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film  though    showgirls  is too stupid to make a statement  some people claim that the story is based on the legendary  all about eve  of all things  if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l  mankiewicz was  hed be    well  hed be a good screenwriter  instead  this project may have sunk his career  he wrote the  ha ha   script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed  the same team who created a good sexfilm in 1992   basic instinct   struck out here with their occasional violence  gratuitous xrated sex scenes  and numerous  and quite unnecessary  lesbian overtones  the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer  after the supposed streetsmart young  lady  gets conned out of her suitcase by a slackjawed yokel in the opening sequence  she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the  stardust hotel   nomi doesnt take advantage of this contact to break into the bigtime of dirty dancing right away  first  she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club  she sells her hot little wares at  the cheetah  for a short time  turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience  hey  i never said she wasnt a hot number    maybe its that  her body  which gets her into the bigtime when the star of the  stardust hotel   crystal connors  gina gershon  stops into the strip club  it certainly isnt her brains or pleasant disposition    crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend  kyle maclachlan   he also happens to be the pleasureseeking worm who runs the big show  crystal gets nomi onto the  stardust  team and  after an interminable amount of time  nomi  earns  the role of crystals understudy  the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal  it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that shes  not a whore   thats a phrase we hear a few different times and its completely ludicrous  of course she is  she sells her soul to make it big  but in the end were supposed to believe that shes a better person than that  were supposed to root for her  no way  shes a tramp and a backstabber who deserved nothingleast of all vindication in the    ahem    climax  she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is  the subplot with a male dancer  glenn plummer  who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more  it sure aint character development  plummer also appeared in  speed  in 94 in a smaller  yet better role  this subplot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control  kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big payday or his standards have dipped since appearing in  blue velvet   that picture was weird  but some critics claim its one of the best movies of the 80s  now ol kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the 90s  too  his sleazy character is important to  showgirls   but we dont learn anything about him  he uses people to get what he wants  but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie  is he a villain  who cares  ultimately  this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit  everyone must know by now about the softcore acts of copulation  especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool  what few reviewers take issue with is how meanspirited this movie is  everyones either having sex  exacting revenge  or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge  its just too hard to take  especially for over two hours   if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world  why couldnt verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers  grunts  and other sounds during the dance numbers  its hard to care about these people if we cant even appreciate what theyre capable of doing onstage  berkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body  after all  the world of porn is still an active  dishonourable profession  perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford  oops  theyre bad actors  too  well  at least  theyre not selfish and contemptable like good ol slutty nomi malone  useless triviaironically  elizabeth berkley played virtuous and  holier than thou  jessie on the teenybopper tv show   saved by the bell   before breaking onto the big screen

1	in   the muse  albert brooks plays steven phillips  a hollywood screenwriter who after winning a humanitarian award for his work is dumped by his studio  they claim that hes lost his edge and his agent is quick to agree with them  he knows that he needs to write something fresh and original and quick or else his career will be over  so he turns to his  best  friend  jack  jeff bridges  another screenwriter whos enjoyed success after success  on the way over to jacks house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman  sharon stone  into a cab and begins to think  is he having an affair  when confronted  jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is  in fact  a muse  a mythological figure who is believed to have inspired all creativity  and has helped him garner his success    she doesnt do any actual writing   he is told   but inspires you   steven is excited by what hes hearing and asks jack to call her up to see if shell take steven on as a new client  jack arranges a meeting between the two and suggests that steven bring her a present  preferably something from tiffanys  after the meeting the muse  sarah decides to take on steven  but at a price  she wants a suite at the four seasons and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her  like bringing her salads in the middle of the night   stevens wife  andy macdowell  sees him at a food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon  steven confesses everything and  although at first suspicious  she later allows sarah to move into their guest room and eventually into their life  the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble hes going through for her  and thats a question only time will tell    the muse  is albert brooks sixth film as writerdirectoractor  he cowrote with monica johnson  and although its a good movie its not up to the level of his best works   defending your life  and  mother    the problem lies in the script  and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor  there arent nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good oneliners  it has a great premise but doesnt deliver up to its full potential  but  i like albert brooks in this film and i think that we can all identify with steven phillips a little bit  he may whine and complain  but he just wants to support his family and be happy  and i like sharon stone in this movie too  its a nice change of pace for her  and i also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes of rob reiner  james cameron and martin scorsese  and although  the muse  doesnt have as much to say about hollywood as robert altmans  the player  i still left the theater feeling good  and thats something i wish i got out of more movies  
1	scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well  during a filmclass discussion  windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are  and why sequels never live up to the originals  a few rare exceptions are noted  but they left out one      scream 2  1996s surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america  a sequel was unavoidable  but luckily the reteaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment  in fact  at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream  i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film  sidney prescott  neve campbell   the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro  ca in the original scream  is now two years older and off to college  majoring in theater  meanwhile  tv journalist gale weathers  courtney cox   who covered the murders in the first film  has since written a book about the dreadful events  a book titled  stab   which has been developed into a major motion picture  as scream 2 opens  a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of  stab   and before long  a young couple are butchered to death  unnoticed in the midst of hysteria  this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown  copycat  sets out to repeat whats been done      and finish what hasnt  of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film  and yes  movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as heshe goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds  but this  is  a sequel  and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies  this is in large part due to williamsons deliciously written script  which will easily leave you satisfied  as much as the film condemns the use of cliches  it is riddled with them  but it is done so effectively  and with skillful direction by craven  that youre not bound to complain  i will note  however  that the  whodunit   did wind up being the first person i suspected  but believe me  i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie  all the actors outdo themselves here  were not talking oscar performances  but cambell  cox  david arquette as dewey riley  and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing  the characters remain true to their roots  and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years  we can see how the events in the first film has affected them  but we dont lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place  the nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesnt seem offkilter from its predecessor  its a natural  smooth  and believable  as far as horror films go  transition from film to film  we skip two years  but there doesnt seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks  it flows so well that you feel more like youre reading chapter two of a book  long chapters  eh   than just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces  while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels  scream 2s entire plot structure correlates  completely  with the first  making for immediate fondness and absorption  as i said before  scream 2 easily lives up to  if not surpassing  its precursor  the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first  this doesnt mean that it overcasts the unique  whimsical humor or overall caliber of its sequel  it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked its own while maintaining its soughtafter qualities  if ever a film followed its original so well  it would be scream 2  and it makes this a definite mustsee for all those unbridled scream fans out there  scream 2 fits snugly alongside scream  and will hopefully receive as many high remarks  it would top off the series quite well  if it werent for the fact that two movies dont really make a series  its unlikely to assume that a scream 3 wont appear in the next few years  but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horrortrilogy  lets hope they can keep up the fantastic work  like they say  dont mess with perfection      but when a moneymaking smashhit is almost guaranteed  whos gonna listen  
0	if you havent plunked down your hardearned money yet for  wild wild west   the latest summer holiday offering from will smith  let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbucks frappacino or on a ben  jerrys sundae  these treats are great relief from the summer heat  in contrast  this film made me simmer in disappointment  i can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take a back seat  this was true of star wars episode i  but at least in that film  the story and the characters were still in the back seat  in this film  they are no where to be found  what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats  lots of female extras who look like cancan dancers  and a clunky  80foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula  two men are asked to stop this threat  one is artemus gordon  kevin kline   an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents  among his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest  the other man is jim west  will smith   who prefers the shootfirstthenshootsomemore method of investigating  although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success  their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate  twoman vaudevillian act  for example  there is a scene where west  being more debonair than the reserved gordon  notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat  which is what it is currently filled with    now touch my breast   west says  gordon does so and then softly coos his approval  i found myself groaning at this kind of silliness  the script fails to generate any sense of drama  humor  or fun for that matter  i did enjoy klines reserved performance  but was surprised at how much latitude they gave to smith  could it be that will smith is just so bankable that hes not even required to act  it was as if the director was yelling  will smith  do your own thing    and action   heres an example  in this scene  will smith is about to be hanged by a group of angry white people  he must endear himself to the crowd to escape  the director yells   will smith  do your own thing    and action   in another scene  he has to masquerade as a belly dancer in order to save his comrades    will smith  do your own thing    and action   worse still  the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is a horrid mess  there are cogs spinning and pulleys pulling and levers going up and down everywhere you look  theres actually a lot of imagination at work in this film  there are some genuinely clever inventions and gizmos introduced  but all of this imagination is wasted in a film that is visually cluttered and dramatically flat  and thats too bad because if there was more focus on the story rather than will smith just doing his thing   this film might have been palatable  as it turns out   wild wild west  is the wild  wild worst and receives my vote for biggest disappointment of the year  
1	the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen kings work  this slowmoving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals  but suffers from a tepid conclusion  inconsistent direction  and may not have wide commercial appeal  when the maid  dolores claiborne  is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer  it seems like an openandshut murder case  upon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax  dolores estranged and bitter daughter  esquire magazine writer selena st  george  returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home  as the two clash horns  the story behind the mysterious death of dolores abusive husband two decades ago  ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey  is revealed  did dolores kill her husband  and did she kill her employer  dolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller  consequently  it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywoods finest character actors  such as bates  leigh and strathairn  kathy bates plays the films title character  and gives a sensational lead performance  dolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates  as her character has a huge amount of screen time  she dominates the screen  producing a character that is compelling and arresting  as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks  kathy bates performance is awardcalibre stuff  the rest of the cast is also very good  jennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour  bitter helena st  george well  and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores everpresent nemesis  the determined detective john mackey  david strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores husband  joe st  george  judy parfitt is fine as dolores tyrannic socialite employer  vera donovanit would have been interesting to see  say  meg foster in this role  child actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences  she is very impressive  the direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film  ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right  to parts which are embarrassingly hokey  the segues between flashbacks and the present are very hitandmiss in terms of effectiveness  the pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow  which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up  however  the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderfuli particularly like the chilling iceblue hue permeating the presentday scenes  contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shotsand danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film  it would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited  none of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw  and its pacing may be a turnoff to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axewielding psychopaths  although being essentially the only film in its genre in release now  it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works  even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand  dolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion  and moves very slowly  however  the performances are uniformly excellent  particularly kathy bates  and the film has its moments  on my fourstar scale  i give dolores claiborne three stars  
0	if theres one thing i just cant stand  its a film that oozes with sentimentality  heres a note to all film makers  films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves  swelling  saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy  and that the situation is hopeless  alas  my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up  what reminded me was that i wasnt choked up  or even the slightest bit moved  for that matter  my giant is a forced  contrived  and conspicuously uncute  i detest the word  cute  but ive chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a  cute  film here   it takes a premise that might have been interesting  i liked the preview   and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches  all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience  maybe it will work for some people  it didnt work for me  billy crystal plays sam cayman  an agent who  at the beginning of the film  is in romania  hes in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film  the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired  get in a car accident  and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall  his name is max  gheorghe muresan   and sam thinks hed be a great movie star because of his size  subplots are as follows  sam has a son and a wife  kathleen quinlan   and hes never around for them  so they move to chicago  max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins  sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money  and so their various subplots can all be resolved  sam is broke  max is dying  pass the kleenex  my giant  as a comedy  is only moderately funny  it has its moments  the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself  in one great scene  sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal  of course  his son doesnt believe that hes actually speaking to seagal  and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is  i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect   crystal is always entertaining  and he has a few good lines here  some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely   often  however  hes countered by a slew of jokes that arent funny  and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes  muresan is kind of fun to watch  but he just cant act very well  quinlan  on the other hand  is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents  she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown  but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff  here  the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent  all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that  for much of its running time  is simply mediocre  as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion  however  director michael lehmann  who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk  and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable  each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings  sams multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed  how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family    later  it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sams reunion with his family  and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing  but i had a few morality problems with it  and i apologize for being vague   its icky  it drips with gooey  wannabe human emotions  my giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film  more importantly  it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is  instead  its a complicated  overlong  and underengaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears  and since it left me feeling completely unmoved  i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world  
0	how do you judge a film that is so bad  but intentionally so  in spiceworld  the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal  mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film and having a lot of fun doing it  if that was their goal  they did a fantastic job  so is it fair to give it such a low grade when it wasnt really meant to be much better than this  honestly  id rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades  so does that mean i graded it inaccurately  truth be known  i dont really think i can answer this question  to understand spiceworld  you have to understand the spice girls  unless youre very  very  young  or fairly older  you probably have at least heard of them  theyre a group of five busty british babes whove had 1 hit singles and whose debut album sold millions  theyre primarily adored by preteen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spices  real name  geri haliwell  wonderbra  all five of the girls have these  spicy  names for which they are better known than their real names  there is the aforementioned ginger spice  as well as sporty spice  melanie chisholm  or mel c    scary spice  melanie brown  or mel b    baby spice  emma bunton   and posh spice  victoria addams   and all of them  to some degree or another  resemble their stage names  the spice girls took the world by storm  and spiceworld is actually a good humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise to fame  its quite nice to see what good sports the girls are  and not just the one dubbed sporty  about poking fun at themselves  they dont take themselves too seriously  and thats probably the best thing about them  its also surprising how natural they seem in front of the camera  acting   and not just singing and dancing  theyre not flawless by any means  but for the most part  they deliver their lines without feeling staged  and  like them or not  we get the sense the five are very at home within their characters  which seems reasonable since they portray themselves   what makes the film bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls wont get enough of their music  while the rest of us dont get enough of a movie  the real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes  most of the film is very blas   but several parts are downright boring  and then they have those sporadic moments that actually make us laugh out loud  if youre a big fan of the group  you probably wont get enough of what you want  and if youre not a big fan  you get too much time devoted to nothing more than  look at us  moments  for the right crowd  the  music video  sequences will be the highlights of the film  but for others  they will serve as threeminute lulls in a hecticbutoveralluneventful storyline  other key actors include richard e  grant as clifford  the spice girls manager  alan cumming as the filmmaker piers cuthertonsmyth who attempts to make a documentary of the group  george wendt as martin barnfield  a producer who constantly works on pitching a spice girls movie  and roger moore in a small  selfparodizing role  all provide relatively good performances  keeping in mind once again that this film wasnt meant to be acted seriously  even meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver and seems to have fun with it  while this film is continuously compared to the beatles a hard days night  i think that is an unjust comparison  it is supposedly the movie studio that first mad the comparison by way of press kits  but i dont think drector bob spiers  nor the spice girls  intended it to be so  i think the studios were just trying to boost hype and interest in the film  and have instead  come off rather pretentious  i dont think this film is trying to be anything more than a fun  satirical look at a group that got so big  a movie seemed the next likely step  and what couldve been better than a selfindulged yet self mocking approach  probably nothing  and so it is  spiceworld is a movie i thought would be embarrassing to enjoy  but now instead  i find myself wanting to defend a movie i didnt even give a good review  its bad  but it succeeds in every way it intended  it gives the spice girls a chance to play while allowing all those obsessive fans out there to indulge in every brainless moment  perhaps the group is nothing more than a gimmick  if thats the case  the movies gimmick is that it  is  such a gimmick  you might be saying   a spice girls movie  come on    but when it comes down to it  i think thats the point

1	maybe the most important thing about this movie is that its not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month  because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker  broadcasted on abc on a monday night  starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth  respectively  because its not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why its so great  underneath the todiefor cinematography  the brilliant acting  and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty  not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it  tell it in a certain original way  it doesnt merely go from plot point to plot point  it goes from character to character  it obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all  and makes the story of a worldreknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters  both musicians  who have a totally unique relationship  its that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball  shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this  unlike  patch adams   effortlessly emotional and real  in short  this movie is just awesome  it merely tells its story really well  and thats something that just has to be commended these days  when most stories are botched because theyre not told by great storytellers  director anand tucker tells this story well  he overdramaticizes everything  but still keeps it real  the film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr   rachel griffiths and emily watson  respectively   two sisters who are first seen in childhood  played by auriol evans and keely flanders  respectively  as the very best of friends  they are also both musicians  hilary a flutist and jackie a cellist  and when it all begins  both are considered child prodigies  but hilary is seen as the better of the two  jackie  a bit jealous  works and works at her playing skills  and soon the tables are turned  when they both hit adulthood  hilary strives for a comeback  while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world  but instead of fame  captures the heart of a hapless  joyful conductor  kiffer finzi  david morissey  in a semistarmaking turn   they marry  after a short courtship  and move to a lovely country house  making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life  when she plays  she has the eyes of the world  but when she stops  shes alone  she enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist  daniel barenboim  james frain   in hopes that she may overcloud her sister  but she eventually begins to lose it  and runs away to hilarys country home  where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband  since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure  its all terribly melodramtic  as you can see  and by the time jackie has contracted ms  in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semismiliar  shine  in technical and emotional devastation   it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadnt been handled in such a way  the key thing here is that its not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that its about her tumultuous relationship with her sister  which  i might add  is perfectly realized  their relationship is the most downtoearth complex entity of the year  they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world  but theyre also completely jealous of one another  when a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities  she tries in vain to make a comeback but cant  and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success  when jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man  she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that ive ever seen in a film  only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man   and the whole time  their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested  another thing i really liked is emily watsons performance  i usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease  or any combination of the three   my reasoning for this is that its a fucking easy job  the worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in  beloved   sure  shes good  but whats so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around  slurs her words together  and acts like a three year old inside a 20year olds body  hell  i could play that if i had a pair of breasts  in that same exact movie  though  is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane  her brothers run off never to be seen again  and her mothers lover is scared off  she has to actually deal with real emotions  something much harder than mere stumbling about  but the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons  if you dont believe me  look at jack nicholsons performance in  as good as it gets   great performance  but easy job  this isnt so for watson  though  because her insanity comes from real emotions  not just a plot point  and thanks to the opening sequence  where we see her and hilary as kids  we understand the motives behind all her actions  and by the time she actually contracts ms and begins to loose her sanity and her life  weve already understood that this is the last straw for a woman plagued with terrible neuroses  rachel griffiths  who would have otherwise been the understudy to watsons protagonist  actually matches watson stepforstep  because as watson grows insane  and demands unspeakable things from her  griffiths holds her own  and has to deal with what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her  griffiths  an otherwise unknown actress  and watson being famous from  breaking the waves  and  the boxer    is absolutely brilliant  just as absolutely brilliant as watson is  and if the academy and all the other critics groups  whove already deemed watsons performance the best of the year  glance over hers because shes the one who doesnt get to go insane  read  she gets the boring role   then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me  after all  griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real  the tom cruise role in  rainman   the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman   she does  and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year  its griffiths  together  the two actresses work extremely well  though  and both have to go through deep emotional hell  the likes of which havent been seen this year  if it hadnt been for an otherwise nottotallygreat final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary  when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety   id say this is one of the top ten best films of the year  its so close to perfection  in its structure  its treatment of its subject  and its beautiful technical specifications  cinematography nomination  without a shred of doubt in my mind  and maybe film editing   that its nearly a shame that its not the flawless gem that it should be  but  hey  as it is  i can hardly complain  
0	the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie  if you dont count neil simons biloxi blues   year after year  more predictably cliched military movies come out  most recently sgt  bilko  and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last  i thought stripes would be different  with ivan reitman as director  bill murray as star and harold ramis as costar and coscreenwriter  it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army  instead  it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army  murray  about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs  plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success  and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him  so he does  and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell  headshaving and marchingsinging sequences  more mindnumbingly stale here than ever  the characters are even less original  ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette  all the big name stars in stripes  and even larroquette  fall victim to the lame  rehashed material and are never really likeable  murray in particular  he only gets a few decent lines in  although those barelyfunny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters  he was even better in caddyshack  for crying out loud  as with a lot of the late 70s  early 80s comedies  stripes is a completely juvenile movie only a child would like but is so sex obsessed no child should be able to watch it  im sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over 400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women  but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition  dear god   every few seconds  stripes isnt the playful kind of sex comedy  either  most of the time it seems downright misogynistic  as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the womens showers or murray lifts a female m  p  onto the stove and  with an iknowwhatyoulike look on his face  says hes going to give her the  aunt jemima treatment   which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly  you dont want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region    im not enjoying this   the woman protests  my sentiments exactly  
1	when casting the key part of the voice of moses  most peoples first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer  the saint and the island of dr  moreau   but he was dreamworkss choice in their first traditionally animated movie  the prince of egypt  the selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one  but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasnt in the casting department  the radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic  a la cecil b  demille  to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones  in the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children  animated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies  now that is something fresh  let me admit upfront that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off  dreamworkss antz seemed to be a movie not quite appropriate for any age group  the prince of egypt may be harder to market than antz  but it is much more satisfying  like antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixars a bugs life  the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices  danny glover is the voice of jethro  jeff goldblum of aaron  steve martin of hotep  helen mirren of the queen  michelle pfeiffer of tzipporah  martin short of huy and patrick stewart of seti  you can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god  the movie  which is weakest in the story department  is a cliffs notes version of demilles the ten commandments  the script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in mosess life  demille took over three and a half hours in order to do it justice  at less than half of that  the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it doesnt establish sufficient depth for us to bond with the characters  we meet moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket  we watch him grow up and become best bud and a chariot racing partner to ramses  ralph fiennes   the future pharaoh  moses is a free spirit and a practical joker until he finds out his true identity as a jew     all ive ever known to be true is a lie   moses complains   after finding out his real identity  he sees for the first time the oppression of the jewish slaves that are all around him  after leaving egypt  moses comes back to ask ramses to let mosess people go  this leads to the classic scene of the parting of the red sea  which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally handdrawn animation of the most of the production  it is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling  drawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses  blues and golds  the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last  the construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust  and other scenes are shot with the glow of a rising sun  the most original visual sequence in the film occurs during a dream moses has  done with an explicit twodimensional look  the colorful images painted on the temple walls come to life to tell their own animated story  even though it has its weaknesses  the prince of egypt is a noble attempt to carve out a new genre  serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family  this aweinspiring movie deserves to be seen  the prince of egypt runs about 1  30  it is rated pg for thematic elements and would be fine for the whole family  how old a kid would need to be to be interested depends on the child  but those over 8 will probably like it  
0	  snake eyes  is the most aggravating kind of movie  the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing  its not just because this is a brian depalma film  and since hes a great director and one whos films are always greeted with at least some fanfare  and its not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance  this film is hardly worth his talents  its worse than that  its aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more  could be totally intelligent  and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely    then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of halfassedness  or more deservedly  the hall of fame of the eighthassedness  in certain circles   snake eyes  was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawas classic  rashomon   where a crime is told from the four different  and i mean different  perspectives  and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening  which  i might add  is superb  in one very very very long steadicam shot  we meet the protagonist  crooked atlantic city detective  rick santoro  cage   and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife  interupts a payperview event on tv  chases down a gambler  enters the arena all pumped up for the fight  sits down and talks with his bud  kevin dunne  gary sinise  whos character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn  whos also in this   and watches as it happens  theres a big name in the crowd  and thats the secretary of defense  charles kirkland  joel fabiani   whos sitting behind rick  and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion  lincoln tyler  stan shaw   is knocked out  this all happens in the opening shot  and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction  what really happened  this film asks  and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene    and discovers theres a very good possibility it was a conspiracy  as we follow rick trying to learn of more information  we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot  carla gugino   and who flees the scene in a panic  and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casinohotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness takes on what happened  this is all going pretty fine and dandy  and its extremely interesting to watch    then it takes one wrong step  we follow the wrong character  and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on  and way before rick can find it out  but thats not the worst part of it  its that its the one person you didnt think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring  the one you didnt think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it  it only gets worse  the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film  and since we already know what happened  we cant rely on ricks investigation to be all that interesting  its as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in  and decided to just fall back on an easy way out  and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible  events become more and more proposterous  and by the end  the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this  the deux ex machina  thats where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay  this time  its a hurricane  an outofcontrol police car  and a big round ball that adorned the arena  what went wrong  depalma and the screenwriter  david koepp  are extremely credible people in their respective fields  and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this  depalma  who idolizes hitchcock to death  has done many a film like this  such as his masterpiece   blow out   where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece  but granted  depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch  what with his overthetop shot setups  notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel  forgetting anything about boundaries  at least his direction makes up partly for it  then theres koepp  who showed such great ability at making a characters flaws come to life like he did in depalmas earlier  carlitos way   a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well  he can write a flawed character  but his rick santoro seems to be just a halfassed effort  hes flawed  and we can see redemption if the story wasnt so formulaic  a scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup  he may as well have said the opposite of what he says  it would have at least gone with what the character was like  this is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity  because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption  then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way  as i was watching the first half hour  i couldnt wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed  how many different perspectives hed be given  and perhaps hed have to make a choice between whos he has to believe  now theres a film  unfortunately  the film has two major deux ex machinas  one in the disasterous ending  the other  about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap weve seen all too much before  but never from someone like depalma

1	casting  doogie howser  star neil patrick harris as mindreading military intelligence is only one of the guilty pleasures of  starship troopers   a hugely entertaining  megabudgeted scifi yarn directed by paul verhoeven  whos making quite a recovery from his 1995 gstring epic  showgirls   sure   starship troopers  qualifies as cinematic junk food  but thats forgivable when the junk food is this tasty  everyone needs a highcalorie changeofpace from falls onslaught of costume dramas and other assorted oscar bait  and  troopers  does the job admirably despite its flaws  for its first hour   starship troopers  plays like a cheeky futuristic hybrid of  saved by the bell  and  g  i  jane   in the distant years ahead  high school grad johnny rico  casper van dien  signs up for federal service along with his girlfriend carmen  denise richards   he gets accepted into the mobile infantry but she wants to travel to the fleet academy to become a starship pilot  so the couple is broken up  but theres temptation awaiting both of them  johnnys is in the form of an old friend  dina meyer  also in the infantry and still harboring a secret crush  while carmen attracts the eye of her flirtatious instructor  patrick muldoon   personal rivalry and sexual jealousy carry over into the final 65 minutes  when an impending alien menace begins making good on its threatening presence and obliterates part of south america  killing johnnys parents and destroying his home  our weakening  lovesick protagonist is given new reasons to stick around the mobile infantry  and is dispatched with a group of fellow fighters to the aliens home planet  where he will head up a ground assault to end the threat for good  but the enemy is far smarter  more diabolical and numerous than the good guys give them credit for  and after an initial walloping  they must reexamine their strategy  the exposition  played like a futuristic soap opera  is silly  but aware of its own ridiculousness enough to merit more smiles than groans  once we get past the campy character introductions and the numerous  but never boring  training sessions   starship troopers  really kicks into high gear  its last half is all gruesomely violent action  a fury of severed limbs  decapitations  disembowelments  brain removal  explosions and other joltinducers that are really going to please the 13 and 14yearold boys lucky enough to dodge getting carded or caught on their way into this deservedly rrated show  the creature design and special effects are amazing as expected  and their interaction with the human actors are a realistic  imaginative high point  its nice to see intergalactic beasties that arent too derivative of the titular menace from  alien   these monsters are appropriately terrifying sights  especially the arachnids  a spiderscorpioncrab combo thats all sharp talons and even sharper legs  they attack in packs of hundreds  and its a funny  scary sight to see these bugs take repeated hits and still crawl  jerk and struggle towards their intended victims in a determined  gooey mess  it matters not that they actually have a laughable master plan in mind  ask yourself if a species like this seems capable of carrying out such a plot   these sequences of insect warfare are numerous  bloody and immensely satisfying  the occasional dramatic moments  one cast members death  the final resolution to johnnys love triangle  are botched  a testament to how  starship troopers  fails to create any strong  outstanding characters  these bland kenandbarbie archetypes serve the story adequately enough to keep any distractions at arms length  but restrain the film from achieving a higher ground a la  star wars   where even the slightest aliens had definite personality  the acting is decent  but never spectacular   most of the performers hail from aaron spelling territory  smallish roles on  beverly hills 90210  andor  melrose place   and it occasionally shows  van dien  for example  is limited but perfectly likeable  in smaller parts are the aforementioned neil patrick harris as johnnys best friend and jake busey  garys son  as johnnys sidekick  the latter excels at playing creeps  see  the frighteners  or  contact   but seems offkilter as a second banana    starship troopers  is based on the novel by robert heinlein  a scifi writer who hasnt exactly seen any recent adaptation justice done to any of his books what with 1994s howler  the puppet masters   but the overall familiarity to the  alien  trilogy  and the promise of great gobs of gore  could act as a crowddrawer  its own possible influence  however  might well work against it when the franchise continuation  alien  resurrection  opens in a few weeks  we will know then which film to crown as the best summer movie of the fall  
0	i suppose its unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk  which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since its 1991 release  michael lehmanns actioncomedy was quick to win the title biggest box office flop of all time  or close thereof  the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk  whos just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation  let me put it this way   he explains  i never saw et   greeting him is his old friend and partner in crime  played by danny aiello   who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes  these are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags  cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences  it appears as if director lehmann didnt know when to stop all the absurd silliness  and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line  if at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldnt get goofier  youll soon be eating your words  but  im inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as its box office numbers suggest  its fastpaced and entertaining  if youve got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor  for the first portion of this review  im going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk  wish me luck  first and foremost  bruce willis is a good sport  while im not entirely sure what he was smoking when he cowrote this script  willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big  fat  ugly joke  he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and outofplace  which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions  another plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character  they meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican  and their relationship escalates in interest from there  its unfortunate that mcdowells onenote character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plottwist  and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis  but now im rambling on again about the negative things  arent i  enough of the charade  for the most part  hudson hawk is an excruciating experience  its stupid  pointless and repetitive  i can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater  because this film really doesnt have the potential to please anyone  action fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90 comedy  and even the action sequences are skittery  rushed and poorly edited  and those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headacheinducing hijinks  dont get me wrong  this film is not devoid of laughs  its too bad most of them are unintentional  or just plain forced  the impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed  its understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber  but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn im not entirely sure  coburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play  and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie  especially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown  and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film  things get more bizarre when were introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars  including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless  cardflipping kitkat  if thats not enough for you  theres richard e  grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover  their crotchbiting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here  wait  maybe the only big laughs    im not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk  i cant even begin to start about the films absurd plot  but lets not get into that  i suppose theres some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise  if they were that desperate  but hudson hawk never even has a clue of where its going from minute one  and from there its 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck  
0	once upon a time jeanclaude van damme was a decent action hero  the muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films  boasting his spectacular martialarts ability  some of these excursions were fun  but now it seems like watching a van damme movie has become a painful chore  with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mindnumbing action  and when the action goes sour  what is there left to enjoy  ill explain  knock off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong  marcus ray  van damme   a babemagnet and stylish dresser  heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner  rob schneider   they become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans  seemingly by a mole in the business  im going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph  so if you want a review devoid of spoilers  skip onto the next one  im not quite sure who gives a crap  but ill issue a warning anyhow  tommy is really working with the cia  his boss  a very hammy and flat paul sorvino  is the mole  and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons  he even stoops so low to put them into childrens toys  if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing  then you probably will enjoy knock off  if you think that this ridiculous setup couldnt even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing  this might not be your cup of tea  knock off sucks  it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares  it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something  simply because van damme is the star  the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind  the performances are so wooden you could use them to row a canoe  and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe  director tsui hark  who teamed with van damme in the superior  but still lamebrained double team  is at the helm  and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot  i suppose i enjoyed some of the camera work  but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous  the picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence  speeds are altered consistently  and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired  it all sounds very cool  trust me  it isnt  as much as it scars me to say this  har  har   van damme is terrible  sure  he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease  he looks like hes doing a bad impersonation of jackie chan  and his performance is stiff and tired  i hate to say it  but perhaps its time for mr  van damme to give up his day job  its really a test of endurance watching knock off  i suppose theres some enjoyment derived from schneiders character  who is extremely annoying  but provides the films better moments  and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie  hopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter  knock off doesnt even stand strong as a mindless but entertaining action film  like a handful of van dammes others  no  this movie is an embarrassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking  and considering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department  that is certainly not saying much  note to self  avoid universal soldier 2  the return upon release in august  99  
1	even if i did not know that director and cowriters james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the xfiles  i would have inevitably made a connection  the similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon like plot  to the mysterious characters  to the overall dark  ominous settings  it would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case  they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis  in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie   another more important similarity  is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time  this is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie  especially when compared to some of the trash  of the same genre  released in the last couple of years  urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch   what helps final destination is its unique premise  unlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders  the villain presented is unusual  its the grim reaper  this being already has predestined when and how you will die  according to the brief history lesson given in this film  everyone was meant to die at a certain time  some people at 100  others at 17  whatever death chooses  what is unique about death is that its already dead  so you cant really kill it  the only way to defeat death is to cheat it  the question is how do you do that  this dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers  alex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash  leaving no survivors  alex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off  shortly after  the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal  however  death isnt through with them yet  it gradually kills off the seven one by one  leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again  the plot allows for some of the most creative  original death scenes i have seen in a while  some scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax  others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock  creativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films  sure  it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders  ali larters character is particularly annoying   but the shocks  from the beginning to the end  are extremely entertaining  also director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously  he knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that wont win any academy awards  not even a golden globe   the myriad of inside jokes and gags  the characters are named after famous horror directors  one character who plays a jerk is named carter  like xfiles creator chris carter  and a song by john denver  who died in a plane crash  plays whenever death is near  show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie  and from this  i had a great time watching the movie  
1	steven spielbergs second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film  spielberg  ever the student on film  has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest  and most powerful entries  he also managed to cast this eras greatest answer to jimmy stewart  tom hanks  who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle  for about 160 out of its 170 minutes   saving private ryan  is flawless  literally  the plot is simple enough  after the epic dday invasion  whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular   capt  john miller  hanks  and his team are forced to search for a pvt  james ryan  damon   whose brothers have all died in battle  once they find him  they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home  accompanying miller are his crew  played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational  barry pepper  adam goldberg  vin diesel  giovanni ribisi  davies  and burns are the team sent to find one man  and bring him home  the battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary  literally  there is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the films first 20 minutes  spielberg films almost the entire movie without music  leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion  and they do to perfection  the sequences in france  all of them  beginning with the battle and ending with the battle  are fabulous  especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides  trying to save private ryan  there are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences  this is what coppola was looking for in  apocalypse now   but couldnt create  the sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war  the performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary  he is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world  with his comic timing  dramatic flair  his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears  hanks is this countrys finest actor  and he proves it here  however  spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece  with a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time  spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film  the sequence involving army chiefofstafff george marshall and mrs  ryan is decent  but doesnt hold up to the rest of the film  relying on wartime cliches to power it  but that is forgivable  what isnt is the bookends of the film  the cemetary sequences  the first one is quite good  a decent introduction into the lives of these men  the last sequence is atrocious  the forced emotion  accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music  is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film  these flaws are what downgrade  ryan  from the greatest film of our era  to the greatest war film of our era  spielberg should have trusted his own material  and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie  to end his masterpiece right there  the use of the flag  though patriotic  is in contrast to the movies theme  the power of the bulk of the film  however  is astonishing  spielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art  that persists even after first viewing of the film  is extraordinary  this is the film of the year  
1	vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element  substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject  but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents  and  unlike any of the more outlandish myths  the vampire holds some realworld probability  one study claims 1  000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide  and places 50 in los angeles   but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys  john carpenter would like to remind us that they are  and always have been  a truly frightening element of the thriller genre  and remind us he does in his latest film  vampires  there was some question  as halloween weekend approached  of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinemas immensely successful blade  released in august  the two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue  and dont even agree on some basic points of the slaying method    for instance  blades main weapons are silver and garlic  whereas main character jack crows technique is a wooden stake to the heart   blade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization  while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate  both have their advantages  and here  carpenters style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered  when its all said and done  though  the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish  the level for gore is indeed set to maximum  this time  our hero is vaticansponsored slayer jack crow  james woods   hes a cynical  battleworn veteran  and the best of his bunch  he and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest  and after exterminating a nest one night  they run up against a supervampire  termed a  master   named valek  thomas ian griffith   valek kills all of jacks team except for his partner  tony montoya  daniel baldwin   and as the two regroup  they learn that valek is the original vampire  now over six hundred years old  apparently  valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of a cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime  so with the aid of a priest named adam  tim guinee  and a bitten hooker  sheryl lee  as bait  they track valek down for the final confrontation  the script for vampires  written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel  is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year  crow  in particular  is a fun source of oneliners  and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism  baldwin  lee  and guinee are all fine supports  adding to the character pool  but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffiths bad guy  griffiths intense expression is perfect for the role  and the only downside is that hes got to talk sometime  luckily  hes got few lines  and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance  all said  fans will surely be impressed by this picture  and those who found apt pupil a bit limp will be excited by this one  certainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters  
1	it is often said by his fans that hal hartley movies are an acquired taste  indeed  while perhaps less dangerous than tequila shooters or bungeejumping  they require no less amount of physical stamina and concentration  i felt rewarded at the end of henry fool  this movie creeps up on youat a slow 139 minutes  i mean creepsand despite the final shots ambiguity  i left completely satisfied  henry fool   used to have an  e   arrives at garbageman simon grims house  claims the vacant basement apartment  and almost instantly inspires simon  urbaniak  to take up writinghenry  martin donovan lookalike ryan  is an exconvict  a oncegreat author who has been  exiled and marginalized  by the publishing community because of his criminal activity  simons poetry turns him into a local sensation  as it causes mute women to sing  highschool girls to swoon  and councilmen to rile against its  pornographic  content  meanwhile  henry seduces both simons dependent mother  porter  and immature sister  sundance queen posey  with philosophical babble  which is by turns brilliant and inane  and breathy animal lust  these story elements result in climaxes both inevitable and unpredictable  the teacherstudent relationship formed between henry and simon eventually reverses itself  henry fool is sprinkled with hartleyian flourishes  simon drinks milk from  udderleys   the big teen hangout is called  world of donuts   simon wears his garbagemans uniform throughout  the editing style is decidedly elliptical      which is key to the conclusions said ambiguity   the performances by the three leads are abrasive at first  selfconsciously  quirky   the introductory scenes are a chore  these people do grow on you because they convey genuine passion  a belief in themselves  and because they have longterm goals  henry and simon may drink a lot of budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner  but they arent pop slackers  the story is rather classical  the tutor is a better talker than a doer  raised on books  the timid tutee has innate talent his master only dreams of    shades of film school     the finished film is epic in its proportions for a story so small  and the final third does test ones patience  yet henry fool is tight  hardly excessive in its length  how refreshing to see a movie this long in 1998 devoted entirely to character  and unless i nodded off  not a single building exploded  this  hartleys seventh feature  is contemplative about  the artist   fortunately  we never get a sampling of simons work  and its a testament to the actors and the screenplay that by the end we can surmise what sort of thoughts would pour from these writers pens  
1	what is a scary movie anyhow  is it a movie where a person gets ripped to shreds  is it where a person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge  possibly its some guy with a hook who wants to know what you did last summer  what ever happened to horror movies  where the horror was in the atmosphere  and in the characters  movies like  halloween  and  psycho  which revolutionized horror genre forever  but wait in 1973 came a movie based on the bestselling book by william peter blatty  entitled  the exorcist   the movie opened to rave reviews  and scared audiences to death  now in the year 2000  the exorcist  comes back to the big screen in a version youve never seen complete with six channel digital surround sound  and fifteen minutes of new footage never before seen as long as a new ending  chris mcniell is an actress living in georgetown washington with her twelve year old daughter regan  while working on a new film  chris still stays close to regan  but starts to wonder why her bed shakes at night  and why regan starts to have convulsions all of a sudden  when chris finds out that regan is possessed by a demon  she shuns at the fact of it  but considers getting a priest to help her daughter  father karras  jason miller  is the man they bring in  his mother has just died  and still in mourning he decides to help this little girl  christ  father karras  and their nanny sharon  kitty winn  have to sit and wait until a man shows up  that man is the exorcist  and that man will help this little girl  excrutiatingly scary  the exorcist is a classic horror film  which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half to death  now we get to the experience  the exorcist  the way it was meant to be seen in a directors cut which incorpates fifteen minutes of new footage cut by friedkin at the time of the release for content and time  a new ending has been added as well  and adds more of a lighter feeling to the movie  which i prefer the original darker ending more  the movie has also been remastered in a wonderful six channel digital sound mix  and is amazing  the voices are all clear  the music pours out on you and engulfs you in richness  as a director friedkin has been well known for other films  but his standout film is  the exorcist  nominated for several academy awards it one a few  but was somehow doubted best picture  best actress  ellen burstyn  and best supporting actress  linda blair  who at the age of i believe thirteen does a wonderful job of being a little girl  alone  possessed and unable to stop what is going on  ellen burstyn i think gives her best performance to date  and can be seen currently in  requiem for a dream  to which she is getting rave reviews for  jason miller  jason patriks dad  is amazing as father karras  and his performance will be forever embedded in my mind  to me he is the character who makes the entire film float along  i was saddened when i saw this film with an audience of mostly younger people to see them laughing at this movie  i in no way  think that this movie is comical  yes some of the stuff regan says is funny  but they were laughing at her head spinning  and the green pea soup  come on people this is some creepy stuff  anyway the rerelease of the film has managed to make 40 million dollars  and is still going  hopefully one day they rerelease it again in twenty years for more generations to come to enjoy

1	youve got mail works alot better than it deserves to  in order to make the film a success  all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars  have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits  no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in its body  its basically a complete reshoot of the shop around the corner  only adding a few modern twists   essentially  it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking  its overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy  not to mention very manipulative  but oh  how enjoyable that manipulation is  but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does  because i absolutely hated the previous ryanhanks teaming  sleepless in seattle  it couldnt have been the directing  because both films were helmed by the same woman  i havent quite yet figured out what i liked so much about youve got mail  but then again  is that really important  if you like something so much  why even question it  again  the storyline is as cliched as they come  tom hanks plays joe fox  the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley  the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a familyrun childrens book shop called  in a nice homage  the shop around the corner  fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business  little do they know  they are already in love with each other over the internet  only neither party knows the other persons true identity  the rest of the story isnt important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen  sure  there are some mildly interesting subplots  but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship  all of this  of course  leads up to the predictable climax  but as foreseeable as the ending is  its so damn cute and welldone that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does  when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love  i was filled with such  for lack of a better word  happiness that for the first time all year  i actually left the theater smiling  
1	near the end of 1996  analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king  the following year  1997  saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom  twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia  at best  thats all it was  a sleeper hit  designed to surprise but not shake the industry  in 1998  however  things have been decidedly different  there have been a number of pushes on disneys death grip on the market  and fiftyone weeks into 98  a new champion has emerged  dreamworks the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed  the other two contenders  warner brothers quest for camelot and disneys own annual entry  mulan  lacked inspiration and drive respectively  although camelot was borderlineabysmal  and cant really be considered a shot at the title  mulan had the makings of winner  unfortunately  it was saturated with traditional  disneycute animation  and lost points against the rapidlychanging face of the competition  in making the prince of egypt  dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product  the animation is flawless  and  aside from a bugs life  is the bestlooking movie to date  the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects  and the 2d3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with  the key to success  however  was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot  namely  some of the most important action sequences  like the parting of the red sea  were done almost entirely in 3d  dreamworks is the first studio to prove that theyve got the stuff of success  and that theyre capable of challenging disney  the story is also wellwritten  and the characters voiced with talent  for the most part  the plot follows its source material  the book of exodus  although only in the most general sense  the writers took a few creative liberties  and most do not damage the story in any way  in fact  the shakespearean relationship between moses  val kilmer  and the pharaoh rameses  ralph fiennes  makes the story more interesting if anything  moses  a hebrew  is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile  he floats into the pharaoh seti  patrick stewart  s palace and is taken in by the royal family  moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert  where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves  by this time  rameses is now pharaoh  and the two brothers  now on opposite sides of the line  face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention  the cast of voices is most impressive  and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock  jeff goldblum  danny glover  and steve martin  the script does not have a lot of oneliners in it  and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams  but overall the story is exciting and interesting  its decidedly for an older crowd  and the tykes who havent had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost  but for those who make the bid  the prince of egypt can be a great watch

0	for a film touted as exploring relationships and black sexuality  trois is surprisingly tame  despite its lurid subject matter and its passing nod to fatal attraction  it moves along with flat  uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film  freshly moved to atlanta  jermaine  dourdan  and his wife  jasmine  moore   have the trappings of a perfect life  they have a beautiful house in suburbia  jermaine is a lawyer on the fast track at his firm  jasmine is his supportive wife  who is finishing up her college degree  in an opening montage via a home video of the pair  we see the unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs  this is a couple that has it all  into this eden slithers the lure of lust  despite his outward appearance  jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as a possession than a person  a glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he goes about his business  oblivious to jasmines concerns  we also find that he has been relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in a menage atrois  much to jasmines dismay  as jermaine puts it   dont you want to be sexually free   jermaine shares his desire with coworker terrence  smith   who obligingly sets jermaine up with a woman who might be interested in just such an encounter  the woman  jade  palmer  is a direct counterpoint to jasmine  jade  at one point was a college student  too  unlike jasmine  she found herself pregnant  dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet  to further reinforce their differences  its revealed that jade is involved in a custody battle over her son  inevitably  through liquor and a touch of duplicity on jermaines part  the forbidden act is consummated  the aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon jermaines property with the hint that the violence may escalate  by this point  trois shows itself to be a soap opera without the requisite melodrama  a fatal attraction without the social significance  the exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and stereotypical  jermaine comes off as insincere  sexually driven and selfish  jasmine is bland and subservient  jade comes off a bit sympathetically  but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy  yet another tale of a sexually aggressive  dog  of a man who imposes his will upon his accommodating  innocent mate  the last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you a curve  but by this point  will you even care  if the rest of the movie was as dynamic as the ending  perhaps there could have been some freshness to it  as it stands  trois is pretty standard fare  
0	when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions  i turned to my friend and said   dangerous liaisons for kids   it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense  owing everything it is to stephen frears 1988 masterpiece  imagine my surprise to see that writerdirector roger kumble has given credit to his source material  choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits  and i was impressed  in fact  i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film  which is an appalling excuse for a movie  its kiddieporn hackwork  complete with earthy sextalk and fullyclothed handjobs  i suppose this kind of movie was inevitable  with all the teen highschool angst movies coming out  there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think theyre smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined  cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way  and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to  i hated all the characters  and i hate everything they do  i also hate ryan phillippe  so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be  phillippe plays  check out this name  sebastian valmont  wow  isnt that a memorable name  i could just say it over and over again  sebastian valmont  it kind of rolls off the tongue  in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich  sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth  there is no woman he cant have  no material object out of his reach  he has all the money  all the sex  all at his fingertips  and  luckily  his parents never enter into his life  no  in the world of cruel intentions  adults dont really exist  the ones who do are irritating  sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister  kathryn merteuil  sarah michelle gellar   the bitchqueen of the universe  and also the woman every man wants  since these two rich kids are so bored  they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons  kathryn wants sebastian valmont to devirginize cecile caldwell  selma blair   a naive dorkchick who has somehow wronged kathryn  but its too easy for sebastian valmont  he wants to nail annette hargrove  reese witherspoon   the  paradigm of chastity and beauty   so  sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal  which is too explicit to state here   but  dear god   sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove  dangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable  and because of its masterful acting  cruel intentions is bad for many reasons  but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting  kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch  a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her  she is supposed to be mean  but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons  gellar  while aesthetically pleasing  is onedimensional and utterly repulsive  witherspoon has a truly beautiful face  but her character isnt the moral staple shes supposed to be  sure  she wont have sex until shes in love  is this really a  moral  issue    but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible  but i cant forget mr  phillippe  who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable  invulnerable blandness  i have to give him credit and say that he did  in fact  manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions  and theres one point in the film in which he shouts  thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone  true  he is bad  but it doesnt help that he has no character to work with  kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character  leaving us with a sexcrazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch  the film fails in every other way  too  first of all  nobody talks like this  even the  intellectuals  i know dont bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering  for a while  the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs  but it ends up taking itself so seriously that theres no way we can join it  cruel intentions also manages to come off as softporn in more than one scene  earlier i mentioned a fullyclothed handjob  this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont  both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie  so  if we hate them  then whats the point of an extended sex scene  titillation  of course  it cant even work under the pretense of  meaningful love scene   because we hate the characters  its interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons  kumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film  many of the scenes have a similar tone  and there are moments in frears film that kumble imitates almost completely  such as the last scene  in which spoiler warning   the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers   but kids dont act like this  nobody acts like this  in his translation  roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy  some pretty crucial elements  the result is a picture of confounding badness  a kiddieporn mess that thinks its really deep and profound  ill give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences  but that doesnt change the fact that its awful  
0	  the beach  is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder  every forty minutes of this twohour film begins with a new theme  virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act  it starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment  but then in the second act  the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of  blue lagoon   forty minutes later  the mood changes once more  and it becomes a dumbed down version of  lord of the flies  where an isolated community is discovered  where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs  by the time its over  you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about  the main character of  the beach  is angstridden richard  leonardo dicaprio   he travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if youre looking for a good time  richards voiceover tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown  this seedy environment is just what richard is looking for  he checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy  robert carlisle   he seems like a raving lunatic  obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis  though his jagged behavior would distress most of us  richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen  moreover  the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life  captivated by the idea  he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey  they are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise  who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richards  once they finally arrive at this paradise  however  the mood of the story shifts to richards growing desire for francoise  this particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard  etienne is about as exciting as fluffy  white sand  its odd that etienne never sees this coming  but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view  and once the three stumble across the hidden community  mood shift imminent   more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers  for example  there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards  and the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark  there are several ideas that are introduced in  the beach  and each one could merit its own featurelength film  theres the man vs  nature angle  the love triangle angle  and the utopiagoneawry angle  but the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred  dicaprio  as a result  has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through  consequently  the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up  
1	i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory  this was  of course  a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this  not only did i get to see an advance screening  i was able to see an advance screening of a  very good  movie  the very fastpaced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher  a fasttalking  witty  comical taxi driver in new york city  gibsons performance is terrific  and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films  gibson again teams up with richard donner  as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick  and this time around  the combination works even better  the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique  try to imagine a toneddowned version of travis bickle who  this time around  is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy coverups  if you can imagine that  then youve basically got jerry fletcher  in many ways  i was surprised by this movie  to begin with  i was surprised at how good it was  dont get me wrong  its not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring  but it was a very enjoyable movie  secondly  i was surprised at mel gibsons performance  he provided a fantastic performance  the previews of this film led me to believe it was an allout action flick  which after viewing  it was almost the opposite in a certain sense  gibsons character has an almost uncountable number of oneliners  hilarious situations  and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film  for instance  jerrys apartment  and especially his security  is memorable  and last  i was surprised at how good the plot is  writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story  and when watching this film  you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletchers farfetched  or so they seem at first  conspiracy theories are helgelands own opinions  mel gibson isnt the only standout in the film  julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton  the department of justice employee who cant seem to stay away from jerry fletcher  who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories  he also seems obsessed and in love with her  but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories  she shrugs him and his beliefs off  continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him  jerry  obviously determined to continually seek out the truth  continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory  which will be printed in his newsletter  same title as the movie   although he only has five subscribers  he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work  and publishes his next edition  very soon after he does so  he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr  jonas  patrick stewart   after barely escaping alive  jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust  alice sutton  the remainder of the film is almost always fastpaced and full of action and suspense  with jerrys life being constantly put into jeopardy  and more along the way  the audience  and alice  learn more and more about jerrys life  many things are explained throughout this film  both to the characters and to the audience  for instance  the meaning of the book  the catcher in the rye  and its ties to assassins  the reason lone gunmen have three names  e  g  lee harvey oswald and james earl ray   and the real truth behind the grateful dead  make sure listen closely throughout the film  as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above  definitely  when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th  make sure you are standing in line to see it  i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film  especially if you are into an actionthriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations  and even if you arent  you should still like this film  
1	until i saw the night of the hunter  it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie  forget the others and the deep end  which veered toward strained dramatics   the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie ive seen so far this year  even though the movie is nearly 50 years old and theres a not drop of blood to be seen  luckily  the night of the hunter  charles laughtons first and final directing gig  has been restored by the ucla film and television archive and is being rereleased in october 2001  so  theres still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place  robert mitchum stars as harry powell  a reverend with a nasty habit of courting and then killing widows for their cash  his newest target is young mother willa harper  shelley winters   whose murderer husband ben  peter graves  has hidden 10  000 somewhere  powell finds out about the stash and decides to court mrs  harper after hes released and ben is hanged  but finding the money isnt easy for powell  who must contend with his stepchildren  billy chapin and sally jane bruce   who know where the money is  but arent telling  the hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn and quartered and then flaunted all the memorable moments  thus ruining the spontaneity and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time  how many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in psycho have we seen in other movies  what about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin    no  im not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem   yes  there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night of the hunter  powells  love  and  hate  knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing  remember radio raheem    and powells black suit  with black tie and white shirt  could have shaped quentin tarantinos early visual style  seeing the night of the hunter for the first time  i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit and fright and how much intensity was intact  you can now sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club  he plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears  hes like the senior class president with an evil streak  if i ever need to stay awake  ill just picture him crooning   leaning    leaning      any actor who wants to play a character with a touch of evil should study his performance the way a rabbinical student studies the torah  and credit must be handed out to laughton and cinematographer stanley cortez  who create a series of haunting  surreal shadowy images over the rural depressionera backdrop  its a testament to both men that theyre able to invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline  kids harassed by evil guardians  by sticking to the old maxim that were more scared by what we dont see  screenwriter and legendary film critic james agee does a beautiful job giving shape and substance to an array of supporting characters  the drunk birdie  james gleason  whos haunted by his wife  and the spoons  evelyn varden and walt spoon  whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act  the only lapse is the movies third act  when pearl and john run away from home and find a home with the motherly  biblereading mrs  cooper  lillian gish   her showdown with powell is memorable  a battle done with dueling hymns  however  the whole segment feels a little rushed and underdone  but its still a thrill seeing the queen of the silent film era handling a shotgun  do yourself favor and dont miss this if it comes to a nearby theater  note  a series of revealing  but overlong  outtakes preceded the movie  the highlights included the legendary laughton  who sounds eerily like mr  pitt from seinfeld  running winters lines with mitchum  and the adorable  tiny bruce having trouble descending a coal pile  hours more of such footage exists  as laughton liked to keep the cameras constantly rolling  screened as part of the 2001 new york film festival retrospectives  feature story coming soon   
1	making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed  especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece  when it comes to living up to expectations  a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure  for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the originals greatness is very rare indeed  and whereas  babe  pig in the city  misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe  it is a worthy companion piece  more than that  it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right    babe  pig in the city  warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like  the godfather  part ii  and  the empire strikes back  as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced    babe  pig in the city  picks up precisely where  babe  left off  having won the sheep herding competition  farmer hoggett  james cromwell  and his pig are elevated to fame status  a series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs  hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city  in doing so  the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original    babe  pig in the city  flourishes where so many sequels fail  most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film  not  babe  pig in the city   this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first  also  by not being content to utilize most of the old characters  this film gives us many new ones to enjoy  in essence  it doesnt attempt to copy itself  instead  it strives to achieve an originality of its own  and it succeeds  thats not to say the familiar is absent    babe  pig in the city  retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film  along with babe himself  ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride  as does mrs  hoggett  one of this decades best and most underappreciated comic characterizations  hilariously performed by magda szubanski   the three singing mice also make the journey  chiming in with their cute highpitched vocals  the story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice  from there  we are guided once again by roscoe lee brownes soothingly deep narrative  composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these  but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting  while staying at the flealands hotel  babe encounters a veritable arkfull of new animals  monkeys  kittens  and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new  urbanites  that babe befriends  as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter  each character is distinctly unique  some of which are imbued with personal humanlike struggles that are endearing and touching  and while this world focuses largely on these animals  we are introduced to two new human characters as well  mary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel  an animalloving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors  steins landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature  we also meet fugly floom  an old softspoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel  utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions  not having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film  it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was  so as not to ruin this wellkept secret  i wont reveal the actors identity here  it was a treat indeed to see one of cinemas legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance  the greatest triumph of  babe  pig in the city  is the art direction  simply putit bleeds creativity  taking the look of the original film to a whole new level  restricted primarily to a farm the first time around  this second installment creates an entire city  dazzling us with unique fablelike architecture  but the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our worlds architectural landmarks  designing a skyline that includes the statue of liberty  the sydney opera house  the brooklyn bridge  the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower  ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities  as seen in the film photo and preproduction drawing to your right   added to that  many of this citys streets are the twin siblings of venices gondolatrekked rivers  the metropolis that has sprung from fords vision is a wondrous sight to behold  it is a world that you want to walk around in  norma moriceaus costume designs belong in this world  vibrant in color and style equal to that of the fords landscape  most of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish  with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly flooms clown outfit  andrew lesnies photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the films multiple emotional tones  much press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of  babe  pig in the city   reports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg13 rating  these reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating  but even so  to be anything harsher than the original s g rating had many parents and fans up in arms  by deleting a minimal number of shots   babe  pig in the city  was eventually given the coveted g rating  although appeased  many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark  fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself  well  to coin a phrase  the reports of  babe  pig in the city  s death at the hands of a dark  scary  felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated  granted it has its moments of pseudomorbidity  but allinall  babe  pig in the city  is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be  whatever  dark  moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller  the  mad max  trilogy   the witches of eastwick    lorenzos oil    having served as a producer and cowriter on the first film  miller moves into the directors chair for this one  putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise  the story of  babe  pig in the city  is an enchanting yarn  but one that doesnt achieve the emotional or character depth of the original  missing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity  an individuals worth  challenging conformity  and ones purpose in life    babe  dealt with this weighty subject matter  creating a timeless fable    babe  pig in the city  should not have rehashed these themes  but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones  this film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife  class differences  sacrificial courage  and so on  but this films goals arent as lofty as the firsts  instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach  allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting  sometimes intense  fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive    babe  pig in the city  also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film  specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe  hoggetts love for babe  which grew ever so gently  is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality  best exemplified in hoggetts dance for babe  this moving relationship was truly unique  it is something that i wish would have been present again  and could have through fugly floom   but was not  please understand  these are not negative criticisms  per se  but simply statements of what i see as the differences between  babe  pig in the city  being a very good film and the original being a great one  but having said that  these observations are minor critiques at best  as an overall piece   babe  pig in the city  is a thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end  sure  it isnt a great film  but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness  it is a film that is magical with its charm and humor  exciting in its adventurous exploits  funny with its dry wit and cute voices  and breathtaking in its presentation    babe  pig in the city  may not be moviemaking at its absolute best  but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema  as a result  if you choose to let this film pass you by  you will be missing of the years best cinematic treats  
0	heres something to chew on  whats the favorite food of big  cheesylooking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising  the obvious answer to this question is cardboard  because thats the depth of the most fully developed character in this painfully generic creature feature  deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer  in fact  considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas  perhaps it was  the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore  not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh  both human and nonhuman  been scattered in all directions  we learn some bloody trivia  as well  such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red  it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains  and what it does with halfdigested leftovers  i suppose deep risings gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre  but it doesnt do much for me  on the surface  and thats about the only level at which this film can be analyzed  deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic  everyone else is citing the equally valid alienstitanic connection  since james cameron directed both   in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongueincheek mayhem of tremors  deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin  the film is not humorous  tense  or exciting  in fact  its downright boring  and  despite being half the length of camerons current boxoffice champ  deep rising feels like the longer movie  is it really necessary to say anything about the plot  probably not  since its easy to guess  but ill go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis  the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship  in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics  theres finnegan  treat williams   the boats pilot  whos supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff  joey  kevin j  oconnor   the inept sidekick whos supposed to be lovable and funny  but is really just irritating   and hanover  wes studi   the  mastermind   and i use that term lightly  of the operation  their goal  attack a cruise ship  clean out the safe  then sink it using some illegallyacquired torpedoes  the problem is  by the time they reach the argonautica  the titaniclike luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste  aside from a beautiful jewel thief  famke janssen  and a couple of crew members  theres no one on board  the reason soon becomes obvious  the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles  the cast  which is led by treat williams  is primarily comprised of hasbeens and probablyneverwillbes  two exceptions  wes studi  best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans  and djimon hounsou  amistads cinque   williams  once a  cant miss  prospect in hollywood  has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising  and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career  famke janssen  who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye  is the perfect bland match for williams  given her limited acting abilities  its likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes  unfortunately  a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet teeshirt for half of the picture  meanwhile  kevin j  oconnor  who has entirely too much screen time  exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard  these days  audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computergenerated special effects  this is a lesson that writerdirector stephen sommers  who previously helmed the liveaction jungle book  needs to learn  the days of jurassic park  when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen  are past  now  moviegoers are looking for the sophistication of titanic  visuals that are so wellincorporated that its impossible to tell where they end and where  reality  begins  in deep rising  the monster  like everything  is artificial and unconvincing  unfortunately  the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isnt so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture  but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre  although  to be fair  deep rising is a particularly bad entry   even once this film has sunk out of sight  the knowledgeable viewer knows it wont be the last of its kind  like the slimy  slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies  more are waiting just around the corner in ambush  and that consideration  unlike anything on screen  is truly horrifying  
1	alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters  i saw it when i was 13 years old  and i must admit that i didnt like it  of course  i was expecting aliens again  and i believe this was my fault  in order to appreciate alien 3  you need to see aliens  but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor  james camerons aliens was an action film  and many people consider it the best in the series  i am among that group  but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film  which critics have bashed for its originality  many thought the final chase scene went on for too long  and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action  both are untrue  because the film has quite a bit of action  and the dialogue was essential and wellwritten  as for the chase sequence  it was long  but not overly long  creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion  perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped  on the big screen  i was overwhelmed by something i normally didnt see  it was a very dark film  and the language was extremely harsh  i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities  dont get me wrongim not saying films should eliminate swearing  but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks  it gets rather distracting  however  since seeing it again  i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters  as a result  alien 3s only flaw  albeit a major one  is the underdeveloped characters  we never really care about any of them  and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie  there were only two characters i liked  and of course one was lt  ripley  sigourney weaver   although we have gotten to know her through two other films  the other character was dr  clemens  charles dance   but because we like him  the inevitable occurs  alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off  the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher  who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry  without using a single line of dialogue  unless you count computer warnings   fincher sets up the entire film  an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card  we see lt  ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments      title     a shot of an alien egg      title     alien legs stretch up into the air      title     and so on and so on  during these first ten minutes  i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed  its quite a remarkable opening  and one which will remain in my mind for a long time  because of this facehugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens  the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod  and sent down to the nearest planet  fiorina fury161  an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison  however  the facehugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryotubes  and is sent down with the escape pod  unfortunately  during the landing  all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed  ripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery  of course  you need a carrier for this facehugger  and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates  ripley is revived and asks to see the ship  after seeing a mysterious acideaten section  ripley asks to see the dead bodies  and then have them cremated  this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films  featuring a monologue from dillon  charles s  dutton   a prisoner who has found god  the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dogs demise  its one of the most memorable moments  as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog  and this is where alien 3 succeeds  fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films  and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock  in fact  he is the mixture of both   fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it  and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films  alien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images  by doing so  fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise  many people have criticized finchers filming of the death scene of ripley  i reveal nothing by saying this  as looking too fake  but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal  showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch  but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron  a great deal of symbolism is derived  i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron  however  most people seem to want to witness ripley die  which creates a paradox  as she is the character i didnt want to see die   why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film  and i dont plan on spoiling that in this review  from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever  in alien  it was  of course  the moment the alien burst out of kanes stomach  in aliens  it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine  alien 3 has several  but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley  ripley is pushed up against a wall  and the alien stands inches away from her  why it doesnt kill her is a shocker  which later leads to a surprise ending  fincher apparently loves to use closeups of actors faces  michael douglas and the clown faceoff in the game in the same style   and by shaving off the actors hair  the only thing we have to look at is their faces  many critics didnt like all the actors being bald  but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot  most of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story  but when you try to compare it to its predecessors  finchers turn seems a bit gloomy and dark  though thats not always a bad thing  the plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films  with some major twists  again  we are setup with several different characters  and one by one  they are picked off  however  while the first two had tons of arsenal  especially camerons film   alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this rundown prison  as a result  no weapons are to be found  this creates a lot of tension  although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense  as an alien film  alien 3 is the worst of the series  but by itself  it is an extremely wellmade motion picture  with a lot more merits than not  the unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the onedimensional characters  i never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about  despite this  ripley was the central figure  and thats what is important  we care for her  even though she began to act just like one of the guys  again  the technical side of this film is remarkable  and better than the two previous versions  while camerons version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary  fincher uses brilliant camera angles  terrific lighting  and moody sets  the cinematography  by alex thomson  is very well done  with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie  the confusion of the ending draws the viewer in  as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around  the yellows  reds  and oranges of the lights create a dark mood  and by themselves create a lot of suspense  shadows dance on the walls  and yet those shadows could easily be the alien  the alien is different from its predecessors this time around  and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense  the camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien  racing after the characters  the sets are quite incredible  which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien  the narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed  the sets appear to be in the future  but not too far in the future  one of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien  nothing surprising there   sigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance  equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens  she was snubbed at the oscars for this one  mainly because the film was a critical bomb  her reactions are far more realistic in this film  with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter  its quite touching really  charles s  dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates  and i was on the brink of actually caring for him  charles dance turns in a nice lowkey performance  and as a result  i cared for him immediately  lance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii  but he was more entertaining in aliens  the rest of the cast is pretty stale  though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world  alien 3 is rated r for strong violence and language  and sex  although it has its flaws  alien 3 is highly entertaining with rich symbolism  this film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie  while kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films  fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out  its a film like finchers which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity  the final scene   in fact  it tells us that we  as a society  have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little  fake   whenever something looks fake on screen  we immediately point it out as a mistake  but perhaps it isnt a mistake  
0	according to the publicity material  with this movie the directors  hope to restore good oldfashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness   hmm  you never know  they just might be on to something  what with the rise of geek chic  lounge music and seventies fashion  the evercontrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own  but then  i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it  its cheesy all right  but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch  thats a shame  because  in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more  woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise  roy munson  the movie opens in the fifties with roys dad dishing out the readers digestgumpian wisdom in scoopfuls  shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever  the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray  as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken  its thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good  he gives the wry  derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy  mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job  then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roys hand  then its fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat  balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand  hes hopeless until he meets ishmael  randy quaid   an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege  so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno  picking up pretty hustler claudia  vanessa angel  on the way  with the exit of bill murray  the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go  and thats    dumb and dumber  yes  indeed  kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour  peter and bobby farrelly  the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle  so  prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands  distended nipples  ridiculous hair and bull semen  get set for stock fishoutofwater situations when cityboy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community  or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking  striptease and unchristian neighboursocking  now  dont get me wrong  theres nothing wrong with cheap humour  and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy  the trouble is that these jokes arent bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction  it lurches from sports movie to amishmocking to roadtrip to sentimental melodrama   pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal  and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack   never quite getting it all together  some gags fall flat from a lack of buildup  while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply dont do anything  why the long  unfunny fight in the car park  why two of these  why does that guy wear mascara  or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it  the film is full of these halfthoughtthrough ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer  grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying   wouldnt that be funny    well  no  actually  the actors dont do the movie much favours either  woody harrelson comes off okay  plausibly acting dumb  smart  cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it  but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham  and vanessa angel has no talent  like schwarzenegger  she seems more convincing playing a computercreation than a human  take the tv series weird science    please    even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movies climax  all in all  a fairly useless attempt at comedy  and a certified nohoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance  well have to look to a reinspired john waters  or perhaps somebody from down under   strictly bowling   anyone   for the definitive bowling comedy  the flying inkpots rating system   wait for the video     a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha      pretty good  bring a friend       amazing  potent stuff        perfection  see it twice  
0	gregg arakis the doom generation was possibly the very worst film ever made  so why did i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus  first of all  some of the reviews were fairly positive  also  the cast  consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars  including christopher knight  eve plumb  shannen doherty  and david leisure  was promising  last of all  i wanted to give arraki one more chance  i mean  the guy cant be that untalented  can he  the answer to that question is three letters long  nowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles  since arraki doesnt know how to make anything coherent  its hard to describe the plot  lets just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend wont make a commitment to him and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys and girls  the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who has a chance encounter with a famous tv star  he turns out to be a nice guy who doesnt care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans  this story has a shocking twist and a tragic end that i did not see coming  it is the first time i ever felt any compassion for a character created by arraki  and this can be attributed to the appealing performance of lassez  i thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft  he works better with the camera this time around  especially in the early scenes  halfway through the film  i didnt necessarily find myself enjoying the film  but it seemed like a considerable improvement on the doom generation  then as the movie went on  arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us to exploding heads  twisted sex games  and alien abductions  its sad  because he almost actually had some decent material here  but he ruined it with his usual in your face  im such a renegade maverick filmmaker  look what i can do  attitude  the performances are generally better than in the doom generation  which isnt saying much  at least we dont have to suffer jonathan  i am the most hideous man in america  schaech  we are  however treated to another round of james  im more wooden than keanu  duval  sarah lassez gives the best performance in the film  and kathleen robertson  formerly of 90210 and now arrakis wife  and rachel true are talented actresses caught up in this mess  of the tv star cameos  john ritter is the most interesting as a deranged right wing tv evangelist  if i prefer nowhere to the doom generation  it is only in the way that i would prefer being assassinated than receive constant physical torture  maybe greg arraki doesnt want you to like his characters  maybe he wants to laugh and make fun of those of us who try to care about them  maybe he just wanted to piss me off  if so  he was successful  
1	capsule  this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii  life in a japanese prison camp  to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity  the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyones taste    3  4 to 4  more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way  this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law  during world war ii  of course  the one goal was winning the war  this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal  when the japanese had captured prisoners  they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal  minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output  while the germans  not known for their kindness in those days  had a 6 mortality rate among captured prisoners of war  the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27  the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad  that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do  the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day  and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll  in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany  filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story  perhaps for fear of offending the japanese  there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps  certainly there was david leans the bridge on the river kwai  there were some lowbudget british exploitation films and that was about it  then there were tv series  a town like alice  and  tenko   lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa  it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university  the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them  the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad  it turns out to be a grim joke  one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves  beating and torture are commonplace events  men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health  it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable  however  unlike as in kwai  the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital  called by the prisoners the death house  so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a raillaying machine  this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies  the japanese believe that the individual is nothing  that conformity to groups norms is all that gives a life meaning  conformity is purpose  before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp  if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story  if the british  with one american  by the way  and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story  it is neither  it is a stirring and believable account of camp life  the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow  this serves a double purpose for cunningham  it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat  it also creates a distancing effect  the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music  this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience  i rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale

1	  a bugs life  may not be  toy story   but its more close than  antz  was  i really liked  antz   basically because  yes  it is clever and witty and intelligent  and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead  perhaps the years most inspired casting   but there was  in fact  something missing from it  and im the first to admit that  maybe its that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun  its too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging  and if it werent for woody allen  it would have been just a really clever goodnotgreat flick    a bugs life  has a similar premise  and it also has disney to insure that its grated and not totally over kids heads like  antz  was  not a bad thing  believe me   but what it also has is a tone thats completely innocent even when its also remaining perpetually clever    antz  is still the more witty film  and i love it for it  and  a bugs life  is more for general consumption  but its also more entertaining  it broadens its horizons  and when it really moves from the ant colony  it really shows us a whole new world weve never seen before  and its take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in  antz   its also light and clever  the visuals are  instead of earth tones  bright worldly colors  and still gives the amazing visual technology of  antz  at least a worthy contender  the characters are also nicely realized  though watereddown for broad consumption  they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films  the lead character  flik  voiced by dave foley   is nothing more than a slightlyless neurotic z from  antz   but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z  instead of gene hackman playing the villain  we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper  the nicelytitled hopper  and for the romantic lead  we dont get spacey sharon stone  but intelligent and hardtoget julialouis dreyfuss  who doesnt even come around until the very final frames  not that the plots really any better than the one in  antz   its basically yet another redux of  the seven samurai   with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else  when flik  a bone fide inventor  creates a timeconserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the seasons donation  he puts them all in risk  and is sent away so that he wont screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers  he runs into a group of  warrirors  who are  unbeknownst to him  a group of carnival bugs  and they agree to help under similar false pretenses  these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in  toy story   foppish walking stick slim  david hydepierce   german caterpillar heimlich  joe ranft   quicktempered and insecure male ladybug francis  denis leary   pretentious praying mantis manny  jonathan harris   his assistant butterfly hypsy  madeliene kahn   spider rosie  bonnie hunt   and two fleas  tuck and roll  michael mcshane   who speak in undiscernable jibberish  the writers lightly touch on each bugs place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can  and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats  grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake  a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat  whose usual mildmannered squeal is a scream of death  the bug city is a modernday metropolis  complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb  holding out a cup  with a sign lying next to him that says  kid tore off wings   and a rainstorm is like a giant flood  with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour  around this  the pixar animators stage several large set pieces  like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year  and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end  a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket  meanwhile  each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting  something  antz  couldnt do  and by the end  over the end credits   a bugs life  pulls its final punch  out clevering  antz  with a series of incessantly hilarious fauxbloopers that come just at the right time  when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left  and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full moneys worth of entertainment  still  its no  toy story   that film  maybe above any animated film ive ever seen  encompassed almost true perfection in story  character  and wit  it proved that it didnt need to brag about its cutting edge technology to really soar  its the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far  but is still the most satisfying   and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun  yet  a bugs life   as well as  antz   are still amazing films  and prove without doubt  that if youre gonna make a computer animated film  send it to the guys who created these three flicks  evne if theyre not working under the same roof  
0	ugh  that about sums this movie up  just  ugh  the original godzilla movies are somewhat of a cult classic  and when reviewing the previous films  each film had a certain degree of intelligence  and that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following  in spite of bad special effects  horrible dubbing  and a man in a lizard suit  they maintained a certain degree of    how to put this     dignity  not quite the word im looking for  you understand  right  and in 50 years  godzilla has maintained that degree of whatever  leave it to america to screw the whole thing up  from the geniuses that brought us  independece day   arguably the worst scifi movie of all time  to ruin whatever reputation godzilla had  while they do bring us eyepopping special effects that will amaze you  they lost what was at the center of all the original godzilla movies  a storyline  summing up the movie is simple  heck  i can do it in one sentence  giant lizard attacks a giant city and a bunch of nobodies stop it  simple as that  matthew broderick stumbles over his lines  and its hard to picture hank azaria in any role besides his classic dogwalking character on the television show  mad about you   the dialogue seems to be improvized  almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all  i can see the scene on the set right now    all right  we spent all of this money making big special effects  and weve gotta get this movie out by summer or its going to bomb in our faces  so  you actors just say what ever comes to the top of your head  all right  make up something  mkay  good  roll film    the special effects are enough to keep you interested through one viewing  and some of the cinemtography is welldone  the scene with the black umbrellas comes to mind   still  an hour into it  you will become antsy  wondering how long they can drag it out  and drag it out they do   i have to laugh  the slogan for the film is   size does matter   i think they cut this too short  it should read   size does matter  acting does not   
1	this film is based on the campy tv show from the 1960s under the same appellation  mind you  most people  including yours truly  who will see this movie will not have seen any episodes from the original series  the movie is really a stand alone in that regard  the family robinson    lost in space  plot  set in the year 2058  the family robinson is chosen to sail out into space in search of other planets that might contain the natural resources earth needs in order to survive its future  a colonization process  if you will  they are joined by able pilot west  leblanc   and evil uninvited stowaway  oldman   who does not want to see the trip conclude on a successful tip  eventually  their trek goes awry  and all are  lost in space     how do get back to earth   is the question that infests the rest of this scifi epic  critique  this film reminded me a lot of the fifth element  6  510  from the summer of 1997  its a film with a lot of flash  but very little actual substance  admittedly  there isnt an annoying character like chris tucker from the other film  but this film does run a little too long  and did lose me in regards to its complex timetravel  multidimensional story line  having said that  the special effects in this movie were amazing  and the overall look and feel were also way above average  you really felt like you were in the future  and riding through space with these poor souls  unfortunately for this chosen family  their 10year old son is the smartest one in the group  and the father is too wrapped up in his work to notice the rest of his family  ever heard that one before  yawn    the acting is ok  and i was especially surprised at the solid performance by tv friends matt leblanc who shows us all that hes definitely more than just a pretty face  on the down side  the family riffraff that cuts through most of the picture is lame and timeconsuming  even though we gotta give them credit for  trying  to develop characters in a scifi pic   the story line is hard to follow  the evil character in the movie actually tells people that hes  evil   and the movie goes on for about 20 minutes too long  on the slick side  many of the special effects are really cool  the sequence in which the family is  paralyzed  during the hyperdrive is awesome  and the animated monkey that joins the family halfway through the flic is mucho cool   the credit presentation at the end of the film is slamming  and the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling  i will also admit that  somehow  they got me to semitear up near the conclusion of this picture     very odd        overall  if youre a big scifi fan  check this movie out for the special effects and challenging narrative  and if youre not  i would still suggest seeing this movie  but then you could probably wait until it comes out on video so that you forward past some of the boring parts  little known facts  this film will always be remembered as the movie that knocked titanic  710  out of the top spot at the boxoffice after 15 straight weeks at number one  garry oldman is british  and was once married to uma thurman for about six months  mimi rogers was tom cruises first wife  
1	as a devout atheist and an avowed believer in aliens  i have some idea of how ellie aroway  jodie foster  feels  but because my reasons for not partaking in religion are different than hers  i cant say that i do exactly  her reason is that she needs solid proof  there is no proof that god existed  so therefor she does not believe  ellie also believes in aliens  and has spent most of her life trying to prove they exist  how can she say she doesnt believe in god because of the lack of proof  and then say she believes in aliens  which are gereally less believed in than god without sounding like a hypocrite  thats the catch22  when aliens from the star vega fax her some plans for a device to transport someone to them  okay  well  they didnt really  fax  them     ellie wants to be the one to go  but because of her atheism she is denied the position  how dumb is that  she discovers the transmitions  then she isnt allowed to go  well  because of a bomb and a psychopath  jake busey   she  does  end up going  but not in the way that we wouldve thought  contact is based on a novel by carl sagan  who died during the filmmaking  it is the best alien movie since close encounters of the 3rd kind  and will end up being the best film of the year  its views of science and religion will no doubt aggrivate some  but will stimulate more  im glad at least one movie of the 90s can portray aliens in a psitive light  rather than a bunch of slimey beasts who will eat your insides and then put on your body  
0	retrospective  city of the living dead  1980  a film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as  dimwitted   and by golly  just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead  although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career  this is not one of them  two points in the movies favour  the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi  keep things from falling totally into the abyss  but by and large city of the living dead is a failure  and like most cinematic failures  it comes down to bad writing  dumb performances and lousy direction  the story starts in new york when  during a seance  a medium  katherine mccoll  sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich  massachusetts  for reasons we wont go into here  this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth  the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance  but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist  christopher george   that scene in itself is a howler  why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside  and dont cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before theyre buried  anyway  off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world  where various grisly goingson are already happening as all saints day approaches  fulcis graphic gore is in evidence once again  but here it only serves to further highlight the films flimsy script and plodding direction  the dialogue  in all manner of speaking  is unspeakable  not bad in the quotable sense  like an ed wood film  but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious  lets explain the plot  type approach  mccoll doesnt have a clue who her character is  deadly serious one minute  frivolous the next  she at times is genuinely hard to watch  and the geezer  the actors name escapes me  who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses  christopher georges performance is salvageable  but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we dont care  in fact we dont care for anyone in city of the living dead  though in other fulci films that hasnt mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist and an ideas man  as he was in the beyond  as a director  some of fulci idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here  he constantly uses extreme closeups of peoples eyes  a ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors arent capable of  and despite some gruesome violence  he barely manages a single scare in the entire film  longtime collaborator fabio frizzi  talented but always erratic  offers a patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie  gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electropop thats quite frankly embarrassing  fulcis other films of this period may be flawed  house by the cemetery  the beyond  the black cat  but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration  atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey  for completists only  
0	i looked at the  internet movie database  s awards section for this film  and found that this was nominated for a golden globe for  best picture  drama    anyone whos seen this film can back me up on this  this is the worst of the  great  disaster films  and thats not really saying a lot for this film    earthquake  is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured  on video  its a bland and slowmoving film which gives us a bunch of different characters  the disaster film requisite   then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster  while this worked in  say   the towering inferno   it doesnt here for one single reason  we dont care about any of the characters  the film gives us charlton heston  in one of many crap 70s films he made  including  skyjacked  and that classic   soylent green   as a rich man married to ava gardner  who is having a little affair with a young single mom  genieveve bujold   a renegade police officer on suspension  george kennedy  in his least humored performance   in the second weirdest subplot  a motorcycle stuntman  richard roundtree  right after his  shaft  thing  whose big stunt is he goes on a little track that goes upside down  yea  snore   and the weirdest subplot  a military manbag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principal  and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair       in smaller subplots  theres a pointless bit about people who are flying over l  a   the city in the film  by the way   one whos playing cards and married to a boring nonacting husband  you think this one can go nowhere  guess again  he gets interested in the final frames   theres genieveve bujolds moron son  who has a little adventure with wires  and for some muchneeded comedy  theres walter matthau  billed as walter mutha      the only laugh in the film   as a wild drunkard  whos big moment is a dance he does at a critical time  as for the actual  earthquake   its rather a letdown  theres a full hour of charactersetups  none of which is interesting  then about 10 minutes of shaking  crumbling  and a bit where a house almost falls on bujold  narrowly missing   this film needed that whole theatreshaking  they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored  theres little suspense following the quake  although this film tries for it  theres an adventure in a crumbling highrise office building  the wires with the kid  and the movement of people who are all injured  but none of these are alltoo suspenseful  the finale with the hestongardnerbujold love triangle is ended in a basic flipofthecoin bit  which brings out a big letdown  and theres no real finale  even  volcano  ended nicely  and that movie really sucked  not only is it hokey  but you dont care about any character  who cares if heston dies  who cares if he choses bujold or gardner  although i would have chosen gardner  mainly on the basis that she can actually act   who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid  stunt   who cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires  and who cares about that whole plane spiel  if anything   earthquake  is worth a viewing for the same reason  glen or glenda   is  i mean  i laughed at this more than i did at  bio dome   but thats another story  and review   in short   earthquake  gives disaster pics a bad name  
1	i guess its a credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour 2 could not be ruined even by the nauseating  comedy  of chris tucker  im a fan of jackie chan in just about any medium  and this movie lets him not only do his impressiveasever martial arts schtick  but show off his comic timing as well  it would have worked better if he was the only name above the title  the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects  this time around  the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan  john lone   who makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into the united states  im still not sure how you can make a fortune doing that  is there a place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones    the only way to tell the phony money from the genuine article is to set it on fire and see what color it burns  of course  its up to hong kong detective lee  chan  and trashtalking lapd detective james carter  tucker  to take the bad guys out and the authorities  to the extent that they even exist  stay out of their way  rush hour 2 turns the tables on the first film in that here its carter who gets the two of them into trouble and lee who winds up having to get them out  i guarantee that my rating would have been at least a half of a grade higher had anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan  he refuses to shut up  not only did his voice feel like a jackhammer on my head  but his jokes just arent funny  a pathetic mixture of subpar eddie murphy fasttalking blather and wannabe chris rock whitemanblackman jokes that wind up being more offensive than funny  i realize that in a movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates  but didnt anyone realize how irritating tuckers incessant ranting and raving was  if this is all the comedian has to offer then i dont care to see any more of his films  fortunately  chan makes for a marvelous straight man  and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely  its not often that one actor can so completely save a movie  but there is no other name for what he does  whenever hes on screen  rush hour 2 comes to nearly breathtaking  often hilarious  life  much of it hinges on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch chan try to be a  player   but who cares  i can think of few high concepts that are funnier  the movie ends with outtakes that  as usual  show that chan isnt perfect  and that it does  indeed  take him a few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to look seamless  chris tucker botches some lines as well  and his mistakes are funnier than anything he says in the whole movie  a lot of people have pointed out rush hour 2 isnt very different from its predecessor in tone or style  but i liked the original  and i like the sequel  though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it  director brett ratner  the family man  keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes  i guess sometimes the shotgun approach works   its not great jackie chan  but its jackie chan  and thats enough  up next  jay and silent bob strike back 
1	a lot of times a threestar film will be my favorite  theyre usually the kind of movie i can watch most often too  theyre usually not too deep  allowing for semibrainless relaxation  and at the same time  not too dumb  men in black is a fourstar threestar film    hope you could follow that one  men in black doesnt wait to get to the fun  just minutes into the film we are introduced to agent kay  tommy lee jones   introduced to an alien  and introduced to the the awesome memorydiminishing tool that all mib agents use  after all  you cant have alien witnesses running around with that kind of knowledge can you  men in black is  of course  the organization which  moniters all extraterrestrial activity on earth   nypd officer james edwards  will smith   is on a routine foot chase when suddenly the nogood punk hes chasing starts leaping up buildings and blinking more than one pair of eyes  the alien delivers the simple message that the world is going to end  and with that  dives off of a roof  naturally nobody believes his story      nobody that is  except for the top secret organization that not even the government is aware of  edwards then meets agent kay  the man who never seems to crack a smile  and is introduced to the mib  edwards winds up joining the team and is stripped of anything that can point back to him  birth certificate  drivers license  and even the literal removal of his fingerprints   james edwards no longer exists  meet agent jay  agent kay takes the rookie jay under his wing as they go about  regular  duties  eventually a far more treacherous event comes into play  a  bug  has landed on earth and is going to wipe out mankind if these two dont  or cant  stop it  the plot isnt exactly clear  but we know it has to do with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on earth  and that is crucial that the mib find it before the  bug  does  barry sonnenfeld  who also did the addams family films  directs this nicely  its fun  its funny  its actionpacked  a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned out to be  this is one of those movies that is just  fun  and cant really be summed up any nicer or clearer  will smith and tommy lee jones both do great jobs and both are a blast to watch  definitely one of the best films of the the summer of 97  men in black comes highly recommeded from me  
0	note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  be forewarned  i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 sciencefiction flick species  squandering an intriguing premise  the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess  widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike  and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success  raking in over 60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast  ben kingsleys a splendid actor  but a marquee name he aint   miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film  i doubted that theyd dare tempt fate and go for another round  so here comes species ii  with a new creative team  director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman  respectively  that fails to improve the series one iota  like its predecessor  species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid  the film follows the exploits of a young man  patrick ross  justin lazard   whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women  loitering in strip clubs  and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can  in other words  patrick is like a lot of guys  these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age  but theres a catch  hes an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars  and whos now infected with alien dna  patricks overriding compulsion  to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring  and when he becomes aware of eve  natasha henstridge   a halfhuman  halfalien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab  patricks primary focus turns to her   if these two were to mate  the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable  warns dr  laura baker  marg helgenberger  gamely reprising her role  with admirable conviction  species ii opens with the mars mission  and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokeylooking  even splicing back to dated  grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities  they really skimped on production values this time around  however  this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick  watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship  any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy bmovie is quickly answered  mr  brancatos original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches  like the first film  and perhaps in homage to it   theres a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious  last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitakers psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room   something bad happened here   this time  laura gets to stand over a fresh  shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter  this is awful   and shes not even empathic  and when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefullypaced suspense sequence  eve  whos telepathically linked to her alienhumanhybrid counterpart  whatever   helpfully tells our alienhunting protagonists   hes going to rape her   while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious  at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own  theres an amusing  tongueincheek bit of product placement  which doesnt really make much sense  but i appreciated the sentiment   as well as some supermarketrelated hijinx   hes in aisle 1   informs eve   if the film maintained this sort of lighthearted tone  it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch  but  to its detriment  it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody  effectsladened anticlimactic conclusion  much of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense  and there are such gaping plot holes that its terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief  the implausibilities are endless  what about the toxic bomb in eves brain  why are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual  my favourite was the slowmotion sequence in the film where eve  sporting superhuman strength  is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks  this is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief  incredulous that its being foisted upon the public  returning headlines michael madsen  who reprises tough guy press lennox  and ms  helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay  but theres realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis  mykelti williamson  portraying astronaut dennis gamble  churns out an alltoofamiliar spin on a generic brashmouthed character  and fine character actors george dzundza  playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process  and james cromwell  patricks neglectful father  senator ross  are utterly wasted in the film  mr  lazard gives his character an appropriately shiftyeyed look  while returning vixen ms  henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene  and acquits herself nicely   but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing  or none at all   ms  henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series  claiming that  shes so empowered   a lethal halfalien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion  now  thats  what i call empowerment

0	the crown jewel of 1970s irwin allen disaster movies  the poseidon adventure features an allstar cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship  the story begins on the u  s  s  poseidons big new years cruise  where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive  lets see  theres the new age preacher  hackman  who advises people to  pray to that part of god within yourself   theres the excop  borgnine  who busted a hooker  stella stevens  six times  then married her  theres the hippie singer   theres got to be a morning after      who turns to the company of a lonely man  red buttons  once her brother is killed  and to round out the group  the elderly couple  jack albertson and shelley winters  who live aboard the ship  the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall  we get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure  before straight faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship  everyones in the giant ballroom at the time  shortly past midnight of the new year  when the ship turns first on its side  then completely upside down  the second incommand wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives  but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship  in this case  because the ship is overturned  the top is the bottom  or is the bottom the top  either way  we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and  in the ballroom scene  christmas trees  thus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors  through burning rooms  etc  while the ship slowly fills with water behind them  its a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting  the poseidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laugh at  with all the melodrama that comes inbetween the nonthrilling action scenes  the one note in borgnines onenote performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love  although since there isnt a sex scene  we never find out if his buttons really are red  and albertson and winters wonder if theyll live to see their grandsons birth  shelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end  where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along  winters  who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie  stevens even notso affectionately calls her  fatass  in one scene   finally finds her purpose    i was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when i was seventeen   she brags  and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years  shes swimming through the water  her skirt billowing up around her hips  showing off her cellulite  or do you call it shellulite   ridden thighs  its not so much funny as innately disgusting  which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as a whole  
0	its difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishments to date are a handful of  awardwinning  tv commercials  as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes  that said  hayess feature film debut lives up to expectations  coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic  but occasionally  bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary  those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the films two stars  jake gyllenhall as the immunodeficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his overprotective  hyper religious  reaganloving mother  gyllenhalls sweetnatured delivery of jimmys hilariously na  ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy comingofage story  jimmy is a bubble boy  a kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with a single germ  a plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld  his mom homeschools jimmy  filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and antisexual messages  until hes befriended by chloe  marley shelton   the beautiful girl next door  jimmy falls in love with chloe  but is afraid that his love will literally kill him  as evidenced in a scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for a kiss  but when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend  jimmy builds a bubble suit and embarks on a hijinksaddled crosscountry voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love  the offensive bits have little to do with jimmys rare handicap  regardless of what the films protesters would have you believe   but instead center on outrageous racial stereotypes  including a screaming chinese strip club owner and a devout east indian hindi  but even if you find stereotype humor funny  its hard to muster more than a giggle for these shallow gags  they even manage to bungle some potentially great moments with a group of carnival freaks  but a few of the harsh jabs manage to work  especially in the case of kurtz  who very bluntly shows the dark  hypocritical side of the religious right  and a wacky sendup of a cult called  bright n shiny   led by the inimitable fabio  unfortunately  a few giggles cant make bubble boy the riotous  offthewall comedy it so desperately wants to be  honestly  its a mystery how on earth this movie was ever made  and im not just saying that because its so mediocre  how odd for disney to take a gamble on a film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that doesnt seem to appeal to any particular demographic and has the potential to offend so many  and now that the studio is suffering through a very public protest against the film by the parents of reallife bubble boy david philip vetter  maybe disneys wondering the same thing  hope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile  
1	originally launched in 1978  this popular film was reintroduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers  based on the mighty successful musical from broadway  grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2  6  510   starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles  plot  highschool musical set in the 1950s showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the tbirds  travolta  and the innocent and pure sandy olsen  newtonjohn  from australia  the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song  dance and humour  critique  funloving  energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler  this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950s  with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers  admittedly  i am somewhat biased in this opinion  since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth  grease was one of schmoes first bigscreen experiences  and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubblegum card collection   and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time  but apart from the nostalgic vibe  i was still extremely impressed by this film  as it continued to amuse me  despite my previous dozen or so viewings  this film took john travolta from a dimwitted  sweathog  on tvs welcome back kotter  and transformed him into a moviestar of spectacular proportions  saturday night fever  7  510  in 1979 confirmed that sudden popularity   unfortunately for the rest of the cast  his popularity was not terribly contagious  despite their effective showings in this classic movie  on the down side  some of the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn people off  like when sandy sings about  drinking lemonade  and  staying out until 10  with danny in  summer nights    and the plot isnt exactly the most elaborate storyline ever created  but despite these small reservations  this movie carries enough great music and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid 110 minute running time  and believe me    i am not a fan of the musicals     make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player  as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the films absolute highlights  and dont forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards  so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever youre feeling a little blue  little known facts  henry winkler  of tvs happy days fonzie fame  turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want to be typecast for the rest of his career  both travolta and conaway were smitten by newtonjohn during the filming of this picture  conaway eventually bowed out of the woofest  and married newtonjohns sister a year later  divorced after five years   
0	retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year  earlier this may  leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the toprated miniseries that debuted on cbs  and now  director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies  starring milla jovovich  who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch  the messenger  the story of joan of arc is a disjointed and overblown historical reenactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend  besson  whos previous work includes the hyperactive scifi the fifth element  perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in exwife jovovich  because in the messenger  the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience  at first  when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role  i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber  after seeing the rousing trailer  my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed  milla jovovich looked superb  with the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance  the messenger looked like a timeless epic in the making  a timeless epic it is not  besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style  and the story behind the messenger is not entirely suited to his demands  on the shoulders of bessons choppy and unexciting direction  the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery  there is no human exploration into the character of joan  or jeanne   jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective  jovivichs unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard  she is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast  jovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power  but mainly  she looks lost  quite frankly  i dont know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through the messenger without a major fumble  the script is chockfull of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy  as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii  john malkovich  and informs him of her heavenly intentions  faye dunaway plays charles overbearing motherinlaw  and dustin hoffman appears over twohours into the story as a character dubbed  the conscience  all three actors juggle limited screen time  although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful  the battle scenes are extremely bloody  but with the presence of such jittery camera work  they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like braveheart  theres a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on  when jeanne  as a young girl  watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier  even his fellow troopers are petrified  the messenger is also strictly a 90s update on the classic story  almost too 90s  it seems  theres gratuitous use of the fword and a barrage of slang terms like shes nuts   sprinkled throughout the screenplay  i was halfexpecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib  but it never happened  theres also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor  but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly  it seems terribly misplaced  but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as the messenger  almost everything does  the musical score by erric serra is spectacular  and the set and production designs are continuously impressive  if it was visual excellence that besson was striving for  then he achieves his goal  but the only time the dramatics come alive in the messenger is during the closing trial  in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake  during these moments  the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience  albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning  its just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation  in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects  the messenger  the story of joan of arc is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf  anyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film  despite my original hopefulness  milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking the academy  
0	i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film  i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying   it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday  and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach  throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof  well have a hit on our hands   the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film  a mishmash collage of onedimensional characters  rampant stereotypes of cultures and races  cliched emotional statements of purpose  and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography  the story is loosely based around the pro football players strike in 1987 and a ragtag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels  keanu reeves stars as shane falco  a hasbeen football college player looking for redemption  gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers  rounding out the cast includes swingers jon favreau  7up pitchman orlando jones  gruff owner jack warden  and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters  the drunken welshman  the overweight sumo wrestler  the black convict  the violent cop  and the dumb  dumb cheerleaders  this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays  gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is  keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field  and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from dennys  the usual things happen like clockwork  the hero rises from the ashes of failure  the team comes together in unity  the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest  the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap  and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax  its also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks  howard deutch  who was behind the camera for two of the best films of 80s  pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful  has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes  obviously the problem is that without a good script  any director will fail in the end  sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory  gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds  the rise and fall of gallant heroes  and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life  the replacements offers none of this  
1	  youll go ape over tarzan because its more fun than a barrel of monkeys   okay  theres the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie  disneys latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning  skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship  father  mother  and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins  and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson  its amazing  the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack  before you know it  an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala  glenn close   a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard  against the wishes of her mate and family leader  kerchak  lance henricksen   she takes on the infant boy as her own  tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild  much of tarzans young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his  father   which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how wellmeant his attempts  all hes looking for is acceptance  perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers  but one which will ring true with a lot of adults  when you really think about it  this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end  look back on past disney animated features and youll see the trend  growing up  tarzan  voiced by alex d  linz as a child  and by tony goldwyn as an adult  has a couple of friends  one is an ape named terk  rosie odonnell   and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor  wayne knight   both provide the requisite comic relief  timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind  and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold  im beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films  just fill in the blanks  can you see it    now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief  but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it  weve already had a fish and a crab  and weve had a candle and a teapot  a genie and a dog  a few stone statues     have we had an ape and an elephant yet  well  there we go   of course  theres gotta be romance somewhere along the line  so jane  minnie driver  gets introduced about halfway through  together with her father dr  porter  nigel hawthorne  and the big game hunter clayton  brian blessed   jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa  she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately  and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory  you tarzan  me jane  scene  thankfully  those arent the exact words  however  i found it distracting that tarzan is going  ohh ohh ee ee  one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction  how does he tell his name to another ape    ohh ohh ee  tarzan  ee ee ohh   well  regardless of my picky nature  the romance actually works as only disney romance can  purely contrived  but for some reason rather believable  but hey  tarzans a young adult  do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane  isnt that illegal in most countries  oh  well  i dont think disney will be using my quote anymore  tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical  theres lots of music to be sure  but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time  we instead get more of a phil collins concert  as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material  this isnt really a bad thing  as the songs are very highenergy and catchy  i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day   its just different  do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system  because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie  with each new feature  disney animation gets even better  not necessarily by leaps and bounds  but since they put out a new film each year  a steady rate of improvement is apparent  and this definitely shows in tarzan  there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3d effect  and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying  the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers  and had me thinking this isnt just tarzan  its  extreme tarzan   however  tarzan does not seem to have what i call its  chandelier scene   which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort  utilizing a computerassisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking  lasting but a few seconds at most  its been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast  in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail  as usual  the voice talent is up to snuff  convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters  the one poor choice in casting  however  was rosie odonnell  going into the film  i didnt know she was even a part of it  but when terk started talking  i recognized her voice immediately  her performance was fine  but through the rest of the film i kept thinking   thats no boy ape  that rosie odonnell   distracting to say the least  ill admit ive never read the edgar rice burroughs story  tarzan of the apes   so i couldnt tell you how true this film stays to the book  but unless youre a purist  you should have few objections to this film  with solid performances  action  adventure  a bit of romance  and great music and animation  tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us  note  when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago  i went off on the promotional and merchandising tieins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature  this time  ill just say that i went to mcdonalds yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry  and tarzan was on the cup  nuff said

1	since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what theyre portraying  its fitting to say that  beloved  come as a real shock as a film  its confusing  bizarre  and as tough a film to watch as any film ive seen all year  and thats not necessarily because of the threehour running time    beloved  is challenging to watch  filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard  and instead of a straightforward  hollywoodized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed   beloved  comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened  or  rather  toni morrison  who wrote the novel upon which this is based     beloved  tells the story of an exslave named sethe  played by oprah winfrey  who lives on a large farm in the north with her children  when the film opens  her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist  which shakes things up  wounds the dog  and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family  sethe is proud  though  and will not move  her sons run away  leaving only her and her daughter  denver  kimberly elise  alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation  a couple years pass  and the ghost remains  and one day  a man named paul d  danny glover   another exslave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together  arrives  asking for lodging  he has been wandering around since he left the plantation  and when he enters the house  it turns red and becomes incredibly hot  when he remarks about what he thinks is evil  sethe replies  it aint evil  its just sad   some more time passes  and paul d has become a fervent member of the household  and the ghost disappears  but when they return one day from going out  they discover a young woman sitting in the house  her name is beloved  and as played by thandie newton  she has almost zero motor skills  she stumbles around  halfgrabbing onto things and knocking them over  and when she speaks  she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk  they let her into her house  and she begins to turn things upside down    beloved  acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story  most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic  lowlit room  with the occasional flash to the past  where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modernday psychoanalysts  sethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation  which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands  with her nipples being licked  prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it   they took my milk   worst of all was the month after her freedom  when she was allowed to live like a free person  working with other blacks on a farm  and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back  she runs to the barn near by  carrying her four children  and when her old owners burst in  they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they dont leave them alone  when she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film  she says she doesnt regret it  she killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did  and she has convinced herself she did the right thing  of course  beloved is really her daugher materialized  though we arent flat out told that until later on in the film  beloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long  thus   beloved  becomes a sortaredux of the andrei tarkofsky scifi classic   solaris   where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife  who commited suicide years before  has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system  that film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories  how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past  and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us  it would control us completely    beloved  moves along freely  without a lot of explanation  and for the most part  this is extremely respectable  the most interesting films are the ones that dont explain everything for us  leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense  sethe is never fully explained as a character  but we understand all her actions since shes being played by oprah winfrey  its been well over a decade since her last major performance in  the color purple   but judging from these two films  ill bet shes one of the best actresses working today    if she was strictly an actress  her talk show  which i suppose is a great entity  has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress  and thats a shame because she brings so much to this movie  emotion  sadness  strength  watching the strong sethe  whos so afraid of the past that shes built a rather strong protective coating around herself  break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great  she makes it real  thats not to say this is a perfect film  in fact  id wager to say that the fact that its confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is  while oprahs performance is powerful and easily sympathetic  and im dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february   the structure of the film  which doesnt show what happened to her children till halfway through the film  prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film  it doesnt necessarily move as though theyre memories of one particular character  and by the end  it has lost control over sethe  and as she takes to bed  we are unable to truly identify with her anymore  but despite its tediousness  perhaps thats the point  the distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start  since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable  and it needs to get back with reality  and for the most part  this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be  jonathan demmes direction is bizarre  in nature with the story  and he creates the right mood  making it a tough film to sit through  making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters  theres more to admire here  like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization  just like they would be in real life  and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering  but laced with a touch of optimism  the acting  not only from winfrey  is amazing  and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination  everyone has been raving about thandie newtons performance  and how it should be rewarded  however  it must be noted that out of everyone  she had the easiest part  act like a baby  throw things  stumble around  chew food with your mouth open  i do think theres another performance worthy of oscar conisderation  but its kimberly elise  as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane  and has to carry the burden of her mothers loss of reality towards the end  its not that newton isnt great  shes as annoying and wacky as the role demands  its just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better  despite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it  and not that of writer morrison or director demme   beloved  has still not done well  costing  i think  around ninety million dollars  it has since grossed about twentytwo  unfortunately  this film is a little too intense for viewers  even for me  and i can stand almost anything  i recently viewed the 2 12 hour long epic  caligula   the worst film i have ever seen in my life  and did it in a mere 2 sittings   although i respect  beloved   i cant say that i really enjoyed it  
1	the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate  people are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future  after a sort of confusing bit involving fakelooking cyborg things  the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds  the basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while  make that every 1000 years or so  an evil force comes to destroy earth  the things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element  the plot in this movie really isnt that important to the thing though  this movie has very good special effects  for the most part  the technoish music in the background fits the mood very well  bruce willis is an illegal taxicab driver in a futuristic new york city  one day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk  this movie is about what happens  the plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations  also there is a fair bit of action in the film  particularly towards the end  some characters are just plain strange including a highlyenergetic deejay in drag  bruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does  the movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down  it is one of those scifi films where youll be saying  cool  followed by a  what the hell       i give the fifth element  
1	many people dislike french films for their lack of closure  while possibly shallow  ive often had a desire for a sense of epiphany  or at least a resolution  in the films which i view  there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional  however  the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passiondenying protagonist  stephane  daniel auteuil   stephane  daniel auteuil  is a master violin maker  he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing  even the relationship between he and his boss  maxime  andre dussollier  is a controlled  and almost manipulated association  highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches  in the beginning of the movie  stephane is a closed  solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man  camille kessler  emmanuelle beart  is a master violinist and the new love of maximes  maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife  like stephane  camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved  sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges  when stephane and camille meet  there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals  however  whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane  stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him  stephane ignores his feelings for camille  which the audience cannot help but to see is present  as the movie progresses  the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another  these two people  with very similar approaches to life initially  react to their new circumstance very differently  stephane becomes even more rational and controlled  while camille becomes more tempestuous  until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship  however  their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation  the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well  due to his relationship with a master violin teacher  however  apparently  he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing  consequently  stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays  in contrast  camille had almost given the violin  years earlier  however  with the aid of her manager  she has progressed to being almost one of the worlds finest  successfully submerging herself to her playing  during the course of the movie  we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions  stephane attempts to remain unchanged  however  we do see subtle hints of his transformation  one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash  the development of all of the characters  many of which is not included in this synopsis  is incredible  american movies  with rare exceptions  have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development  in its essence  this movie is about the development and growth of the characters  camille and stephane  the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie  including a death  is to further the development of camilles and stepahnes characters  i am not sure why berardinelli says   at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified  and it is to auteuils credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty   this movie is not about judging stephanes actions as being right or wrong  but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are  i find the ending appropriate  unfortunately  i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling  this portion of the film is where the  sense of closure  could have been successfully accomplished  unfortunately  there is a hurried and almost a soap operatype surge of emotions from all of the characters  while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart  ravel has his day in this film  the synergism of the tension of ravels music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen  the directing in this movie is wonderful  the actors and actresses are excellent  each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth  emmanuelle bearts personality is beautiful  and needless to say  i must say that emmanuelle beart  herself  is beautiful  besides the near ending  the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral  i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of  the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot  has their attitude towards love changed  i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at  but i am unsure of which the director is espousing  in summary  this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship  in the process  we see their attitude towards life and other people  in itself  i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie  where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we  as americans  have preconceived american notions of relationship  love  and people  i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture  however  i  bringing my american preconceptions  enjoyed the film  i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it  
1	theres an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last  george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy  return of the jedi  the final installment of the series  is easily the most innovative  actionpacked  and entertaining of the three films  the dark  eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone  instead  for return of the jedi  we have good triumphing decisively over evil  a resolution to a love triangle  and walking teddy bears  even darth vader doesnt seem very intimidating this time around  with the arrival of the emperor  an apparitionlike creature played by ian mcdiarmid   vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman  return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back  luke skywalker  mark hamill   princess leia  carrie fisher   lando calrissian   billy dee williams   chewbacca  peter mayhew   c3p0  anthony daniels  and r2d2  kenny baker  are on a rescue mission to lukes home planet of tatooine  their goal  to save han solo  harrison ford  from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt  it is at jabbas home  a creepylooking stone fortress guarded by hognosed beasts  that most of the added special effects come into play  from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabbas sand barge  the effects are top notch  as soon as han is freed from his cryofreeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt  its back to outer space  where the rebel alliance is about to face the empires newest threat  a second  more powerful death star  that  if activated  could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor  so  while the fleet prepares for the final battle  luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks  there  they are befriended by the ewoks  the teddy bearlike native race  and luke  fearing that his presence is endangering the group  turns himself over to vader  return of the jedi has some interesting elements  the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and wellacted  from a technical pointofview  the space battles are amazing  easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films  not only are there many  many more ships  but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved  on one level  return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects  in the special edition  even more ships are added  making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch  the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films  by now  or then  1983   mark hamill  harrison ford  and carrie fisher have all matured in their onscreen personas  the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific  as in empire  billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for  newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy  cunning  and evil creature  although hes not as imposing as vader was in star wars  although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen  return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment  with the spectacular  new special effects  the adorable ewoks  the sinister jabba the hutt  the evil emperor  the same old millenium falcon  darth vaders incredible betrayal  the destruction of the new death star  and the always lovable yoda  return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang  congratulations to george lucas  whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come    
0	are you like me  do you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places  shouting out loud  not giving a ratts ass about anyone around them  and basically just wallowing in their own selfimportance  well if you are  than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour and a half    only to make up and hug in the end  aaaaaaaahhhh    plot  three grownup sisters living their own separate lives  begin to reestablish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill  critique  this would be a good movie if it wasnt for the fact that its got very little to say  features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations  is chockfull of bad acting moments and provides less emotional satisfaction than any thirdrate afterschool special  and im being nice  how junk like this gets made is beyond me  but happy am i that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt a professional blow  considering the regurgitation level of their material had just about reached its limit  the only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryans character and her dad in this film is when he hugs her and swings her around at a christmas tree lot  wow    how deep  of course  the same christmas tune thats played in every ephron flick chimes out in the background  while characters continue to build  bonds  among one another by making reference to old  quaint movies or movie stars  stop me    im gonna cry again  this film is a mess  the characters are boring and irritating to watch  the plot has something to do with three selfish sisters talking on the phone a whole lot  kind of liking their father  but not really  and then finally realizing the error of their ways  while sharing an  emotional  moment about movie stars from the 50s  admittedly  i was not expecting much from a film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds and a big dog rolling its eyes  but even i was surprised at the level of ineptitude when it came to some of the acting efforts put forth in this film  meg did fine as the sister who cries a lot  looking as adorable as ever  but someone please put lisa kudrow inside a permanent home of limited range  cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movietv show that shes in  enough already  and diane keaton mustve spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one  cause her acting was amateurish at best  neither one convinced in  emotional  scenes  granted  they gave walter matthau the best lines in the film and thats probably where my rating of three points comes from  all in all  this movie is not funny  unless youre one to chuckle at train wrecks   provides zero drama  unless you consider loud phone conversations moving   generates absolutely no emotion  although i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine  and ends on a perfectly pretentious note   oh no  please dont get any flour on my donna karan dress    ugh  i suggest that all ladies take their husbandsboyfriends to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something  thatll teach em to mess with you  oh and incidentally  mrs  joblo also likened this movie to a piece of cow dung flailing in the wind  so there  then again    maybe youll like it     
1	i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of  good will hunting   based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film  in which the main character will hunting  matt damon   an mit janitor in his early twenties  is discovered to be an einsteinlevel closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight  the only problem is that will is a tough street kid whos had his share of runins with the law  and before long hes being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight  professor lambeau  stellan skarsgard   who had brought up the math problems in his lectures  tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police  will is to be released  provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions  this sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff  but  good will hunting  rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama  a conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and wills therapist sean mcguire  robin williams   lambeau wants to get will to use his brain  while sean wants him to listen to his heart  both of which he has been largely neglecting  will finds that the former is much easier than the latter  so much so  in fact  that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeaus attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle  he also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar  minnie driver   an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her  what makes  good will hunting  work so well  aside from the strong performances  especially from damon and williams   is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in wills life  the scripts sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau  but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong  lambeau  while he may seem a little cold at times  is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when were not sure if we like what he has to say  and sean  for all his warmheartedness  has  as lambeau and later will point out  not lived up to his full intellectual potential either  the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will  wills reaction to this situation  and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean  is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters opinions  rather than setting up an obvious  right  and  wrong  side and beating them over the head with it  for a film with such an extraordinary character   good will hunting  presents itself as remarkably ordinary  it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman  a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another  this film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama  by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally farfetched situation    good will hunting  also has its share of fun humor  such as when will  in an early therapy session  pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture  and in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear  will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa  wills relationship with his friends  most notably chucky  ben affleck   is usually rather amusing  if somewhat crude  the film has 100 uses of the f word  which was most likely the reason for its rrating   and lends itself well to the development of wills character  add all this to the fact that  good will hunting  even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental  and you might be wondering why i havent given this film four stars  well  for one thing  no matter how well damon and affleck  who wrote the screenplay  and director gus van sant pull it off  the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original  there are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic  including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions  still   good will hunting  takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would  and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years  and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of 97 films  
0	this movie is based off the wildly popular videogame series of the same name  before this film  the game had a few spinoff cartoons which were ok  but the idea of doing a movie is insane  it should have been animated  if it should have been done at all  instead the people do the best they can with a talented cast  yet it still fails  the plot is completely different from the games plot im not complaining about that  the story involves the mario bros  having a plumbing business in brooklyn and having to compete with a rival company  eventually they find a construction site by their nemesis  which happens to be enviromentally unsafe  so  due to luigis  john leguizamo  girlfriend  princess daisy  they go and investigate  they get transported to a blade runneresque world lead by king koopa  dennis hopper   somehow a plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic megacity jumbles in  the plot is fine better than the movie deserves  the acting is ok  this seems to be more of a visual film  the special effects are good  especially on the robotic yoshi  however the film drags and is no fun  and it leaves itself open to a sequel  which probably wont ever be made  this movie begins sort of promising  but ends up leaving a weird taste in your mouth  so if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper  then watch super mario bros   the movie  you could do worse  but you could definitely do better      street fighter  the movie  1995  starring  raul julia and jean claude vandamme this movie was based off of a series of never ending sequels to a game called street fighter 2  it has all the characters from the game in a reasonable plot  it is more like a  movie  than it should be  yes  its watchable  raul julia does a good job  considering this was his final film  while the game had nonstop fighting sequences  this movie is a hodgepodge of action scenes and flashy sets and costumes while trying to show off a plot at the same time  does it work  sort of    the plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m  bison  raul julia   guile  jean claude vandamme  takes his troops to attack bisons main base in an attempt to liberate the innocent villages he has taken over  in a short amount of time  the movie introduces several characters well  it catches your attention  but it ultimately seems like a showcase for fans of the game so you can point out things like  theres chun li    or  look at that fireball ryu did at vega   it hits the bases by presenting the characters in a plot with good sets  but goes no further  this movie needed more action in the first place  the action scenes that are here are short and not very exciting  if you like lighthearted action flicks  or if you liked the game  watch this one  it is even worth watching if you want to see raul julias last performance  or if you cant get enough of van damme  other than that  you could find better action flicks    
1	anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases      especially hercules     emotion  all the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences arent going to hold anyones interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together  not since disneys beauty  the beast has there been such a compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works  the story of the romanov family  the rulers of russia  and their downfall begins the film  anastasia  one of the daughters  narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin  voiced by christopher lloyd  with her grandmother  voiced by angela landsbury   but anastasia gets lost  and grows up with no memory of her royal origins  the grandmother lives in paris  hoping to someday find her beloved anastasia  the only member of the family to survive the russian revolution  a young woman named anya  voiced by meg ryan  runs across dimitri  john cusack  and vlad  kelsey grammar   who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother and get the reward money  they pick anya to pose as their princes  and of course  it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia  dimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is a commoner  and meanwhile  rasputin is not dead  and plots his revenge against the last romanov  the plot is actually quite well structured  there are a lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later  but it moves along fast enough that theyll never have time to be bored  what this really means is that the adults wont be bored by it either  there is a great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny  and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses  there is  of course  lots of comedy for the kids  including rasputins pet bat  bartok  hank azaria   who is easily the funniest thing in the film  however  the comical scenes never distract from the drama  but are worked into the plot almost seamlessly  the animation is gorgeous  the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators  not since beauty  the beast have animated characters had so much life to them  even without the voices  they act  the musical number in paris is a showstopper  with some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style  as with all recent animated features  there are songs  however  these songs do more than just provide fodder for top40 singers to get on the radio  although there are three of them during the end credits   the songs are all very catchy  and advance the plot  instead of just being showpieces  except for the paris number  but thats so much fun  its okay      i cant reccomend anastasia highly enough  its a wonderful film that ranks right up there with other animated classics  kids and adults alike will enjoy it  and its also nice to have a quality animated feature film from another studio besides disney  
1	gothic murdermystery yarns are not a new conceit  in fact  theyve been around in books and on film for many  many years  without the proper handling  they come off as oldfashioned  bland  and outdated    the gift   directed by sam raimi  is a triedandtrue effort that surprises very little  and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings  to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front  to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond  its fairly obvious who the killer is  in fact  i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions  the film ultimately shouldnt work  but it does  thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances  the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other  annie wilson  cate blanchett  is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown  some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale  hilary swank   who is severely abused by her husband donnie  keanu reeves   and buddy cole  giovanni ribisi   an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares hes been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father  for annie  she does not give the readings merely for money  but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyones future  her late grandmother  rosemary harris  told her as a child that it was a gift she was given  and she should always remember that  when annies eldest son is involved in a fight at school  she meets the niceguy school principal  wayne collins  greg kinnear   whom she finds herself attracted to  but wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king  katie holmes   whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about  at a party with her best friend linda  kim dickens   annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan  gary cole   soon after  jessica has disappeared  leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her  and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale  and the pond behind his home    the gift  may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level  but the performances and tight direction from raimi  who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film  1999s  for love of the game   lift the picture up several notches  slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights  the disappearance of jessica at the 30minute mark divulges the movies true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut  at times frightening  horrormystery  at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett  1999s  the talented mr  ripley    who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a runofthemill protagonist into a very exact  downtoearth  realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her  blanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it  giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had  we follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing  both as a character and an actress  blanchett isnt the only bright performer  as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year  in her first role following her oscar win for 1999s  boys dont cry   hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie  who seeks guidance from annie  but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all  to leave the grossly abusive donnie  as donnie  keanu reeves  2000s  the watcher   makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie  so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all  for the oftencriticized reeves  whose acting abilities have never been the best  this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get  and it is also one of the better performances he has given  giovanni ribisi  2000s  the boiler room   is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend  and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad  in the small  but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king  katie holmes  2000s  wonder boys   has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn  her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before  and she is radiant in her few scenes  finally  kim dickens  2000s  hollow man   makes her usual strong impression as annies spicy best friend  linda  the other notable aspect of  the gift  is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene its almost suffocating  thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski  and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young  the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent  but one that is filled with dread  helped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson  which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast   the gift  is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills  and offers up a fair share of chills  too  it may not be groundbreakingly original  but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its

1	seen december 28  1997 at 8  45 p  m  at the crossgates mall cinema 18  guilderland  ny   theater 8  with matt perreault and my sister jena for free  matt paid using prepaid passes   if theres ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches and non stop action  the james bond films are it  and if theres ever been a james bond film that not only proves this  but does so by pushing it to the extreme   tomorrow never dies  is it  opening sequences almost always make or break action films  when done properly  not only are they actually exciting  but they foreshadow things to come  this film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie  but with a sense of the selfaware  enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in  first theres a hightech  slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly  chinese waters  theres definite tension as there seems to be an unknown  but certainly hostile  third party involved who is manipulating both sides  when the scene ends in tragedy  its clear theres some kind of powerful conspiracy going on  and who else to call on for such a case but james bond  the film uses good judgment in the way it introduces us to bond  brosnon   as the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious  bond is clearly  and obviously  depicted as an outandout hero  he singlehandedly takes out a small army of terrorists  and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the copilot tries to strangle him and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down  this might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for  over  using  but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly  its not about the payoff because its obvious bond will escape  instead  its the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it  all the while creating for witty  hysterical comedy  it seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore  because of political correctness  and just plain coppingout on behalf of the filmmakers  even the term  villain  sounds passe   what the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create a villain as heinous as they come  yet making him seem completely plausible  jonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as the arrogant  cunning elliot carver  a media mogul whose goal is to take over the world  that is  through his massive media empire  not through nuclear weapons  through some interesting detective work  bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create and accurately cover his own news  not only is that an original idea for a conflict  but one which could carry over into reality  surprisingly  this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become  the films hook is the action  and of course those cool gadgets and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver and finds himself in a jam or two along the way  the story works much like bond himself  always on the run and concentrates more on the individual conflicts than any general plot  somehow a chinese agent  wai lin  yeoh   bumps into bond a few too many times and they find themselves working together  the chemistry between brosnon and yeoh is rigid  but also works because of this  not in spite of it  the two are constantly on the run from carver and his goons  yet the film manages to balance the stunts and special effects with its clever story  although  tomorrow never dies  is far from perfect  it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche and cartoony and not make plausibility an issue

0	house on haunted hill  1999  starring taye diggs  geoffrey rush  ali larter  famke janssen  peter gallagher  bridgette wilson  max perlich  lisa loeb  james marsters  and chris kattan  directed by william malone  written by dick beebe    house on haunted hill  initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombielike mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible  one doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck  a nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water  these mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous bhorror flicks  with grunting noises and cadaverous movements  except this time  at the end of the millenium  the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be  in past horror films  the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims    house on haunted hill  doesnt want their audience to have an imagination  everything is provided for them to watch and squirm  not think  this nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film    house on haunted hill   which is based on the 1958 film of the same title  introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can  following the opening blood fest  the film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot  the aim here is to scare the audience with chilling  unexpected shots of blood  guts  and mayhem  however  the film is neither scary nor unpredictable  the plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner  geoffrey rush   each character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money  since the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring  the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them  the problem is that every character is not likable  the two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer  taye diggs  who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent  and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized  ali larter   the characters presented are so annoying and pathetic  that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them  the worst character in this film  or maybe in any film released this year  is chris kattans watson pritchett  he spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating and inappropriate  that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself  waiting for pritchett to die  was a strenuously difficult act to sit through  the most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price  an homage to victor price who starred in the original   playing the rich man who supposedly organized the party  he plays the role perfectly in a twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face  however  rush is pretty much wasted in a confusing subplot involving a hateful marriage with evelyn price  played by famke janssen  the main problem is that  house on haunted hill  is not scary  to top off that huge disappointment  every actor was wasted and the script was completely ludicrous  if the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were intentionally underdeveloped  similar to  deep blue sea    the goal for creating a creepy  suspenseful action film was completely missed  
0	in the past  tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman  and the hilarious ed wood  but lately his films just dont cut it  sleepy hollow has some unique features  but the script is a terrible mess  for those who remember disneys fantastic  adventures of ichabod crane   it is actually superior to this  disneys version was at least interesting  while burtons film drags on far too long  without any suspense or frights  while the stories are similar  the new version adds too much to the once likable story  and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off  ichabod crane  johnny depp  is now apparently a constable  who was sent to new york to investigate suspicious murders  the victims are headless  and no traces of evidence were found  until the murderer reveals himself  hence the headless horseman  now with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy  they must stop the headless horseman from a killing spree  that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow  sure the headless horseman is an intriguing character  but the story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster  in the original  the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable  no one could stop him  not even ichabod  by the end of the film  it had audiences in deep thought  burton however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere  and how to make the main characters heroes  he takes no risk what so ever  and this is where he fails  another pathetic element of the film was the script  like i said earlier  he just stuffed too much in at one time  and made it look real sloppy  kind of like the mess the headless horseman made with his victims  he completely butchered the story to pieces  thankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked  the acting by depp was quite notable  he took the nerdy character of the cartoon  and simply acted it out in a better manner  if it wasnt for his quirky oneliners  i doubt i could have remained awake  because quite frankly i was getting sleepy  just when i thought christina ricci was getting to be a good actress  she winds up doing this  it just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up a big blockbuster  its too tempting to let go  even if the script is mush  the atmosphere too was quite involving  i should have just gazed at the sets  and the eerie fog  rather than actually pay attention to what was going on  at least burtons films are eye candy  even if they are trash  the only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads  and the fight between the horseman  depp and casper van dien  other than that  i wish i could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film  and just sit back and stare at the scenery  by the end  i can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed  this is the biggest disappointment of the year  especially when such a talented director like burton handles a project like this  dont waste your time or money  because your head will feel hollow  
0	attention moviegoers  you are about to enter a meaningfree zone  should the sound system malfunction during your viewing of 200 cigarettes  do not panic  the film will work just as well as a silent movie  chronicling the meaningless lives of vain  yuppie types  the movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films  last days of disco  barcelona and metropolitan  but without any of his acerbic wit and the inviting style of his writing  firsttime writer shana larsen makes the mistake of creating a couple of dozen characters and not giving any of them any depth  there isnt one of these characters worth caring about  the movie features such a cornucopia of hot young stars that it looks like a celluloid version of  people magazine   among others  the movie features  ben affleck  casey affleck  david chappelle  janeane garofalo  gaby hoffmann  catherine kellner  courtney love  jay mohr  martha plimpton  christina ricci and paul rudd  and unlike people magazine  the people speak  not that they have anything interesting to say  its new years eve in 1981  and monica  martha plimpton  is preparing her big party  structured as a series of relatively unrelated stories about her guests on the way to the party  director risa bramon garcia flits back and forth among her stars  monicas apartment is in  noho   an area that one of the guests describes as  so cool  all of the poor people live there   typical of the shallow couples in the movie are kevin  paul rudd  and his friend and wouldbe sexual partner lucy  courtney love   they argue about whether lucy is a slut or not since she sleeps with everyone  except him  of course  she dares him to go immediately to a bathroom stall and have sex with her  which turns out to be neither erotic  funny or successful  rather like the rest of the story  the movie gets its title from the carton of cigarettes that lucy gives kevin for his new years eve birthday    cigarettes are a shield against emotional interaction with other people   kevin later tells lucy in a snippet of dialog that sounds profound only outside the context of the movie  another character  played by jay mohr  has a problem with his sexual triumphs  every woman he beds falls deeply in love with him by the next morning  when his latest conquest tells him of her affection for him  his response is  i like a lot of people   as the movie finally draws to a close  the characters awaken from their postparty game of musical beds  some have passed out early from alcohol abuse and remember little  while others actually have some clue as to what happened  the movie itself is so forgettable that by the time you reach your car in the parking lot  all trace of the film will have vanished from your mind  which is probably the best thing that can be said about the movie  200 cigarettes runs 1  40  it is rated r for profanity  sex and one dope smoking scene and would be acceptable for older teenagers  
0	my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love  i love ralph fiennes  i love uma thurman  i love sean connery  hell  im even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw  i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago  and ive been eagerly awaiting the film ever since  a few months into the summer  however  i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times  and that it had ended up in the midaugust dumping ground  then  in this final week before its official release  i learned that it was not to be screened for critics  and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs  and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique  my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things  the film i saw today didnt even meet those expectations  this is a lousy  incoherent mess  i would slam it harder  if it werent for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine  lovable actors  but sets are ultimately empty  and the performances are completely uninspired  thats the main problem with the avengers  for all its hiphop flash and tidal waves  none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired  its like a chore  a bland exercise in superhero film making  it also feels like its been cut to pieces  clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots  this is just plain depressing  the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show  frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that ive never watched an episode  i wasnt alive then  i dont even watch television now  im very sorry that i dont have this perspective  but  judging from the reviews ive already read  knowing the tv show just makes matters worse  i didnt know and love john steed and emma peel  and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles  i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film  based on what the film told me  i gather that steed  fiennes  is some kind of british super guy  somewhat like james bond   and that dr  peel  thurman  is just a really smart doctor  who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits  they are to work together  under mothers orders  mother is played by jolly jim broadbent  while his coconspirator  father  is played by the equallytalented fiona shaw   it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather  his name is de wynter  connery   he is a crazy scottish guy  our heroes had better stop him  or else      the weather will keep getting colder until they  have to go to hell to warm up   one of the films few funny lines   along the way there is subplot after subplot  hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere  feel perfunctory  and ultimately make no sense  for example  our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos  now  killer bugs dont really go with the weathercontrolling theme of the film  the purpose of the bugs  other than to annihilate our heroes  is never established  theyre never even directly connected to de wynter  theyre controlled by his crazy henchman  played by eddie izzard   the special effects arent bad  but theyre loud  obnoxious  and intrusive  like so many scenes in the film  it seems present only to keep your attention from waning  and i guarantee you  it will wane  i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didnt do any good to think  the avengers has clearly been chopped up and reassembled so many times that even the people involved couldnt tell us what happens  there are several scenes in the preview that didnt make the final cut  in addition  many of the sequences have irritating  grainy film quality  which makes it feel lowbudget  the last scene is particularly bad   the scenes that dont feature action should be electric  thanks to our wonderful cast  they arent  the action scenes should be electric  because this is an action film  they arent  either  and what about this wasted cast  oh  it makes me weep with disappointment  were talking ralph fiennes here  one of the best actors working today  one of the best actors  ever   i love the guy  ive loved all his films  until this one  he seems like he wants to understand the film  but hes as lost as we are  and thurman  in all of her spectacular beauty and talent  cant manage to look at home here    i dont blame her completely  for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way  and it cant be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting   connery  however  seems the most out of it  totally lacking any kind of focus  or interest  for that matter  who is to blame  is it the screenwriter  don macpherson  perhaps  although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right  is it the actors  for gods sake  no  these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling  i blame director jeremiah chechik  who shouldnt have been given the task to begin with  his best film  benny  joon  is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be  but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor  add to that a lack of experience in bigbudget action  and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory  if the avengers has a saving grace  its the set design  the sets  by stuart craig  are big  colorful  and often pleasing to look at  i like the final setpiece  on de wynters island  even if none of it makes a bit of sense  i admired the overhead view of the stairs  showing dr  peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere  i also enjoyed michael kamens music score  particularly in the opening credits  but this stuff is routine  good sets and music are nice  but theres a lot more that needs to be here  inspiration  for instance  would have been really nice  maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story  or a sense of purpose  most of all  though  i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles  damn this movie for not giving them the chance  
0	theres a good  and timely  story trapped deep within the excess of murder in the first  a new movie about the abuses of our prison system  with a country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime issue and the rights of the accused and the incarcerated in jeopardy  this expose would offer something rare to recent american moviesa point of view  but director marc rocco makes it clear from the beginning that pretentious  often nauseating  camera movements and slick  mtv style lighting and editing are far more important  theres not a moment in the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling  and everything suffers  christian slater and kevin bacon star as defense attorney and alcatraz inmate  respectively  after spending an unprecedented amount of time in an isolated cell for attempting to escape  bacon murders another prisoner and faces trial  his young lawyer  slater  is fresh out of law school but determined to  put alcatraz on trial  for the abuses of it warden  gary oldman   the result is the usual courtroom theatrics imagine a stanley kramer production shot by hyperactive film school students  theres very little to praise here outside of kevin bacons earnest overacting and the appropriate story  theres a lot of overacting from everyoneyou know youre in trouble right away when r  lee ermey  the drill sergeant in full metal jacket  is cast as a judge  the center of reason and moderation  slater has never been convincing and certainly isnt here and oldman is on a bad streak of hammy performances  but the worst feeling you get while watching murder in the first is that the man behind the camera could care less about telling a good story  there are long exchanges of dialogue where the camera is not even moving near the characters  let alone with them  how frustrating it must be for actors to work under these conditions  if theres anything that has alway distinguished american films over the rest of the world  it is our ability to tell a good story  have we forgotten  
0	forget get carter  instead    get me a cup of coffee  what the hell has happened to all good american action movies  did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere  when did all of the badass  kicking butt and taking names  guntoting  crazed  vengeful characters of the 1980s  from such films as commando  cobra  predator  raw deal  first blood  suddenly turn into innocent  compassionate  sensitive  tearyeyed knuckleheads  the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east  and i dont mean new york city  get carter  the latest masterpiece from uberthespian sylvester stallone  is a prime example of large and in charge 80s action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown  stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up  a few years ago  stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey  that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland  a strange film about redemption within a broken soul  stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past  too bad get carter returns stallone to action  but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges  get carter is a simple story  stallone plays frank carter  a vegas bruiser for a loan shark  played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore   when franks brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident  frank  feeling all guilty and mushy inside  thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented  carters way   he talks tough with his brothers wife  lends a helping had to his brothers daughter doreen  rachel leigh cook   and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee  carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultracool  mcqueenesque mickey rourke  a multimillionaire computer geek  alan cumming   and a strange foreign guy  michael caine  who speaks in riddles and talks tough  carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties  what a minute  this sounds just like another film i saw last year  the limey  better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off  actually  get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name  starring caine in the title role  and what with his cameo here  the cleverness is astonishing   while stallone still carries his own weight here  the movie lacks what the original did as well  purpose  throughout the film  stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough  while nobody is taking him seriously  his oneliners fall flat  and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions  mental and physical  required of his character  there is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations  in both fists and words  the biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke  an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs  spousal abuse  a boxing career  and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way  rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character  he may not win any oscars  but he still ranks highly in my book  get carter has great directing  strong acting by rourke and caine  and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud  the only thing it lacks  as with most hollywood productions  is a good script and proper casting  never mind that it should never have been made at all  
0	i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor  an innocuousenoughonthesurface romantic comedy  its not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity  but there it was nonetheless  i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999  in a word  its the same thing thats wrong with so many movies circa 1999  writing  more to the point  its the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when youre telling a story about a relationship  the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where were expected to get dewyeyed over any pairing of attractive  pleasant people just because theyre attractive and pleasant  in this particular case  attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon  chris odonnell   a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage  its a scary notion for jimmy  even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne  renee zellweger   his girlfriend of three years  convinced despite his reservations that its time to  sh  t or get off the pot   jimmy proposes to anne  very badly  anne refuses  which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather  peter ustinov  dies and leaves a very specific video will  jimmy stands to inhereit 100 million if he is married by 6  05 p  m  on his 30th birthday  stays married for 10 years and produces a child  there are only a couple of minor problems  1  jimmys 30th birthday is the next day  2  anne is nowhere to be found  meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many exgirlfriends  its a wacky  brewsters millionsesque premise  acknowledged as such in one of the films better  more selfaware lines of dialogue   the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters  at least that would be the case if jimmy werent already a worldclass altruist  screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will  if jimmy doesnt get married  not only will he lose all the money  but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him  costing hudreds of jobs  from the outset  jimmys motivation isnt cash  its the livelihoods of his devoted employees  its almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelors plot development  by any human standard  the guy is impossibly selfless  and thats the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor  the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness  theres never any tension between the two starcrossed lovers  because theres no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake  the blandly nice odonnell couldnt pull off a randy cad if he tried  so the filmmakers dont even let him  zellwegers anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to  but no one dares make her anything but the woman  lightly  wronged  and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation  the parade of sitcom set pieces had better be damned funny  since theyre all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion  ill admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing  including ustinovs rantings about procreation and a restaurant fulltobursting with men popping questions and champagne corks  far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly  like the shudderinducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortunehunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church  youre never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor  but thats not the real problem  nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warmnfuzzy conclusion its leading up to  the problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warmnfuzzy  theres no spark  no energy  no humanity  its an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumers digestions  weve reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment dont even have a pulse  the bachelor is love among the mannequins

1	some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing  that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies  that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find  to their big surprise  that the majority of people vote republican  go to church every sunday and usually dont tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film  such rude awakening  however  can happen in another direction  conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in  something like that happens to jake van dorn  george c  scott   successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community  one day his daughter kristen  ilah davis  disappears from calvinist youth convention in california  van dorn is worried because he doesnt believe that his daughter would run from home  however  the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast  peter boyle  is even harder  kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film  infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way masts investigation is going  so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself  unfortunately  he lacks experience and the quest  that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld  is fruitless  things change when he devises cunning plan and  while doing it  stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky  season hubley   almost two decades after its release  hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars  it is a real shame  because very few movies in todays hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt  in late 1970s  it was totally different situation  films were expected to have mature  serious themes for the mature audience  for schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work  taxi driver  one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s  on one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great  but that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and  instead of facing them  prefers to live in rural  conservative cocoons  the new america  on the other hand  fares no better  ideals of the socalled  sexual revolution   same as all other  revolutions  of the swinging sixties  degraded into exploitation and depravity  instead of being  liberated   baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms  schrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas  actually  arent so far away  nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn  already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist  meets sleazy porno producer  the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian  paternalistic and very dedicated to this job  the difference between the two is simply in the line of work  many contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda  on the surface  it may look that way  audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest  in the first scenes  he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesnt deserve to experience parents worst nightmare  the scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristens fate is extremely cruel  pain and humiliation  brought by oscarwinning actor george c  scott  is of such intensity  that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda  van dorn is perhaps flawed  and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end  but the viewers simply know that his cause is just  and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body  on the other hand  schrader  who grew up in an environment very much like van dorns  his own parents wouldnt allow him to watch movies until he was 18   knows better and tries to bring another side of coin  even the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities  like nicky  who actually tries to improve her life  and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end  unfortunately  schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning  and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich  d finale  the script is slightly flawed  and schrader as director doesnt show too much originality  his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver  apart from the scenes in grand rapids  those two films even look alike  but the content might be more than interesting for todays viewer  especially those inspired by the current 70s revival  until boogie nights  no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s  hardcore  on the other hand  might serve as precious document  because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs  before the advent of video  when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists  the view of such age and the industry is very unflattering  though  but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience  that shouldnt be too surprising  anyway  despite some flaws  hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema  
1	when i saw the trailer for this film  i laughed harder than i had in quite some time  while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it  i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good  im happy to say that theres something about mary is not one of those trailer letdowns  in fact  watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours  the film opens up in flashback to 1985  at a high school in cumberland  rhode island  ted stroehmann  ben stiller  is a social reject who cant seem to get a date to the upcoming prom  until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren  w  earl brown   whos being harassed by one of the school jocks  it seems warrens sister is the campus queen  mary jensen  cameron diaz   who is impressed with teds willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother  despite a very real chance of getting beaten up  mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom  ted was just flattered that she even knew his name  unfortunately  prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper  at which every man in the theater will wince   and is sent to the hospital  fast forward to the present  where ted has cleaned himself up  now writes for a magazine  but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years  mary  whom he hasnt seen since that fateful day  with the help of his friend dom  chris elliott   ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy  matt dillon  to track down his only love  however  when pat finds mary  he falls for her too  and soon the both of them are competing for her affections  theres something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly  who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin  not exactly intelligent comedies  they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or coworkers to think you had such a great time watching them  with their current film  the farrelly brothers have come up with something youll not only enjoy  but also wont mind talking about the next day at the water cooler  the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles  from the subtle to the ridiculous  and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some  seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers last two films  they almost all work  i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on  one minute youll be laughing at something ted says  and the next youll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of marys apartment  one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller  he is perfectly cast in the role of ted  because hes a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation  teds a nice fellow and tries to do his best  but for some reason or another things just dont always work out  its comical  but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top  actually  ive liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mideighties  the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruisepaul newman film the color of money  entitled the hustler of money  in it  stiller played wince  not vince  who is taken under the wing of an older man  played by john mahoney  to become a bigtime bowling hustler  it was parody at its finest  more of which showed up in the shortlived  the ben stiller show  on the fox network in late 92early 93  like  the critic   which aired on abc  then fox   i still mourn that shows cancellation  cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film  although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates  and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paperthin at times  however  diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm  that you can still see why shes got guys just falling over each other to be with her  heck  i even found her laugh to be cute  even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week  my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesnt change  and you know  its really true  he and ralph macchio must hang out or something  maybe they live in dick clarks pool house  anyway  heres another good piece of casting  as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into marys heart  the supporting performances are also good  chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss  yes  check it out next time   and less annoying than in cabin boy  lin shae  who plays marys neighbor magda  and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin   provides some good laughs  especially in scenes with her benjilike dog  which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film  lee evans  as marys friend tucker  displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist  the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j  strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there arent any noticeable times where the film drags  the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes  they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plotrelevant information right toward the camera  its a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film  after that it got a little annoying  and its unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow  fortunately  filled with sight gags  humorous lines  and solid comedic acting  theres something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater  
0	  return to horror high   wants to be a couple different types of movies at once  the film tells the story of a lowbudget horror movie being filmed at the closeddown crippen high  a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before  but what the cast and crew dont know is that a real killer  maybe the same one that was never apprehended  is going into action again  on one level   return to horror high  is a slasher movie  and it is at this level that it works the best on  watching the film  which was made in 1987  i couldnt help but take notice that the killers costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in   scream   and  scream 2   on another level  the film wants to be a slapstick comedy  and there are many hints of this throughout  unfortunately  most of these jokes fall flat  and the last thing the film wants to be is a  behindthescenes  look at an exploitation film being made  the only problem is that  while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made  no cameras are shown filming it  thus making it far more confusing than it had to be  and to top it all off  the  twist  ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever  and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time  there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous  and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through  if you see the film  or have seen it  youll know what i mean  the premise of  return to horror high   is admittedly pretty crafty  and i liked the atmosphere of the school  which is where the whole thing takes place  but director froehlich  judging from this movie  is an incompetent director  except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene  well  come to think of it  there is only one scene that is actually scary  and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in  but other than that twominute distraction   return to horror high   is certainly no great shake  note  look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film  and strangely enough  he is the first character to get the ax    literally  
1	david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director  with his distinctive  more often than not ingenious dialogue  and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible  some of them tend to be thickly layered  deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message  or sometimes even a concealed storyline  and although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors  it is still a brilliantly complex  consistently riveting motion picture about honor  about sacrifice  and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right  oh  and its rated g  incidentally  this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone elses work  namely a play by terrence rattigan  set in the 19th century  he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow  a rich  aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note    did you do it   he asks his boy    no father  i didnt   ronnie answers  thats enough for arthur  who  with his oldest daughter  rebecca pidgeon   immediately starts a crusade to bring his sons case to court  they enlist the help of sir robert morton  a notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task  it all seems fairly frivolous  and no matter how you look at it  the winslow case is not the trial of the century  but arthur is determined to keep his familys word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that  soon enough  sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings  so do we  all david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue  but his style is still fairly apparent  the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense  but this is not mamets norm  and its refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks  gangsters as con men  wonderful as those films were  nigel hawthornes performance is nearly flawless  his delivery is that of a dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game  we pity the man  but we also like him  rebecca pidgeon  david mamets wife  who gave a fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthurs oldest daughter  a flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as a way for making up for her lack of success in the womens suffrage movement  the winslow boy is a wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as a seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher  it wants to make a real impact rather than a phony one  be honest  did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like a time to kill  if you wanted to but didnt  this is a movie for you  it is the epitome of subtlety  its powerful without being too emotional  sad without even trying to be depressing  david mamet can churn out some great scripts  but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is a hell of a director too  he is almost a national treasure  his films deserve their own genre    1999 eugene novikov137  
1	jake kasdan  son of one of the best screenwriters around  breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hardtocategorize detective story  part mystery  part comedy  part character study and part romance  for the most part  kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film  daryl zero  bill pullman  is a modern day sherlock holmes  the parallel is present down to his love of music  though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin   and his addiction to drugs  amphetamines  rather than morphine   he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces  the case about the man who lied about his age  or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes  however zeros observance of the fine art of detachment  though it makes him a brilliant private investigator  makes him somewhat of a selfimposed outcast in society  he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr  watson  i mean steve arlo  ben stiller   arlo is not happy with his job  he is thrilled to be around zeros brilliance  but his bizarre behavior  and strange requests  are frustrating to the former lawyer  and theyre even more so to his girlfriend  jess  angela featherstone   who is fed up that her boyfriends boss means more to arlo than her  this is the situation when a new case comes knocking  gregory stark  ryan oneill  hires zero to find his lost keys  it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring  and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence  now  stark is being blackmailed  and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end  to solve this case  zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell  however  this is when he is vulnerable    and this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic  gloria sullivan  kim dickens   who may be involved in the blackmail scheme  for the first time  zero has to question his own objectivity  as he finds his client less and less sympathetic  zero effect is weakest in its obviously  wacky  scenes depicting daryl zeros odd behavior  such scenes might be appropriate in an outandout satire  making zero an ace venturaish character  however  theres a much meatier movie in here    it just takes a while to get out  thats not to say that theres not a place for humor in this film  in fact  some of the best scenes are ben stillers wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer  however  the overthetop scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film  and they arent funny enough to stand on their own  once the investigation is underway  however  zeros brilliance really begins to shine  his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlocks own  as the mystery begins to unfold  zeros deductions lead the plot in interesting directions  but never lose the viewer  zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well  zeros relationship with gloria is lowkey  but it hits all the right notes  however  we are always kept distant from glorias character  shes given plenty of development  but we never understand what she is thinking  perhaps that may be intentional  to place the audience in zeros zone of detachment  but  on the whole  it is frustrating  bill pullman  when hes not spacing out  creates a vibrant character in daryl zero  theres one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years  and it is shockingly moving    expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character  but one which fits in well  and  although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called  zero  seriously  it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name  although zero effect is a bit awkward in places  it is a strong debut for kasdan  and shows great promise  
0	there  s nothing quite like a gory anime  really  and this is the truth  no other genre in film gets away with such violence without a word being said in the media about it  with anime  a common shot is watching a body getting quickly cut in two  and the rest of the insides falling out seconds afterword  this is a standard practice in anime  or at least the half dozen or so titles that i  ve seen  vampire hunter d is a gory  gory film  if they ever made a live version of the film  it would be banned in several countries and given a rating somewhere below xxx  it  s not that it  s gore is unique  it  s just like other gory animes  but this one was supposed to stand out because of the complexity it  s story  characters  animation  etc    it really didn  t  it was disgusting and gruesome  which overshadowed the story  what little of it there was  it seems that in the not too distant future vampires and evil control the world  because god knows that our local police force just can  t seem to get a handle on vampires in the movies  one evening  a blond peasant girl  drawn to look 17 and innocent  a foreshadow that we will see her naked  i guessed early on it would be in the shower or in a rape scene  is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of a ten thousand year old vampire  insert strom thurmand joke here   of course  he never put a  no trespassing  sign on his yard  so one can  t really blame her  but he  s upset anyway and demands retribution  she gets the obligatory bite on the neck  aren  t there other places to get blood from  it seems like a bite in the elbow would do well enough  if its good enough for doctors to draw blood from  then why do vampires stray from that sight   to fight the spell  she enlists the help of a mysteriously tall  dark and handsome vampire hunter  you guessed it  his name is d   the vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires  being attracted to the 17 year old peasant girl and finding reasons not to talk too much  you see  like all heroes in these kinds of stories  he  s a brooder  who  s sole purpose in life is to remain really  really silent  when he speaks  it  s in cliches  heroes like this are bad when they  re live  even worse when animated  later the vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire  who wants to marry the peasant girl because he  s bored after 10  000 years of living  the only clever vampire insight made in the movie   will vampire hunter d rush to save her in time  will we see blood and intestines spattering on every place imaginable  in it  s defense  the animation  when focusing on being original rather than recycling anime slicing  could at times be original  the talking hand was clever  and i think the inspiration for a skateboardrelated logo  and that  s the best defense i can think of  i understand that vampire hunter d is supposed to be a fave among anime fans  but i really don  t see it  it  s an excuse to watch blood dripping from teeth  blood exploding out of eye sockets and horses necks  and most importantly  like all violent anime  it is an excuse to see animated breasts  why  what is the point of that  maybe i have to understand the genre and look past the obsessive gore and mysogny  i  m not a prude  i just don  t think it  s warranted  it puts itself so far out in front of the movie that everything else gets lost  is there a neccesity in seeing a 17 year old in the shower  of course not  it  s done for shock  it  s tasteless and despicable  
0	bats is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan  to pull something like this off  you need to have a sense of wit and style  with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines  something like the underground worm thriller tremors had just the perfect mixture of these elements  and in return  the film was tremendous fun  with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player  bats mainly plays its premise for straightarrow horror  judging by the ridiculous premise  this was not exactly a wise move  the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcocks the birds  but fails miserably  done right  it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema  unfortunately  bats is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly  terribly wrong  the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be  i will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom bats is aimed toward  those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats  these bats are not very nice  because they eat a lot of people  boy  are these bats ugly  they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them superduper smart  theyve got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all  a whole bunch of people in texas get killed  so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats  they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with  but the bats are pretty smart  so its sorta hard to do  the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good  but no  bats is probably too violent for preschoolers  the film  directed by louis morneau  should have ventured straight into video stores  on the small screen  perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations  but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward  although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure  the film is poorly written  poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude  even the bats themselves are cheesy  and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed  the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey  lou diamond phillips   who embodies every pathetic stereotype a smalltown authority figure usually portrays  he chomps on a cigar  struts contentedly in his boots  etc      the scientist is dr  sheila casper  dina meyer   who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as the best in her field  meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable  but everything about dr  casper is recycled beyond recognition  her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hoopers tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in jaws  everything revolving around bats is tired drivel  which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up  the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw  with voices dubbed in later  in fact  that may have worked out better in the end  take one glance at caspers batloathing sidekick jimmy  leon   and youll have immediate deja vu  hes the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie  constructed specifically for timed comic relief  unfortunately  none of his comic interludes are funny  in the role of deranged mad scientist dr  mccabe  the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch  mccabe accidentally released two experimental test subjects  and the virus spread to other bats  the entire town of gallup  texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures  but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else  something like  when is the damn movie going to be over   i just want my money   the bats are ugly  i must say  theres the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing  but mainly  the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery  only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been  but by the absurdly stupid climax  its way too late in the game for a decent recovery  characters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire  lets explore the logic there  is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population   you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one  and after that there are only 18  000 more of them  this kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind bats

0	i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard  the problem is  i cant remember them as i write this review  thats not a good sign  in booty call  jamie foxx is bunz  a character whom i cant really describe  because i dont know that much about him  i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk  and that he doesnt like relationships  just  booty calls  at three in the morning  no questions  no commitment   bunz has a best friend named rushon  tommy davidson   who seems to be bunzs direct opposite  on the straight and narrow  and currently in a longterm commitment  a whole seven weeks  wow    rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend  nikki  tamala jones   but for a reason which is not totally explained  its going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikkis friend lysterine  vivica a  fox   who have never met  to make a long story short  the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikkis obsession with safe sex  first she wants condoms  so bunz and rushon go out and get them  oh  no  they have to be latex  not lambskin  back to the store  now theyve got to get dental dams  or therell be no foreplay  why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand  nikki phones lysterine  who lives across the hall  and tells her shed better be making these demands  too  talk about coitus interruptus  booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those overthetop comedies  the difference between the two is that in the latter  things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality  in this category  for example  you have ace ventura  private eye on the mild side  and airplane  at the extreme  there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status  but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention  it is disappointing  and even worse  distracting  there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker  are those real names   does not live up to its potential  as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing  for instance  there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant  bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese  much to everyones surprise  however  when asked how he learned the language  he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from latenight kungfu films  and soon gained mastery  this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene  if  on the other hand  when asked how he learned to speak chinese  bunz simply replied with   kungfu movies   and then moved on  the joke would have been much more effective  this is because it would have been totally unbelievable  but funny because we know it is unbelievable  by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible  the film is not giving its viewers enough credit  the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions  why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends  why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine  if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex  why doesnt she have some condoms at her own apartment  these questions are not answered by the screenplay  but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward  a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language  some movies use a lot of swear words  but use them under very justifiable circumstances  as when they are employed consistent with a characters pattern of speech  other films  such as the recent jackie brown  use them in ways that almost parody themselves  booty call just sticks them in to get laughs  and it doesnt work  they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them  half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason  the chinese restaurant  a holdup at a convenience store  and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story  and are in there for filler  this is surprising  considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long  its too bad that the core of the film isnt much better  since it is comprised of sometimes funny  but forgettable dialog  i refer you to the first paragraph of this review  
1	showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven  director  and joe eszterhas  writer  their last effort  basic instinct  played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock  with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curryspiced tabasco sauce  a dish not to everyones taste  but certainly a wellcrafted movie  possibly that movies greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage  prior to the movie  during the movie  and after the movie    and that  after bringing all the plotlines together neatly  it left the viewer with full knowledge of what  would  happen in the characters future  so there was no need to film it  there was actually about four hours worth of screen story there  but eszterhas found ways to get it all onscreen in two  by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on  and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails  the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls  we have attractive  sympathetic  but still highly repellent characters  we have shows for the eyes and the ears  plotlines that play on several levels  we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable  and we have a story of an innocent  who may not be so innocent  whos trying to play straight  trying to improve her station in life  who slips into behaving the way those around her do    but recovers with a flourish  and quits a winner  in this sense  the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven  whos not known for treating his characters well  but nomi  the part played by elizabeth berkley  definitely opts out of the game in a positive way  and were left feeling good about her future  this is not one of the great movies  but its far better than wed been led to expect by all the negative prerelease publicity  verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971  and in the last quartercentury has pushed farther and farther  experimenting with the sociallyacceptable limits to moviemaking  his most recent three movies  robocop  total recall  and basic instinct  have been a progression of backdoor access to american culture  moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives  and now hes exploring the sleeze  this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the directors contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie    verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating  although his original version is available on video   many reviewers have taken the politicallycorrect stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing  but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies  its about people in an environment where naked ladies are common  and why such an environment should exist  its about the scum who use other people as powertrip toys  and the need to escape their power  its about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values dont pertain  and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment  an nc17 movie which isnt sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty  power  or value  the one scene in the movie that  could  have been a good sex scene  berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool  is not exciting  because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator  if anything  its a rape scene with a victim whos been duped into cooperation  you dont make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors  you dont make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed  and you dont make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls    and in an awful lot of vegas shows  an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing  this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry  in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity  showgirls deglamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness  nomi is played  in a very good performance  by elizabeth berkley  who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents whos at the end of her rope  desperate to live a life better than the one shes known  she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability  and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker  trying to be something better than she seems destined to be  when nomi realizes shes gone too far for too little  she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be  gina rivera plays molly  a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi  providing her with what may be the one solid  positive relationship in nomis entire life  molly is the one who makes the difference  and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system shell be using for the rest of her life  and nomis feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomis decision  gina gershon plays cristal  an aging  but still very attractive starring dancer  a reflexively competitive manipulator whos become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her  gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch  a fading talent made bitter by selfawareness  her character is very well drawn and performed  in a major scene in a hospital room  she acknowledges what she is  and  in essence  passes the torch to nomi  the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie  and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path  it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe  molly is an honest  hardworking person who means well  and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality  cristal is a talented dancer whos compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a cooperating part of the system  exchanging selfrespect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas  nomi believes she can make it without selling herself  succumbs to a degree  and then realizes she can make it without selling herself  and doesnt need las vegas or its brand of  stardom   the male parts in this movie are simply props  they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist  kyle maclachlan  whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden  gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs  camouflaged as a nice guy  glenn plummer plays a dancer whos working as a bellboy  and provides a bit of alternate perspective  plummers character is the only one in the movie whos maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art  but even hes succumbed to the cult of manipulation  plummers character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie  some of jost vacanos cinematography is fantastic  and one particular delineation of nomis character alteration  a nodialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting  is utterly terrifying  this movie is rated nc17 due to language  sexual situations  full frontal nudity  violence  and probably the costuming as well  i dont see a way this particular story could have been told well without it  and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in moviemaking  but dont go see it if youre not in a tough mood  the only person its possible to like in this movie ends up in an i  c  u  on life support  and there is probably not one character in this movie youd enjoy meeting in person  
0	im going to start this review off with a hypothetical question  lets say youve just been in a car accident  and the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious  your friends have left to go get help  and youre waiting to see if the victim wakes up  a towtruck comes along  and the driver hops out of the truck to see whats going on  he then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck  do you  a  run away screaming for your life  staying away from the main road  b  run away  but not too fast  and stay on the main road even when the madman in the truck starts following you   stop  to catch your breath  try to negotiate with the psycho  and when that fails  start running away again  all the while  staying on the main road   if you answered  a   you are far more intelligent than the screenwriter of  texas chainsaw massacre  the next generation  and will likely hate this movie  however  if you answered  b   prepare to enjoy a film made with idiots like you in mind    texas chainsaw massacre  the next generation  is being called a sequel  but its really more of a remake of the original  theres a few changes here and there  but its essentially the same  even the infamous  meathook  scene has been recreated   the story opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom  and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere  needless to say  they soon encounter leatherface and his nutty family  much carnage ensues  to call this movie inept would be putting it mildly  in addition to the laughably idiotic situation i mentioned in my hypothetical question  there is a moment towards the end of the film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere  it just swoops down and kills him with its wheel  no explantion is given as to who was flying it or why heshe is going around killing people with the planes wheel  the dialogue is even more atrocious  zellwegger  who is kidnapped by  the family  early on  keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people  when youre surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws and dead corpses  i would think that rationality would go out the window  speaking of going out the window  there is a scene in which zellwegger jumps out a window  apparently  the stunt double had a little trouble  because she visibly gets stuck in the window  the director quickly cuts to a wide shot where the stunt double  doesnt  get caught in the window  this was one of many glaring inconsistencies  there are so many  in fact  that if i were to name them all  this review would be several pages long  the only reason i am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey  he plays a member of  the family  with a hydraulic leg  homemade  i might add  and is so completely overthetop  you cant help but be amazed by his performance  he obviously had a lot of fun with this part  and it really shows  he makes jack nicholsons portrayal of the psychotic inn keeper in  the shining  look restrained in comparison  for a horror movie   texas chainsaw massacre  the next generation  contains surprisingly little gore  in fact  in contains none  theres a little blood here and there  but thats as far as it goes  which leads me to believe that the budget must have been  astonishingly  low  and it shows  everything about the movie looks cheap  from the sets to the costumes  especially leatherface  once frightening and nightmare inducing  hes now as terrifying as dame edna  do yourself a favor and take a pass at this remake  check out the far superior original instead

1	the premise is simple  if not bizarre  a mad scientist  trace beaulieu as dr  clayton forrester  launches an averagejoe  michael j  nelson as mike nelson  into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made  why  its torturous  its maniacal  and its just plain fun  based on the cultfavorite cable television series  mystery science theater 3000  the movie isnt torturous  but as for being maniacal and just plain fun  it foots the bill quite nicely  mike nelson  on a dogbone shaped spacecraft  spends his days as any young man would dream  indulging in sarcasm and horseplay  and seeing quite a few movies  the catch is  these movies arent the movies he chooses  but retched examples of filmmaking chosen specifically by dr  forrester in an attempt to break mikes will to live  dr  forrester is convinced that one too many b movies is all it will take to ruin a man  but with a couple of wisecracking puppet buddies  tom servo  voiced by kevin murphy  and crow t  robot  voiced by beaulieu   the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema  the purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known  even if by very few of us  to man  we watch as the silhouettes of mike  tom  and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them  in this case  its the 1954 scifi film this island earth  we basically watch as our three leads watch  only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary  the plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant  but for the sake of those who might want to know  ill explain this one  this island earth is the tale of two scientists  a man and a woman  who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth  together the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet  to make mst3k work  the filmwithinthefilm naturally has to be as horrible as possible  and although the tvseries introduced us to several worse films than this island earth  its a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty  mst3k  which doesnt actually contain the complete this island earth  is a short 73 minutes  but this is a step very wisely taken  as funny as some of their observations are  it can only go so long  occasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously  although it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment  its better than overkilling the whole concept post haste  mst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly  but if you dont know what youre in for  it could be a jarring disappointment  although i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars  it is a movie to be seen on home video  late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway  and with a large  saracastic crowd  new years at midnight for example  which is when i saw it  warning  although mst3k has more to its end credits than most  the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun   they are actually more annoying than most  the name slandering and asinine oneliners were extremely unfunny  and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight  it put a heavy damper on the overall experience  most people will likely stay to see what the smartalecs have to say  but for me  it almost ruined an otherwise good film  
0	  spice world  is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls  sure theres a hint of humor in there every once in a while  actually  theres a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls  but overall  who cares  not me  if you dont know by now  the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power  yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood  in  spice world  they ride around in their big tour bus  whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews  amazingly  all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things  things they want to do  not things they are required to do to keep earning money  and they keep babbling about  girl power  when they should really be talking about  cleavage power   i mean  if all it takes is girl power  then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits  the film is pg  but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions  youd have yourself one raunchy adult film  by the way  theres something in the opening credits which says  based on an idea by the spice girls   wow  they got idea credit  i certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood    giving credit for simply having the thought  say girls  lets make a movie   the supporting cast fares well  roger moore  the real james bond  mockingly plays the clichespewing  chief  of the spice girls  and darn it all  hes fun to watch  mark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the bands manager  richard e  grant   one question though  george wendt  youd think that  spice world  would envoke one of two reactions in people  if you like the spice girls  youll like them even more afterwards  and if you cant stand them  like me   then  spice world  will really make you sick  oddly  the audience i saw the film with  roughly 50 twelve yearold girls  sat in silence for the entire film  well  not the two who sat directly behind me  they kept muttering  this is stupid  over and over again  maybe there is hope for humanity after all  pg 
0	some movies i should just skip  my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back  and here comes another disney effectsfilled liveaction flick based on an old tv program  true  the probgram is only 15 years old this time  and its a cartoon  but its a cartoon i liked  and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen  but my daughter really wanted to go  and how bad could it be  turns out i was right  mostly  inspector gadget  oddly enough  follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian  down to the jivetalking sidekick  at first i thought it was done by the same people  but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin  where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver  this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it  where  formula  isnt just business  its a way of life  the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits  in some parts you can just hear them saying  more zany  i want more zany here  and  here     lets have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here  make it really painful  i want the audience squirming in their seats     ok  thats fine  but i want you to add bug guts     what does this scene do  character depth  but wheres the zaniness  i dont see zany here  if you cant make it zany  cut it   the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie  michelle  who plays penny  gadgets niece  shines in every scene shes in  but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time  my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor  dabney colemans comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby  i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film  but instead  he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes  he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the  gidget bitch from hell  town mayor  oteris overly enthusiastic and continually selfcongratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland  oregons own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasnt poking fun at our fair town  or  maybe all career politicians are like that  i must say  matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla  he appears to have some fun with the film  especially as the evil gadget  rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw  joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself  her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film  d  l  hughley plays the shuckinandjivin vehicular sidekick  in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years  the dialog is    lets face it  its pretty bad  the tagline after a major setpiece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context  a lot of the lines  especially hughleys  appear to be made up as they go along  by people with little gift for adlib  about threequarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw  gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations  not really  battles   with the evil gadget  penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon  let me rage here just for a minute  michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character  shes utterly charming  and has excellent experience  harriet the spy  for the part of the pintsize detective  why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery  the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting  or editing  stupidity  inspector gadget is missing the long  long stretches of potty humor that  among other things  made my favorite martian so unbearable  but its a very short movie  so perhaps something was cut at the last moment  probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits  the  evil sidekick support group  is especially worth seeing  and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds its onscreen  all in all  another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films  i wonder if disney uses the revenues for its generally moneymaking cartoons to produce these losers  but if true  why  if theyre trying for another mary poppins  they need to find a team that can produce one  and then give them a chance to do it  
1	unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi  an artist whose palette is fabric  ostensibly  the film is a documentary  but use of that term requires stretching its meaning  many scenes appear staged  and a great deal of cuttingandpasting has been done in the editing room  the cinema verite effect is a conceit  genuine spontaneity is at a premium  and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera  especially wouldbe actresses like cindy crawford   director douglas keeve  who was mizrahis lover at the time  freely admits that he  couldnt care less about the truth  but was more interested in capturing  the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion   despite violating nearly every rule of  legitimate  documentary film making  however  unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment  while it sheds only a little light on the behindthescenes world of the fashion industry  it presents a fascinating  if incomplete  picture of designer mizrahi  this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study  hes funny  energetic  and eminently quotable  he has unusual views on just about everything  from fashion   its about women not wanting to look like cows   to mary tyler moore   between her and jackie kennedy  they shaped this country   to style   its almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs    unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress  its almost certainly different that anyone would imagine  the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look  including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies  then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection  in particular  unzipped traces mizrahis development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show  which highlights a number of prominent models  including cindy crawford  naomi campbell  kate bush  and linda evangelista  on the technical side  a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped  a variety of film stocks were used  super 8  16 mm blackandwhite  and 35 mm color  there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness  the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie  and  during the climactic fashion show  color is used to show the audiences perspective  while blackandwhite is for the behindthe scenes sequences  nevertheless  some viewers will be put off by this treatment  while unzipped isnt an expose on the fashion industry per se  keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear  overall  however  this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else  and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed  when the designer declares that  everything is frustrating except designing clothes  thats beautiful and liberating   it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed  
1	on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements  in case you missed it  warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail  he says to a black congregation     if you cant cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife  youre never gonna get rid of me    well  there is such a plot  and it works very well in this comedy  beatty plays jay billington bulworth  a longtime democratic senator from california  the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworths latest commercials condemning affirmative action  the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy  when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv  having gone without food or sleep for days  his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care  first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe  a 10 million life insurance policy in his daughters name  then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination  his assistant murphy  oliver platt  is oblivious to bulworths suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements  bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an africanamerican church  then takes questions from the audience  he is hit hard with questions about his voting record  he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots  and it hasnt shown up  since hes a dead man anyway  he figures hell answer truthfully  he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l  a  for the photo opportunity  they made some promises that improved their public image for a while  and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made  the shock and outrage from the congregation grows  the questions keep coming  and he keeps shooting back honest  if ugly  answers    before i go further  id like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make  and that is that characterizing africanamericans as maltliquor drinking o  j  fans is not part of bulworths  truth   that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie  when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics  this line is not what theyre talking about   the experience is liberating  with nothing left to lose  bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth  he can say whatever he wants because hes going to be dead anyway  why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician  that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists  and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism  bulworths candor wins him three volunteers from the church  one of whom  nikki  halle barry   he gets a crush on  he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something  chicken wings  appropriately enough  bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives  when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings  bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment  with so much money and so many talented people working so hard  he wonders  why cant hollywood make a quality product    you go  warren   when they become indignant and ask why hes talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product  he callously admits that its because they are rich jews  that night he drops the three africanamerican volunteers at their nightclub  and he decides to go in with them  he stays up all night drinking  smoking pot  dancing  falling in love with nikki  and learning to scratch turntables and rap  the next day  he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suitandtie fundraisers  from then on  at all of his political appearances  he raps his political truth  his rap is not bad for a middleaged white guy  hes not very good  but it is his first try and at least hes not embarrassingly bad  his lobbyists are not amused  but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth  eventually  the movies plot  remember he hired a hit man   overtakes the politics  which is too bad  screen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him  there are even a few gratuitous chase scenes  bulworth fleeing his killer  these scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along  but it distracted and detracted from bulworths political ranting  which was much more interesting than the everpresent  obviouslooking assassin  still  most of the movie is original and very enjoyable  and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen  as the story and screen writer  he came up first with a good structure  then with good dialogue to back it up  jeremy pikser cowrote the screenplay   as an actor  he was able to convincingly portray bulworths depression  then liberation and rebirth  as a producer  there were four others  he was able to keep the movie free from hollywoods indulgent formulas  except for those inexcusable chase scenes   someone else probably could have directed  but since he was there anyway  what the heck  its too bad that there arent more movies like this around  movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics  after all  much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news  just a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants  just dont expect to be popular with the insurance companies  
1	i can already feel the hate letters pouring in on this one  folks  i loved the wedding singer  but it gets worse  if i so much as mention titanic in the same sentence      hell  same paragraph as the wedding singer  im bound to be lynched  well lynch me then  because i thought adam sandler and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in recent memory  with titanic as the only exception  right away  youre ready to discount my review  arent you  youre thinking that i cant possibly know what im talking about  after all  this is adam sandler right    well  theres more      i actually got choked up  and more than once  yes  the man who brought us billy madison and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes  but before you shrug me off as an imbecile  i urge you to see the movie and see for yourself  the wedding singer is the story of robby hart  sandler   a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life has been performing cover tunes at wedding receptions for the past five years or so  but when his own wedding results in a noshow for the bride  angela featherstone as linda   robby begins to reexamine his life  and wonder why true love doesnt exist for people like him  in the process of performing at these receptions  robby meets a waitress named julia  played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore  whose reputation is anything but this character  julia too is engaged  and when robby finds himself without a wife  his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding  seeing as how her fiance  the  miami vice  loving glenn  matthew glave   doesnt seem all that interested  as the time goes by  we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding  hes merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup  something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women  its obvious that robby is going to fall for julia and feel a strong need to rescue her  but what is a lighthearted romantic comedy for  this isnt sleepless in seattle  but id actually compare it to that before id compare it to happy gilmore  while the wedding singer maintains some of that postsnl cornball humor  its sincerity and charm carry it a very  very long way  sandler is great in his role  and yes  if you allow it  you can take him seriously  barrymore seems perfect along side him  and although the two more likely represent genx moronism and partygirl ditzism  respectively   the two go together like bread and butter as a mideighties couple  one scene in particular  where julia ponders the future in a mirror  is so well done  i was on the verge of tears  unfortunately  sandler is going to make a lot of people shrug this one off as a nobrainer  but its got so much surprise substance packed inside that im encouraging everyone to go see it  in fact  the entire theater applauded when the film ended  and laughs were so consistent  some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar  the 1985 setting was milked for everything it was worth  and for those of us that are old enough to remember it  it was a bodacious trip back  and done very well   sandler shows a new side to himself while maintaining all his original charm  or is it anticharm    while the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit  grading it on pure enjoyability would give this one four stars  its hilarious  and its touching  its got that great cheezy humor  but it also takes sandler to a higher level than anyone expected  this is one to see again and again  is it possible the wedding singer could be one of the sweetest romantic comedies of 1998  my  magic 8ball  predicts it is certain  
0	paul verhoeven  the dutch auteur who dragged his violent  sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film  has never been what id consider a thoughtful director  though some of his films  notably starship troopers  have been lauded as artistic achievements   but he is the kind of hollywood film maker whos managed to  no matter what the budget  make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils  starship troopers was essentially a bmonster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange  a great film thats nearly impossible to find on video  yet showgirls is everywhere   in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins  the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards  who may actually be 45 silicone   in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage  its not a completely successful film  but as a failure its certainly an interesting  and mostly entertaining  one  my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores  spetters  a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the subculture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange  havent yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight   i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop  a bleak superhero satire with a robotic hero thats as touching as schwarzeneggers in t2  that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics  its violence seemed to be there for a purpose  namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread  not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience  theres a jawdropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him  he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victims every fearful tic  its a startling moment of barbaric  maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punknoir  in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just wont shut up  he impales a coworker  drowns another and so on  but why  his character is introduced as a smug genius  the kind whos always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear  sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place  though once the character becomes invisible  this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster  the kind who just wont die  hollow mans protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda  elizabeth shue  acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm  and her lover  a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin whos saddled with the films worst lines   ive lost cohesion again     theyre a typical aaron spelling couple  goodlooking but as vacant as george w  bushs republican national convention speech  i  e  bush referring to clinton      so much promise    but to what end  to what end    this actually got applause  suddenly warren beatty doesnt look so absurd   the rest of the films characters are all well past thirty  though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained oneliners  is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywoods new character developing technique  ahh  what a cynical time we live in    as the picture opens we meet cain  kevin bacon   an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret  so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentations  project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility  for what purpose is never hinted at   theyve performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine  in a twist worthy of the films 1950s late show origins  to impulsively experiment on himself  caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his coworkers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead  our mad scientist is turned invisible  after several fxheavy complications   then he inexplicably  its hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures  but this is never explored  and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human   begins raping  assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases  always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger  it grows abundantly clear with each new release that its verhoevens films that have become hollow  like the rest  this one is cold  heartless  and full of contempt for humanity  but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit  insight and makes no statement other than  audiences will pay for anything these days   its an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level  or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun  thrillaminute ride  verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care  the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick  how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self  a couple weeks ago  after seeing the trailer  a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability  hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa  in a serious manner to boot  but oh yeah  it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway  verhoeven delivers the sleazy  goods   but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner  here it just feels icky and uncomfortable  the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses  caressing their breasts with his lens all while fauxpsycho music strains in the background  its plainly obvious that verhoeven isnt exploring voyeurism  like in the classic peeping tom  but exploiting it and not even doing that very well  its funny that with all the technology 90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a womans naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand  most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks  in fact its largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since  by the end  most of his potential victims don inferred glasses that track his body heat  as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov  a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre   and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked  the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy  it happens when a lab assistant  kim dickens  who looks like she stepped out of playboy  in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon  suddenly pauses    are you looking at me    she queries  obviously haunted  its a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982  the apex of the mad slasher craze   those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer  and theyre the only reason to check out hollow man  preferably as a midweek bargain rental  youve been warned  but you probably wont listen  will you  tis a pity    
1	in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer  professor with such livedin naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance  ever since wall street  douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid80s  in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen  with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world  youd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a goodnatured veneer  but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton  douglas played the role straight and out in the open  in wonder boys his performance isnt showy or a tour de force  its simple yet truthful  he embodies grady  a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes  grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map  when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop  we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms  grady points out  in his narration  that they only do so out of jealousy  their target is the very writerly named james leer  played by the always understated tobey maguire   a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for  leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions  he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges  hes portentous and gloomy  as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers  though his act is a little too calculated  he reminds me of the selfimposed outcast film director  jim jarmusch  dead man  ghost dog   whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner  the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer   exclusively dressed in black  and with his spiked hair dyed snow white  leer is similar  a guy who equates quirks with depth  tobey maguire fits well in the role  with his round  sweeteerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude  but unlike cort  maguire is easier to warm up to  hes a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility  katie holmes plays hannah  a beautiful  talented writing student just itching to get in gradys pants  this is a plot line i had trouble with  douglas  in his old age  is beginning to resemble jerry springer  a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions  at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady  maybe its because im jealous  and wish holmes was throwing herself at me  after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth   then i think of douglass real life companion  the breathtaking catherine zeta jones  seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping  suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand  that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie  and im pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas  there is a movie in there somewhere  grady  rather chivalrously if you ask me  resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell  a droll frances mcdormand   who is his age  but also married to another professor  okay  maybe not so chivalrous  there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says   she was a junkie for the printed word  lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice   robert downy j  r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm  downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual  hes arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance  the actor is perfectly cast here  and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor  i wish wonder boys had more of him  searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless  for it meanders through its running time  but thats part of its charm  and maybe im a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia  a place im greatly fond of  and a place rarely explored in american cinema  everyone has a subgenre  be it war films  westerns  dance movies  that they happen to be privy to  im privy to films about literary types i  e  those individuals enthralled by the written word  and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch  the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters  rather than generic mapped out story points  sometimes the dialogue is too clever  but thats a problem i wish i found with films more often  another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted  like its characters  but as the story progresses it begins to open up  for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types  and as a lowkey comedy for its chuckleworthy throwaway gags  the gags are like those in the great robert altman  m  a  s  h  the long goodbye  movies  where jokes exist as asides on the fringes  like jokes in life often do  the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog  and incessant smoking of marijuana isnt ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things  curtis hanson  who before his last film  la confidential  toiled about with exploitation fare like losin it  an early tom cruise sex comedy  and the hand the rocks the cradle  has graduated to more meaningful films  he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style  the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up  the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party  but in a wonder boys party  it fits  the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen  its the cinematic equivalent to a good read  novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies  many will find it slight  but i found much to savor among its subtleties  
1	with his last two films  shine and snow falling on cedars  australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there  and his latest  hearts in atlantis  is no different  its structure  beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle  is similar to the green mile  which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books  the parallels dont end there  either  atlantis was adapted by william goldman  who had previously penned the bigscreen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for kings dreamcatcher  even the films content is a bit reminiscent of mile  in fact  its the perfect blend of the feelgood 60s nostalgia of stand by me  also by king  and mystical power hokum of mile  kings atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories  but the main focus here is on the first  and longest  tale  called low men in yellow coats  the films title comes from the second chapter   its set in 1960 harwich  connecticut  where 11yearold bobby garfield  anton yelchin  lives in a boarding house run by his cold  selfcentered mother elizabeth  hope davis  joe goulds secret   who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son  bobby spends his time with his two closest friends  john sullivan  will rothhaar  and tomboy carol gerber  mika boorem   who become something like the kevin  paul and winnie of harwich  when a new tenant moves into the vacant room  the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan  anthony hopkins  hannibal   a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobbys mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror  ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature  after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday   dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men  a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers  i wont go into what these powers are  but theyre considerably toned down from the book  and dont involve black stuff flying out of teds mouth  a la mile   atlantis presentday setting which bookends the film is based on the novels final chapter  titled heavenly shades of night are falling  and features david morse  in yet another connection to the green mile  as a married  middleaged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years  atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks cedars  which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski  the oscarnominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowskis red  the acting is solid from everyone  including hopkins  who never once makes you think of dr  lecter  most impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem  who both had tiny parts in along came a spider  while i didnt really have much of a problem with goldmans screenplay  i do need to point out at least one inconsistency  goldman  for those of you who dont read premiere  writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody elses films  carefully explaining why they all suck  make no sense and insult their audiences  while somehow failing to mention the crap that hes penned  like the generals daughter   its meanspirited but fun to read  mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business  including michael jackson  o  j  and robert blake   in atlantis  which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby  one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back  well  hes not  and it doesnt make sense  1  41  pg13 for violence and thematic elements 
1	a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hiphop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why todays youth seem attracted to black culture  the review if black  white  the new film from writerdirector james toback  is eventually remembered for only one thing  it will be the revelation that brooke shields  claudia schiffer  marla maples and mike tyson can act  however  this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that  black  white is a fascinating film  it makes a statement about americas youth and hiphop culture without getting heavyhanded overly serious  featuring a cast of known commodities  ben stiller  robert downey jr   and hot newcomers  singers bijou phillips   tobacks is a complex film worth seeing  black  white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other  a la robert altman  there is dean the basketball player  allan houston  who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear  stiller  in exchange for fifty grand a game  this eventually spills over into the life of deans longtime friend rich  power   a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem  rich has to deal with the imminent opening of a whiteowned club on his turf  meanwhile  the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager  shields  and her gay husband terry  downey jr    others who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will  joe pantoliano as his district attorney father  jared leto as a high school teacher  marla maples as the mother of one of hiphop crazed teens  claudia schiffer as deans girlfriend  and mike tyson as    mike tyson  the stories ebb and flow through the film  losing and gaining prominence over time  friendships are lost  lovers are gained  and there is an occasional burst of violence  originally rated nc17 in the united states  black  white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls  while the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating  viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing  the threeway sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for  and several audience members got up and left at that point  the frequent sex is one of the films few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film  to tobacks credit  the level of violence in black  white is almost nil  these gangstas and hiphop artists are given real problems and concerns  and only become guntoting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way  whenever a character finds himself on donagers handheld digital camera  he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence  but not everyone has fully bought into the idea  charlie  phillips  is full of bluster about why she loves hiphop  but admits that  in ten years time  ill be way over this   these youth know they are going through a phase  and are simply enjoying it  toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny  most of the humour comes from mike tyson  who provides the films comic relief without really trying  he is given big words like vernacular to say  and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson  he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better  playing on tysons image as a dimwit  but tyson also gets the films scariest moment  as he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry  tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm  the scene is entirely improvised  with downey jr  being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction  the reaction he gets  being slapped and then choked is astonishing  as downey jrs face turns a frightening shade of purple  black  white is a film about hiphop culture  and the films omnipresent hiphop soundtrack strongly supports this  but toback keeps things from becoming too serious  by moving from story to story as quickly as he does  toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one characters struggle  thus black  whites message about hiphop becomes secondary to the film itself  toback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hiphop along the way  and we do

0	look  the new version of  psycho  came out and the world didnt end  i guess gus van sant really isnt the bringer of the apocalypse  unfortunately  though  that  psycho  didnt end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it  van sants controversial  retelling  of alfred hitchcocks classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere  even before it premiered   without benefit of an actual viewing  many have said that the film will  at best  suck  being an  almost  good critic  i waited until i actually saw it to decide that the film  at best  sucked  and that concludes the use of the word  suck  and  hopefully  the thoughts that i am a braindead orangutan   director gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it  shotforshot  using the same  exact script  with a few minor alterations   the inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary  even though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time  suspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original  sadly  that did not occur  it is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin  from the original  psycho   but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen  in moores case  the film would have been helped if  the x files  gillian anderson had been cast instead  especially since moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression  from the cold demeanor and expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence  moore is scully  mortensen  who i liked in  g  i  jane   opts to play sam loomis as a cowboyhick  which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point  sam has a twang and a cowboy hat  but thats about it  mortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory  anne heche  in the janet leigh role  does a few good things in her brief time on screen  at least her marion crane has a little life in her  which cant be said for most of the rest of the cast  the best work  though  comes from vince vaughn  as the demented mamas boy  norman bates  hes not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins  but he is effective both in being naughty and nice  the best part of the film is the dinner scene heche and vaughn  where they simply talk  there is some solid acting there  something that is not carried through the rest of the film  van sant has made a boring film  all the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 arent as eyecatching now  what passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they dont impress or excite  van sant  in what i assume is a grasp at originality  decided to put some streamofconsciousness images into a few famous scenes  was that a lamb in the middle of the road   these images  included with some questionable editing choices  took away from the scenes themselves and caused  at first  bewilderment and  later  laughter  definitely not hitchcocks intention  at least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmanns original famous and terrific score  if a film like  psycho  does not frighten  then whats the point  aside from norman  the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience  there are things van sant and company could have done to at least make their recreation interesting  in the end  however  the new  psycho  is a noble attempt  but  alas  a dismal failure  
1	after the average mouse hunt  the silly small soldiers and the entertaining antz  dreamworks try again with the childrens film market with this stunning adaptation of the moses story  as the film warns us at the beginning  its not the full story  and some liberties have been taken  but generally this the bible story we all know and love  featuring burning bushes  the plagues and the parting of the red sea  the only thing missing is charlton heston  instead  we get val kilmer voicing moses  an hebrew who is placed in a river by his mother and rescued by the queen of egypt  helen mirren   we flash forward several years to see moses and brother rameses  fiennes  all grown up  moses soon finds out from brother and sister miriam and aaron  sandra bullock and jeff goldblum  that he isnt really the son of the pharaoh seti  patrick stewart  and that it his destiny to free the hebrews from the egyptians tyrannical rule  he soon sets about this  along with his wife tzipporah  michelle pfeiffer   rameses and his two wizard friends  voiced by steve martin and martin short  try to stop moses completing his task  while the plot is familiar and somewhat exciting for adults  for children reared on aladdin and hercules  this film could be the most godawful thing theyve ever seen  gone is the quick fire humour and standard  easy to follow plot  but  spectacularly  and to dreamworks credit  nearly every child in the audience was captivated by the story and events happening on screen  jeffrey katzenberg  who produced this film  certainly knows how to keep a child interested  hes included some songs in the film  plus some comedy  and a exciting chariot chase  to keep the children interested  and somehow  himself and the directors still manage to get all the drama and intensity of the story across  without ever being boring  its a remarkable achievement  also remarkable is the animation  which puts hercules  an almost slap dash effort  to shame  relying on hand drawn and computer animation  the backgrounds and characters are amazingly detailed  the film seems a little caught up with its amazing visuals by showing a lot of sweeping visuals and moving shots  but they do look incredible  the final plague where god kills every first born child  and the parting of the red sea have to be seen to be believed  kudos to the animators  the vocal talent is also very good  val kilmer does a fine job as moses  although he doesnt sing  and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses  and he does sing   sandra bullock and jeff goldblum are great  and steve martin and martin short are very good  but not in the film long enough  finally  michelle pfeiffer does excellent work as moses wife  kudos also goes to the voice of god  who instead of booming and bombastic is quiet and subdued  sadly  he is uncredited  and i couldnt quite work out who the voice was    but email if you do   the songs are good  ranging from the usual love sonnets to the traditional big production number  they dont disturb the movie  and while not particularly memorable  they are nice to listen to  theyre well sung aswell   the musical score is suitably epic  with some beautiful tunes  coupled with the superb visuals  the prince of egypt is a visual and aural treat  backed up with a great story  entertaining both for kids and adults  this film is a must see  a david wilcock review  1998   you know  for kids   norville barnes 
0	and now the highflying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics  and it isnt pretty  this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer  a version of dumass the three musketeers  by bringing in popular asian actorstunt coordinator xing xing xiong  whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez  our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting  the end result is a tepid and dull actionadventure ripoff that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu  the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay  dartagnan  justin chambers  is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer  he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents  in paris  he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu  stephen rea   who is trying to overthrow the king  and richelieus maninblack associate febre  tim roth   the killer of his folks  he finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk  so he rounds up aramis  nick moran   athos  jan gregor kremp  and porthos  steven spiers  to free the musketeers wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the kings prison  dartagnan and his new frisky love interestchambermaid francesca  mena suvari  play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen  catherine deneuve  ends up being captured by the menancing febre  forcing the musketeers to regroup  with dartagnan leading the charge  and save the day  director peter hyams  end of days  obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles  but here its a disaster  one problem is that  in reality  most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones  jet lis high risk is a ripoff of die hard  not the other way around  ironically  there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all  maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes  most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20 to 30minute action sequences  because they know the scenes have to carry the picture  the musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano  sudden death   horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth  and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers  the wedding planner  to deliver his mousy self as a leader  chambers dartangnan isnt a musketeer  hes a mouseketeer  and hyams use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are wellnoted  but thats the only standout in an overall flat production  
1	is it just me  or have disney films gradually lost their appeal  i was almost stunned by the quality of  who framed roger rabbit    a fun  unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together    the little mermaid  harkened back to  and perhaps surpassed  the classic disney animations from the first half of the century  however  the endless stream of  the little mermaid  wannabes is getting to me  you know the spiel  a lame plot recycled from some wellknown story  colorful  almost psychedelic animation  the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson  the comedic sidekicksidekicks  the seemingly unattainable love interest  a few catchy songs  a few injokes for adults  and the occasional out of place warnerbrotherscoyotefalloffthecliff type joke  its a formula  and like any formula  it gets tiresome  thats why im delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli  a japanese cartoon studio  from what ive seen of their movies   kikis delivery service  and the already englishdubbed and american distributed  my neighbor totoro    foreign audiences are in for a treat  these movies  particularly  kikis delivery service   are wonderfully original and entertaining    kikis delivery service  starts with an unusual premise  kiki  upon hearing forecasts of clear skies  decides it is time for her to leave home  this is unusual because kiki isnt a college student or a young adult making her start on the world  but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch  her mother is also a witch  and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training  her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance  just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences  but no mention is made of the occult  and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie  kikis mother acts as a village doctor  and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom  kiki must choose a city to move to  and what she chooses is the costar of the movie  a german seaport town  far removed from the country life she has been used to  initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding  shes discouraged  and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch  on the verge of leaving for a new town  she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it  the favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier  a onepersons delivery service  this is where the movie becomes shockingly good  kikis job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her  the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesnt seem forced or artificial  but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light  theyre three dimensional  impossible to quickly evaluate  possessing of faults  and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl  however  each one has something about them  some interest or trait  that makes them interesting and unique  the personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings  the seaport town genuinely looks impressive  capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the 1950s  this beauty is beauty with depth  for every detail left in  dozens are only hinted at  i could probably go on all day  but i wont  suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie  some of my favorites are kikis relationship with the bakers husband  although hes quiet  never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie  and he initially scares her  his kindness wins her friendship  in the garage of a deliverees house can be found a vintage model t  two old ladies have a relationship evolving from masterservant to friendfriend  such details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg  added on top of this is a lesson on the importance of selfworth  kiki initially seems to derive much of her selfworth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her  but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment  making her question the importance of such beauty  this causes kiki to lose faith in herself  however  kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings  but the innate beauty inside her  seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous  and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i dont even want to hint at it  the ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and  ironically  the most disneyesque moment ive ever seen  if you dont hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention  the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions  there is no violence  however cartoonish  no songanddance number  and kikis pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick  although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes  however  i would be surprised if disney doesnt give jiji more jokes  or at least the voice of some comedian  refreshingly enough  the moral lesson of the movie is not selfcontradicted  a habit disney movies have gotten into    beauty and the beast  s beautiful belle  for instance  learned that beauty was derived from a persons inside  and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing  kiki  on the other hand  learns to separate her wardrobe from her selfimage  and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film  another difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for  kikis delivery service   not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be  but with a greater attention to realism and detail  it fits the movie to a t  this is particularly true with scenes of kikis flights  the extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold  and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film ive ever seen  im not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states  disney tentatively plans a theater release of  monoko hime  shortly following the summer 97 japanese release  and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that  id guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release  although the wait is unfortunate  its good to know that its being released at all  for  kikis delivery service  is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release  watch this movie  along with  man bites dog   and perhaps something by woody allen  this is the best movie ive ever seen

1	mpaa  not rated  though i feel it would likely be pg  for martialarts violence   with three movies already  re  released theatrically in america  and at least three more on their way  jackie chan is one of the newest  hot properties  in action adventure stardom  and its just about time  for over twentyfive years  jackies been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong  thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy    drunken master  has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to  make it big  this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong  im not entirely sure why  exactly  in many ways   drunken master  is similar to most of jackies other early films  such as  fearless hyena  i and ii   master with cracked fingers    half a loaf of kung fu    spiritual kung fu   and others  in fact  looking at all these early films together  one gets the impression that they were stamped out  cookiecutter style  at a rate of four to six per year  all using the same casts and telling very similar stories  to be honest  i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste  theyre quite different from action movies as we know them in america  these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past  with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together    drunken master   though its plot is tighter than some  is no exception    as an aside   drunken master  was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw  and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen    in a movie theater in seattle  as part of an asian film festival  at the time  i didnt really think it was anything special    but after having seen more films like it  its kind of grown on me     drunken master  s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies  such as  fearless hyena  i and ii and  master with cracked fingers  slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harshseeming master  and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end  a formula that has been  adapted   to put it kindly  by american films such as karate kid   more specifically  jackie chan plays the part of wong feihong  aka  naughty panther   a funloving  practicaljoking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good  but not quite good enough  after embarrassing his instructors assistant by beating him roundly  then beating up a bully in a marketplace  wong feihong tries to hit on a pretty girl  but discovers that she  and her mother  can hit back  better than he can    and is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt  respectively  his father  wong keiying  is unhappy about this  and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages  keiying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment  which feihong does not like at all  while escaping from this punishment  feihong meets up with a drunken old man  who proceeds to thrash him soundly  then take him on as a student and thrash him some more  this turns out to be su huachi  a legendary master of drunkenstyle kung fu  he assigns feihong a series of bizarre tasks  such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame  cracking walnuts with his hands  and other such exercises  that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up  then  when hes ready  he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu  unfortunately  the lazy feihong only practices six of them      drunken master  features some wonderful martial arts sequences  with jackie winning some fights and losing others  its been said before  but ill say it againthese fights dont just happen  theyre as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance  and it shows  in his fights  jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment benches  jugs  cups  bowls  fruits and vegetablesoften in new and surprising ways  the fight scenes  particularly those toward the end of the film  are unparallelled in most american films  whether jackie wins or loses  its really something to see    and its often as funny as anything  too  and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very  very good at  theres very little thats new in this moviejackie winning fights  jackie getting beaten badly by a master  jackie going through punishment or training    these schticks have all been seen before  in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties  but theyre still hilarious as ever  likewise  jackie has a great supporting cast  many of whom were also in other early jackie films  and theyre often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own  the really big thing about  drunken master   though  that inspired several copycats  including a couple starring jackie himself  and a sequel fifteen years later  was the drunkenstyle kung fu  im not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu  but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security    and it apparently helps if youre drunk while youre doing it  genuine or not  i have to admit  theres just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize whats going on  come to think of it  perhaps this element is what accounts for this films success over any of the other jackie films    its not just martial arts  its the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go   whoa     on the negative side  the cinematography in this film is nothing special  the film stock is rather primitive  the plot is often rather slow  and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background    gone with the wind   this isnt  still  if you like martial arts films  or like what youve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more  give it a shot  its much more  real  than chuck norris or jeanclaude van damme  you might very well like it  another interesting thing about  drunken master  has to do with its video availability in the us    drunken master  is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original  letterboxed  hong kong subtitled form  commercially available on vhs  from magnum video  in a gold box  for about 10   there are plenty of other early jackie films around  but these are typically either in dubbed  panandscanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase  thankfully   drunken master   at least  is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen  at a very affordable price  if you like  drunken master   take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there  even the dubbed ones arent really too bad    if nothing else  you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue   i particularly recommend  spiritual kung fu    half a loaf of kung fu   the  fearless hyena  movies  and  snake  crane arts of shaolin   also  the mostlyunrelatedstorywise sequel   drunken master ii   will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year  though what its americanrelease title will be is still uncertain  and comes highly recommended by this reviewer  also  for a rather different interpretation of the character wong feihong  who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore   ive been told to suggest the  once upon a time in china  series starring jet li  though i havent personally seen any of them yet   if you choose to watch  drunken master   i really hope you enjoy it  and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema

1	harmless  silly and fun comedy about dimwitted wrestling fans gordie and sean  david arquette and scott caan  who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king  oliver platt   when king is screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter  joe pantoliano   gordie and sean take it upon themselves to find their fallen hero and restore his glory  my biggest fear about ready to rumble was dispatched early on  as the filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed  but not fake  mind you   the hook of the movie is that gordie and sean are just too stupid to realize that  arquette and caan are suitably over the top with their performances  which is exactly what a movie like this requires  and oliver platt  one of my favorite actors  is a riot as the drunken washedup exchampion  many have scoffed at the idea that platt should be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler with an unbeaten record  but for me it just added to the  silly factor  of the film  thereby increasing my enjoyment of it  one casting complaint however  rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer  please    if rose mcgowan is sexy then im marilyn manson  given the current state of the actual wcw  if oliver platt were appearing as jimmy king right now on wcw programming  hed be the most popular guy they have  on a similar note  the  plot line  of the wresting portions of the film are more entertaining than anything the wcw writers have been able to come up with in the last two years  although one does have to ask    why would any wrestling promoter fire the head wrestler of a company who is both unbeaten and extremely popular with the fans  director brian robbins  youll remember him as eric from tvs  head of the class   just knows how to make good dumb movies  this movie fits in nicely with his previous efforts good burger and varsity blues  and screenwriter steven brill  the epic mighty ducks trilogy  late last night  manages to keep things both sophomoric and clever at the same time  with almost all the jokes of the film getting a laugh out of me  the only exceptions to that were  1  a scene involving a van full of singing nuns and 2  any scene involving the old woman wrestling fan  those moments made me cringe andor groan  as an added bonus though  the audience is treated to outtakes from the film as the final credits roll  pg13

0	  theres nothing new under the sun  is a phrase often used when the speaker actually means  lets find something to copy   of course there are very few completely original ideas  even earthshattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience  there is  after all  no need to reinvent the wheel time after time  recently it seems that hollywood doesnt feel the need to even rewrite the script  my understanding of the word  sequel  is a continuation of the story  the film industry has defined the word to mean reshooting the original with minor changes  have an overwhelming desire to see an inferior version of brian depalmas adaptation of the steven king novel  this is your dream come true  rachel  emily bergl   a high school outcast  is beginning to notice weird things happening around her  doors slam shut by themselves  glass globes blow up  her mother has severe mental problems and her father is absent  a popular boy unexpectedly asks her out  the incrowd conspires to embarrass her at a public event  any of this sound familiar  once the audience catches on that this is the same story as  carrie   theres little to do but wait for the inevitable ending  the effects are a bit better this time around  but the film doesnt work nearly as well  there are a couple of minor plot differences  rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized  the boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than in the original  they keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest  and  uh  there must be other story changes but none stand out  one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell  over 20 years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie  now a high school counselor  she befriends rachel  but her characters potential is squandered  theres too much about sue that doesnt make sense  after the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates  sue is driven mad and spends time in the institution that rachels mother is in  still living in the same small town  the woman with a wellknown history of mental problems is hired as a high school counselor  sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is a genetic disease  this may be the one original idea in the film  but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as a  disease  is never explained  sues eventual fate is an admission by director katt shea and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character but couldnt figure out what to do with her  blink and youll miss it  some of the events are filmed in black and white  but the rationale for this is unknown  it doesnt add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random    the rage  retains some of the trappings of  carrie  without the meaning  in the first film the color red was a motif connected to carries onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating  here theres an abundance of red  but for no apparent purpose  the casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to wear thin  one might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds  the biggest mistake the film makes is including clips of the original  seeing sissy spacek on the screen only points to the quality of that film  and the flaws in this one

0	upon first viewing of this movie  the phrases  been there  and  done that  come quickly to mind  spy hard manages to steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films  the most popular of which are airplane and the naked gun series  stealing stuff can be profitable in this industry  but only when you steal the right stuff  what little plot there is involves dick steele  aka  agent wd40  leslie nielsen  trying to save the world from an almost deranged madman played by andy griffith  along the way to it goal  goal    the film manages to spoof mainly the james bond type films  but also manages to hit on films such as home alone and sister act  the trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny  or at the least  satirical  spy hard achieves neither  as it borrows all of the wrong elements from the superior zucker brothers films  the  dick  the world is in danger  what is it  well  its a big roundish ball floating in space around the sun     im paraphrasing   type of exchange is used at least four times in the opening ten minutes of the film  each time getting progressively less funny  what they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brothers films while writing their own dialogue  director rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors  especially nielsen  who can do this quite well  than on the delivery and context of their lines  much of the time cutting the punchline short  the whole film seems to be in a race with itself to be over  as is evident in the final sequence  where there is no comedic denouement after the climax  as was usual in the zucker brothers films and in spy hard  the end credits tend to replace this by being out of context  one of the more amusing was   captain of the enterprise       james t  kirk   overall  i thought this was a very weak effort  while all of the right films to spoof were chosen  they used none of the right spoofing methods  next time they should  spy  a little bit harder        excellent  one of a kind  must see       entertaining  worth the price of admission      fair  nothing much special     what were they thinking   
0	at first glance  i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise  its plotline goes like this  the evil king cromwell  desiring to take over the world  resurrects an evil  ancient sorceror  xusia for power  he attacks the kingdom of ehdan and kills young prince talons parents  given a triplebladed sword  which can shoot bad guys  like a gun  by his dying father  talon vows for revenge  eleven years later  when hes established his own army  the mercaneries  he vows to take back his kingdom  along the way  he meets up with alana  whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell  talon vows to help  and  after a series of minor escapades  eventually ends up rescuing alanas brother  and several other prisoners   only to be captured himself  in other words  put on a cross to be crucified    fortunately he frees himself  rescues alana from marrying cromwell  defeats xusia  and then cromwell  all with his triple bladed sword  during the final battle  the blade breaks  but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade   then  everything ends happily  unfortunately  the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds  what would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping  bad acting  and gruesomely gory  bloody scenes  never once does the story seem to connect together  it just jumps around repeatedly  this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia  after telling him that he needs his help  he leads the warlock out into daylight  but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards  wait a minute  didnt the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade ehdan  which he cannot do by military force  if that is the case  why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him  and why does he manage to take over ehdan anyway  these questions are just never  no  never  answered in the film  another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life  another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alanas wedding to cromwell     and finally at the end  instead of settling down with alana  he just tells her to  wait   and then he just rides off  in addition to the extremely bloody scenes  this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure  even some attempts to make it exciting  a few fire scenes  battle scenes  dont work  it just completely fails altogether miserably  the only good thing about this film is its musical score  contributed by david whittaker  who had an  extremely  short music composing career  the score is boomy and adventurous  powerful  and a billion times better than this film is  my suggestion  steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead  if you can find it   ironically  though  before the films credits roll  there is a message indicating that a sequel  tales of the ancient empire  would follow  to my relief  and delight   it never got into production  because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office  grossing only 39 million  critics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer  all right  leonard maltin rightfully called it  second rate in scripting  and acting  and ataglance film reviews called it  a confusing  stupid  unimaginative  unengaging  bloodfilled bore   i totally agree with these reviews  all right  and i hope that this piece of   will be forgotten about  there are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer  i hope you get a good laugh out of this review  but i am not laughing  in fact  my insults dont even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time  
1	it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst3k  tm  he had never seen any episodes of the show  and i have watched a scant few  due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes  for those of you not familiar with the premise  dr clayton forrester  beaulieu  wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public  to achieve this  he  in the words of the tv series theme  which is missing in the movie   bumped mike nelson  nelson   on the noggin and then shot him into space   and is monitoring nelsons reactions to the movies he is forced to endure  rather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies  nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions  tom servo and crow t  robot  the format of the show consists of nelson  servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched  and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love  the ship on which our heroes are marooned  only two things are different in the movie  the absence of forresters sidekick  tvs frank  and the slower pace of the jokes  this latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke  for their big screen outing  the producers have chosen  this island earth   a 1954 classic  and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill  unfortunately for that film  but making it ideal mst3k fodder   acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which  by todays standards  are less than impressive  nelson  co  make jokes about everything from japans dominance in the world market  to star trek  to the state of disrepair of seattles kingdome  and most of them work  unfortunately  the segments set outside the satellites movie theater seem out of place and arent particularly funny  but at least theyre fairly short  the big question about this movie though is  why  i presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series  rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago   but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen  there are no special effects to dazzle you  no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat  and no use of digital surround sound  so  it seems pointless to spend 8 per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for 3  and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts  nevertheless  mst3k  tm provides more laughoutloud opportunities than any film youre going to see this year  and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse  given its uniqueness  i hesitate to grade it against other films  but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of  unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad bmovies  it does well  
1	the rocky horror picture show special edition  1975  starring  tim curry and susan sarandon cult films are never mainstream  the casual viewer of a cult film will look at it and be repulsed and confused  yelling out what the hell is that    fans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the hidden jokes they missed the first time around while normal movie watchers will look at them like theyre insane  the rocky horror picture show  recently rereleased in a special edition to video  is the mother of all cult films  period  like some other cult films  most notably little shop of horrors  the rocky horror picture show is a musical with a twisted edge to it  this movie begins out innocently enough a couple get engaged at a friends wedding and get a flat tire in the middle of the night while its raining  they go to a castle to try to use the phone  little do they know that the castle is owned by dr  frank n  furter  a mad transexual transvestite scientist who has recently created a creature he will use for personal reasons  the acting is pretty good overall  tim curry  home alone 2  legend  is overthetop as frank n  furter  its interesting to see that this movie was one of future oscar winner susan sarandons  dead man walking  first film she plays janet  the girlfriend of brad majors  even the singer meatloaf is in it   the songs are all very good yet twisted in their own way  a sampling of titles range from damn it  janet to toucha toucha toucha touch me  all the actors sing their songs with no dubbing from other actors kind of a bad thing  barry bostwick  brad majors  tries to sing as does susan sarandon  but tim curry is clearly the most professional having extensive stage experience  meatloaf sings like meatloaf  the new special edition contains two original movie trailers of the film as well as two songs deleted from the original version  sadly  the songs are tacked after the credits kind of defeats the purpose  if you want to see a different film  watch this one   
0	unfortunately it doesnt get much more formulaic than one tough cop  theres the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain  the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys  the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film  bo dietl  pronounced deedle  baldwin  is one tough cop  a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia  on top of that problem  he has a drunk  gambling addicted partner  penn  who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets  i guess cops arent immune    then  throw into the mix the femme fatale  gershon   right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama  but right in the middle of the film  they throw in a completely unrelated plot point  dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from  the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death  once the case is solved  the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue  whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably  aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso  an insult if you ask me  the performances were pretty good  baldwin  though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec  does a fine job as one tough cop  penn  who also slips into an impression of his brother sean  is even better as a loser tough guy cop  what one tough cop lacks is originality  this film offers nothing new  nothing that you cant get from any cop film  it screams sidney lumet all over the place  perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman  producers of lumets dog day afternoon and serpico  but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film  too much else is lacking  i also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture  something that i almost never notice  but once i saw that  i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot  at times  i was hoping to see it  one tough cop isnt laughable  nor is it a terrible film  but it just isnt unique  it is a classic example of a film that didnt need to be made  but one thing is for sure  it could really use a better title  
1	if theres one thing in common about all of hollywoods major studios  its that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more  although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures  fox searchlight and fine line respectively   its obvious theres no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater  so when a movie like gary ross pleasantville comes along  wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production  its a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes  although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted  pleasantville should not be mistaken for a nothought movie  quite the opposite is true  in fact  as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen  the story  both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation  captures the essence of statementmaking in the cinema  not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution  and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross work  it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough  kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture  it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who  through quite a bit of luck  find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named  pleasantville   maguire  as the reserved bud parker  is perfect for the pseudoworld  but the rebellious mary sue  witherspoon  is not at all made for the fatherknowsbest times  its not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end  and begins to teach the townspeople  in a quite unlikely way  what life is  really  like  soon hues of color creep into the black and white world  and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism  others fear the strangeness  at one end is a soda shop ownerturnedpainter named mr  johnson  jeff daniels  and at the other end is a closeminded mayor  j  t  walsh  and his chamber of commerce  but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town  fine performances are turned in all around  maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads  but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j  t  walsh  in his latest and final posthumous performance   daniels brings an atmosphere of awe  inspiration  and hope to his character  whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness  almost to the point where you can sense gene hackmans envy  for daniels  its his most commendable performance of the last three years  or more  and for walsh  its a complementary exclamation point on a fine career  also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen  and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish  theres not much to dislike about pleasantville  and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who dont  
0	when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain  you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie  however  since this film also featured michael madsen  more than capable character actor  this time in the role of protagonist  the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt  however  the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials  madsen plays richard montana  tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio  played by lynch   however  the raid was only partially successful  and montana is getting the rap  so  he begins his own private war against gio  trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt  in the process  he meets gios mistress gina zamora  played by rosie vela  and starts relationship with her too  although it doesnt stink like many of the similar films can  inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine  nobody in this film actually puts much effort  including madsen or lynch  and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke  the only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela  who  apart from showing her more than impressive looks  shows some of the singing talent too  however  this isnt reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would  in most likelihood  forget the next day

0	dont get me wrong  i tend to appreciate bessons naive  unashamedly romantic worldview  an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood  his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving  thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman  and 1997s the fifth element is a goofy paean to love  luv  thats even more of a hoot on repeated viewings  but his joan of arc is a mess  despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a closecropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself  jovovich  bessons own personal muse through the making of his last two films  though theyve since separated   is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan  as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior  but also a fabulous  supermodellevel babe   and besson remains a servicable action film director  though not an especially facile one  leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english  joans struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring  and besson helps you understand how the french could believe  fervently  that god is on her side  bessons big mistake  i think  is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject  yes  joan had visions  but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blueeyed christ figure on display in bessons hallucinatory dream sequences  the whole conceit turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman  billed as  the conscience   shows up  spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell  babbling like ally mcbeal  thats kind of a shame  since she does quite well up to that point  charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness  that darkly attractive aspect of her character  that shes as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord  is more or less betrayed by the final reels  in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing shes overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady whos about to take a fall  as the story winds down  with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire  besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance  trouble is  hes chosen a lurid  often jokey tone for the balance of the picture  including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes  and its impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is  to a great extent  nothing more than a puton  this glib  prefab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyers the passion of joan of arc  1928   a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joans trial  and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema  compared to that film  the messenger plays as a crime against history   directed by luc besson written by besson and andrew birkin cinematography by thierry arbogast music by eric serra starring milla jovovich franceusa  1999 theatrical aspect ratio  2  35  1  
0	take a look at the following equation     a christmas carolghostbustersscrooged yes  scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment  comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether  scrooged is alternatively sick  gross  funny  and then sickly soppy  bill murray plays frank cross  a t  v executive with a horrible personality  hes evil to secretary  actors  crew  everyone  except the t  vs stations boss  of course  played by the late robert mitchum  however  he is then visited by a very dead exec  who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts  past  present and future  who is called the ghost of yet to come  for some reason  sure enough  they arrive  show cross how much of a s  o  b he is  and he changes his way  however  throughout this simple plot  weve got to suffer outlandish special effects  poor comedy  and an very  very mean performance from bill murray  frank cross isnt funny mean  hes just mean  he also isnt very good at emotional scenes  and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film  with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is  and how he has changed  however  the supporting cast are ok  with good performances from mitchum  allen  who plays his girlfriend  and john glover  who plays crosss partner  the ghost of christmas past isnt that bad either  sadly  though  the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of home alone style violence from the ghost of christmas present  played by carol kane  whoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny  should be fired straight away  and the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait  the guy with the annoying voice in police academy 3  if i remeber correctly      who  thankfully  dosent say much  the script is horrendous  michael odonaghue churns out terrible  bad taste jokes  which i guess is the whole point really  then changes direction completely to emotional scenes  and he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes  which are awful  the special effects look nice  but do nothing for the film  theres some impressive make up effects also  the music is also good  which is scored by danny elfman  but great effects and make up dont make a great film  scrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience  seeing as the first 1 hour 20 minutes of the film are so depressing anyway  and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech  why didnt cross just look out his exec window  and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him  overall  then  youd have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided  perhaps a plague  
1	like the great musical pieces of mozart himself  amadeus is a true work of art  it is one of those few movies of the 80s that will be known for its class  its style  and its intelligence  why is this such a good film  there are almost too many reasons to explain  the story  court composer salieri  f  murray abraham  feels waves of different emotions going through his head as wolfgang amadeus mozart  tom hulce  comes into his life as the young genius composer  salieri feels envy  and jealousy  but at the same time is fascinated with mozarts brilliance and ingenious  we travel through mozarts life as a composer  through his struggles  his triumphs  and ultimately  his demise  the acting  abraham is magnificient as salieri  his acting range enables him to focus on each individual emotion and express it through his speech and body language  this performance earned him a well deserved oscar  tom hulce is interesting as well as mozart  a quirky  annoying bratty kid with an annoying laugh  hes strong  but weak at the same time  and must be aided by his wife  elizabeth berridge   who is good in her role  but lacks dramatic depth  jeffrey jones  in a smaller  more dignified role than such roles in stay tuned and mom and dad save the world  is cast perfectly because of his noble charm  the movie  every element of this movie works  the costumes and makeup are very memorable  as well as its stunning art direction  and unforgettable scores  adapted from mozarts original music   while wolfgang amadeus mozart was a genius at music  milos forman proves with his film that he is a genius of filmmaking  this movie is a classic that will be remembered for years to come  ad2am  i almost lost my nose    and i like it  i like breathing through it   jack nicholson  chinatown 
0	therere so many things to criticize about i dont know where to start  recommendation  turn off your brain  dont be like me  decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much  a comet is about to strike earth  causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event  e  l  e   that wiped out the dinosaurs  what follows is the story of a presidents bid to think for the good of his people  a rising reporter  the love story of two teenagers  one of whom discovered the comet   and a team of astronauts on the ship messiah to save the world  firstly  there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film  nor is there anything outstandingly good about it   but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid  to be honest  i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself  which isnt saying much   mimi leders followup to the peacemaker is equally incompetent  with all the big stars wasted    perhaps im just annoyed that the release of the peacemaker in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller  the assignment   it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision  but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives  however  the film simply fails on that note  the effects are wornout  the substandard screenplay limited the acting  and the director continued her sad run in terms of goodfilmmaking credentials  shes still making good money though  t  a leonis unfortunate character  the news reporter  is the foundation of the story and of the cast  but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored  robert duvalls aging astronaut is lifeless  and morgan freemans president is restricted to  well  a righteous president  which means hes not interesting at all   leonis character is the only appealing one  and is played with reasonable conviction  but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc   but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters  warning  spoilers included  but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway   plot holes  plot holes  plot holes  now  e  l  e  is threatening to exterminate more than 99 of the human race  and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there  wheres the logic  leder could have at least made it plausible with 20  and then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish  and those less selfish ones  the ones that stayed at home  were the victims  the film was almost mocking them  telling them they had died for nothing  i also fail to see how two teenagers  carrying a baby  would be the first to climb up the mountainhill  even with a motorbike for a headstart  its unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle  but that doesnt really matter  building caves was a strategy mentioned in dr  strangelove  which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years  now that is a more practical use for caves  what is the point of living in caves  there is no  unlike dr  strangelove  any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure  how do plants grow  if humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves  theres no reason why they cant do it in the open  the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves  obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago  and you cant be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media  in an important mission like that of the messiah  for that matter any mission  it is impossible that isnt sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres  needless to say tens of kilometres  this is not deep impact  its a frivolous cheap impact  but even with all that  some overacting  and a 3  4 rating  its still watchable  just dont think about it  okay  
1	fritz langs first american film since leaving nazi germany  is an eyeopener about a lynch mob in a small town  joe wilson  spencer tracy  is a regular joe  a hardworking stiff  a decent guy  who is living with his two brothers  tom  walcott  and charlie  albertson   in chicago  he is engaged to katherine grant  sylvia sidney   but cant save up enough money to marry her  she takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher  before she departs  she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother  sews up his ripped trench coat  corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento  and kisses him goodbye  a year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city  that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station  driving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her  he arrives at a nearby town called strand  but the deputy sheriff  buggs  meyers  walter brennan  comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him  he accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl  the sheriff  ellis  finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket  he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money  and he fits the general description of the suspect  locked in jail  he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence  in the local bar  the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping  fueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect  a mob storms the jail  burns it down and dynamites it when they cant get through to the prisoners jail cell  the sheriff called the governor for the national guard  but one of his political advisers countermanded that request  saying it wouldnt look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him  somehow joe escapes  but his dog rainbow dies  katherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell  and becomes convinced that he died  the next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses  joe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers  who are startled to see him alive  that he wants revenge  he thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the 22 leaders in the lynch mob  an ambitious district attorney  walter abel  prosecutes the 22 for murder  katherine  not knowing hes alive  remains in a state of shock  but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death  the defense claims that it cant be a charge of murder without a corpse  the trial proves to be interesting  as the citizens in this closeknit  respectable community  lie under oath  providing alibis for each other to prove they couldnt have been at the jail  the sheriff also lies  saying he cant identify anyone in the mob  but proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film  as for proof of the corpse  an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe  in the note  memento is misspelled  which makes katherine realize that joe is alive  when the sentence is announced  20 of the accused are found guilty of murder  but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened  katherine forgives him  and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have  but dont blame lang for all the changes in the film  of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive  mgm couldnt bear to have it made the way lang wanted it  that is  by having tracy die in the lynching  instead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur  and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script  to langs credit  even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference  it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook  his portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised  you couldnt help get the feeling that the citizens didnt care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man  but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their 22 vigilantes from going to jail  even perjuring themselves  their reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they werent going to be convicted  lang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident  he does imply that a dark side to joe wilson has been exposed  and the innocent  jovial goodguy  seen in the beginning of the film  has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience  
0	the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as anywhere but here   there isnt one thing about this motherdaughter relationship melodrama that felt honest  it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives  as for some reason they couldnt figure it out for themselves  if the film looks familiar  that is because  the slums of beverly hills  98   went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances  in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with  alvin sargents script was weak and annoyingly claustral  wayne wangs   the joy luck club   inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldnt convey  pushy mother adele august  susan sarandon  forces her 14yearold daughter ann  natalie portman  to leave a small midwestern burg to go crosscountry with her to beverly hills  the daughter resents her twice divorced  unstable but exotic  schoolteacher mother  bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life  the daqughter doesnt even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and cant stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio  so it becomes a question of who knows best  as the ladies fight it out between them  until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner  adeles dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesnt look that good  as she lands a job in a slum school  has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids  and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive  daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there  during one of many arguments with her freespirited mom  they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed  she runs away  only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop  michael milhoan   who offers her wise counsel  with the cops zen wisdom passed onto the daughter  she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla  during their stay in beverly hills  she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer a t  s  eliot  corbin allred  reader  but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality  as everything seemed staged and unemotional  when she learns her cousin benny  shawn hatosy   who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin  she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasnt clearly shown why she wants to stay there  and for that matter  it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly  the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams  i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say  is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one  able to recognize mothers faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself  mother has a series of setbacks  like being dumped by her dreamboat dentist  bochner  she met on the beach  and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part  but mother learns that her daughter has grownup and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her  she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do  is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do  this of course results in the corny ending  showing that moms heart was always in the right place  only she went about it in the wrong way  this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing  
0	i wish i could accurately describe the theme music for part 3  the best way i can put it is that its funky  i know this is an odd question  but remember the opening music of  police academy 4  citizens on patrol   when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song  citizens on patrol  during the opening credits  its just like that  anyway  part 3 takes place a day after the events of part 2  so technically still 1985   this time  a group of horny teens  who also bring along two aging hippie potheads for some reason  head up to a cabin on crystal lake for a weekend of sex and weed  it turns out that one of the teens had been attacked by jason earlier in her life  which must have been between parts 1 and 2  so why she has returned to crystal lake one day after a new batch of murders is beyond me  shes the lone survivor this time  part 3 was originally shown in theaters in 3d  and from what i can tell from the video  it looks as though they may have been fairly decent effects  jason had long  wild hair when he was unmasked in part 2  now  one day later hes completely bald  also  it being one day later  it cant be friday the 13th now can it  oh well  steve miner is the only director who helmed more than one film in the series  r 
0	a silly film that tries to be a black comedy but plays more like lightweight comedy  with its main asset being a beautiful film location along spains mountainous coastline  howard pigeon  jeff goldblum  is a 40yearold mineral water salesman who is married for 13 years to a wife constantly nagging him  elizabeth  mimi rogers   after a surprise birthday party for him  where his wife bawls him out for coming late to his surprise party  he confides to his best friend that he cant stand it anymore  and then tells him his plan to kill her while vacationing in the same barcelona hotel where they spent their honeymoon  jeff is going through a severe midlife crises  worried that he looks older than his age  he incessantly talks to himself  mostly agonizing over his bitter marriage and chastising himself why he went out with elizabeth for a second time  and then why he married her just because she laughed at his jokes and was attractive  he stutters and acts like a man who has lost his confidence  things change on their vacation  as elizabeth makes an effort to be nice while jeff now becomes the grouch  he nervously rehearses his murder plan in the hotel room  by accident the gun goes off and into the pillow where he imagined elizabeth would be sitting  when other hotel guests and staff come to check about the gunshot  he nervously explains that it was the tv  realizing how unworkable his plan is  he places the gun in the shattered pillow and throws it into the ocean while he waits for elizabeth  but elizabeth found his behavior odd during the entire trip  and when after a great deal of effort to get a reservation at the hotels 5 star restaurant he insists on eating in the room  she decides she had enough of him and checks out without telling him  as a result  he goes to the police to report her missing  while with the police  a telegram comes from his wife saying she left him and is going away because she wants to be alone  his boss and all those he works with are sympathetic to him  and he gets a job promotion  but soon the pillow with the gun is fished out of the water  giving the police cause to arrest him and search his home  there they find letters he has written incriminating him to the murder  the police also find out from the hotel staff about the gunshot heard in his room  in jail  things look bad for him  no one believes him  including his friends and lawyer  his boss fires him and the papers have a field day with the headline story  pigeon  a jailbird  out on bail  he realizes that his only hope is to track down his wife  through a call placed on his credit card  he tracks her down to a mountain resort  once there he learns that she took a hike up the steep mountain and he gets a priest to be his mountain guide after telling him the true story  the film is watchable just for the antics of the jeff goldblum comic performance  he is someone coming apart by the seams  while mimi rogers is his perfect foil  it was mostly pantomine humor  with the comedy charged in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the situation  a very minor farce that might appeal to the sitcom crowd  the film just didnt take its situation seriously and the story had many gaps in it  so it had no chance for black humor to develop  it instead played its setup of the henpecked husband acting out his fantasy strictly for entertainment value to see how many chuckles it could draw  
0	i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year  when matthew perry had just signed on  im big fan of perrys subtle sense of humor  and in addition  i think chris farleys onedge  extreme acting was a riot  so naturally  when the trailer for  almost heroes  hit theaters  i almost jumped up and down  a soda in hand  the lights dimming  i was ready to be blown away by farleys final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perrys big breakthrough  i was ready to be just amazed  for this to be among farleys best  in spite of david spades absence  i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran  sadly  none of this came to pass  the humor is spotty at best  with good moments and laughable oneliners few and far between  perry and farley have no chemistry  the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade  for its his type of humor  and not at all what perry is associated with  and the movie tries to be smart  a subject best left alone when its a farley flick  the movie is a major dissapointment  with only a few scenes worth a first look  let alone a second  perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie  and not surprisingly  the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley  and farleys classic humor is widespread  too  almost heroes almost works  but misses the wagontrain by quite a longshot  guys  lets leave the exploring to lewis and clark  huh  stick to  tommy boy   and well all be  friends   
0	exuniversal soldier luc has to battle a group of newermodel engineered fighters gone bad  the review jeanclaude van damme has a oneliner early on in universal soldier  the return  his latest attempt to remain relevant  that sums up this entire movie  he says  been there  done that   no film critic could possibly sum up van dammes recent film choices any better  while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres  schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films   van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him  martial arts and guns  this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world  with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex  he joins fellow martial artistaction star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away  universal soldier  the return is truly poor  the plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade  specifically terminator 2  judgement day and the similarly named soldier  soldiers kurt russell was an older model supersoldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors  for the good of a planet  schwarzeneggers terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine  the t1000  and jeanclaude  a former universal soldier  has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of  you guessed it  newer model soldiers  considering the poor box office performance of soldier  its amazing that this project was ever given the goahead  luc devereaux  van damme  was the sole remaining universal soldier  or unisol for short   until he was returned to a normal  if muscular  human form  in this sequel  technically the fourth film in the series  following two straighttovideo duds that were ignored here plotwise   luc is now a human trainerconsultant of sorts for the unisol program  working with dylan cotner  xander berkeley  who interestingly also appeared in t2   the unisol program has engineered a tougher  fiercer fighting force with the help of supercomputer seth  unfortunately  upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government  seth takes control of his soldiers  killing everyone in the building except for luc  his partner maggie  his daughter hillary and erin  a reporter trapped inside  the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive  while beating up a group of nearindestructible soldiers  most notably romeo  popular wrestler goldberg   there are lots of fights  gun battles  lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility  there are so many clich  s in this film that it is almost painful to watch  luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on  and in the course of a single night  they go from bickering to falling for each other  to kissing  erin is a patheticallywritten character  people are getting brutally gunned down all around her  and yet  not only does this not seem to frighten her  but she finds time to remind luc that she  isnt leaving without her story   whatever  other laughable moments include a  luc going to a strip club to get internet access  what   and b  a group of rangers  who after having been given good advice  luc tells them that their weapons are useless  and shows them a specific gun which should work better   choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway  guess who wins the battle    not one single scene in universal soldier  the return has any originality to it  when fuelled by don davis loud  driving music score  the films many fights become almost passable  but mostly are full of the same ol jeanclaude moves  director mic rodgers  a former stunt coordinator  keeps the action coming at a rapid pace  with only a few token serious moments to be found  his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows  tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion  if only jeanclaude werent getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li  rodgers could probably have made a decent action film  to place the blame squarely at van dammes feet  however  is an injustice  im not sure that anyone  not even robert deniro or edward norton  could make writers william malone and john fasanos script sound good  one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access  he cringes  looks down and mutters  uh    uhm    they all do  i saw it on 60 minutes  eh he he he  the scripts and indeed the entire films only saving grace is goldberg  he chews up every scene he is in  obviously enjoying his role immensely  he even gives the film a few laughs  as he mutters things like  i really dont like that guy  every time he fails to kill luc  sadly  his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier  the return into anything better than a belowaverage action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straighttovideo  
0	capsule  not as bad a sequel as crow 2 or batman  robin  but still horribly putrid  cheesy and illconceived  this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons    extended review  you know  about halfway through this movie  i realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes  youd have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy  hong kong style martial arts  beautifully choreographed by robin shou  who also plays liu kang  the fight scenes are both mindblowing and graceful  acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep  this is what made the original so fun  but unfortunately for the sequel  we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson  instead  they got john r  leonetti  the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat  not a good choice  while the fight scenes are brutal and eyepopping  the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare  the acting is subpar  which i could endure if it were not for a   the directors style  b   the special effects   c   the treatment of the story and characters  a   mr  leonetti should go back to lighting  in my opinion  i could say dozens of bad things about him  he way overuses slowmotion  he has no eye for action  he cant get even mediocre performances out of actors  and so on  but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping  apparantly  everybody can now fly  hell  im all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot  but not when it happens every few minutes  and is done so poorly  better jumping and acrobatics has been seen in xena  warrior princess  in short  they should have gotten paul anderson back  or at least let robin shou direct    b   unlike the first one  whose sfx were vibrant and somewhat realistic  mk  as special effects are bland  fake looking  and overall just plain bad  i counted at least half a dozen times that bluescreening was painfully obvious  had this movie been made in the 80s  it would have been groundbreaking  but in todays industry  it doesnt even look finished  c   now for the really bad parts  i admit  im an avid fan of the mortal kombat series  the games are amusing diversions  an easy way to work off stress and anger  the first movie was a mindlessly fun thrillride  this could have been a really cool movie  it isnt  the writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audience from teens to preschoolers  some of the plot elements are just plain stupid  how stupid  take  for instance  how our heroes move around  they use giants spheres the roll around underground  supposedly at thousands of miles per hour    oh boy    even worse is the treatment of secondary characters  blink and youll miss em  most characters had more depth in the video games  if you thought batman  robin was bad about this  you aint seen nothin yet  a good 75 of the characters are introduced  kick somebody around a bit  then either die or are forgotten about  theres no explanation at all for this  and for the final blasphemy  the fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly for  the fight hyped to be the most intricate of the movie  lasted about 3 minutes and then just sort of    ended  it almost made me weep  to sum it all up  rent it on video  and fastforward through everything except the fight scenes  
1	its rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year  but that is what disney and pixar animation  s latest film represents  while a bugs life isnt nearly as deep as its predecessor  dreamworks antz  it is just as funny  a bugs life centers  appropriately  around the life of an ant  named flik  flik  cutely voiced by newsradios david foley  hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task  when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost  the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way  the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them  the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper  who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey  when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food  when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission  they never dream he will be successful  they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food  fliks mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return  instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs  who he mistakenly assumes are warriors  when he returns with the warriors  the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes  a bugs life has animation that is simply stunning  the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative  together with the great voice acting  this film is the perfect holiday family film  its main weakness is that it couldnt beat antz to the theaters  making it seem like stale material  
1	note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  be forewarned    all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts   excerpt from as you like it  act ii  scene 7 when william shakespeare penned this passage  he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent  or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash  this is the world of today  and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical highconcept project like the truman show  truman burbank  jim carrey  seems to have the perfect life  he has a pretty  doting wife meryl  laura linney   a comfortable insurance sales position  an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven  a reliable childhood buddy marlon  noah emmerich   except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia  this is paradise  or so it would seem  bizarre  inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in trumans life  a lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky  a rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term isolated follows him around  a radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move  for the first time in his life  it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be  the truman show  directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol  is a remarkably wellconstructed film  paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next  balancing drama with humour  thoughtfulness with abandon  this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy  in many ways  mr  niccols screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca  both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity  with pivotal  characterdefining moments occurring at sea  although the films rather conventional climax doesnt sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first twothirds  and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch  there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception  despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film  it remains foremost a finelycrafted piece of entertainment  constantly light and accessible  the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude  and as the carefullystacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down  the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false  the end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable  crowdpleasing underdog vs  the system formula  while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept  some elements are lacking  the device of mysterious laurensylvia  natascha mcelhone  as a contributing impetus to trumans growing awareness isnt exactly convincing  theres not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves  and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff  ed harris  with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience  thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film  in fact  although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside trumans artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers  it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even  more  deeply in the insulatory seahaven world  with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling  still  the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target  and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright antivoyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city  ive always believed that the versatile ms  linney possesses a tremendous comic gift  she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes  and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character  mischievously flashing a glazed  insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans  cheerfully going over the top  its hilarious to watch her  who would have ever guessed that shed have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film  ms  linney is a delight in the film  but it is mr  carrey who rules the show here  he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank  the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts  but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal  its difficult not to root for truman  in a commanding performance  mr  carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence  and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn  demonstrating admirable restraint  theres an early scene where hes down on his knees gardening  and given his past track record  one almost instinctively anticipates mr  carrey to pull one of more infamous  and in this case  wholly inappropriate sight gags  its almost poetic how this notorious lookatme actor successfully tones it down to play a character whos constantly the centre of attention  in addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast  mr  emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness  the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating trumans antiseptic  white picketfenced smalltown utopia  and by burkhard dallwitzs original score  technical credits are firstrate all around  while the truman show is clearly a definitive highconcept film  its not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one  obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound  ranging from 1965s secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner  all the same  this is a visionary  awardcalibre film  entertaining  provocative  and intelligent  the curious  and possibly disturbing  thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the films concept seems unfathomably outrageous  its abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching  if not actualisation  at least permissiveness of such a scenario  perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr  weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question  perhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world

1	driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small  intimate story  its a quiet film  a slow film  a deliberate film  but if youre patient with it  the movie offers innumerable rewards  such as a pair of selfassured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy  driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhrys pulitzerprize winning play of the same name  which first opened in new york four years ago  the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago  los angeles  london  vienna  norway  and the soviet union  uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy  he also penned the wonderful sleeper  mystic pizza  the film  like the play  is set in atlanta  georgia  and it revolves around two people in their twilight years  a cranky  70something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60something black man who becomes her chauffeur  the movie relies on character  rather than plot  to propel the action  in fact  the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense  it doesnt present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together  rather  driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life  shopping  listening to the radio  visiting the cemetery  eating fried chicken  and so on  the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlantas history  including the 1958 bombing of the temple  the citys oldest jewish congregation  and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr  martin luther king  jr  the story begins in 1948 with daisy  tandy  crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway  the insurance company cancels her insurance  and her son  boolie  decides to hire her a chauffeur  freeman  reprising his role from the play  plays the chauffeur  hoke  the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger  driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature  aging  prejudice  and a great many other things  but more than anything its about a relationship  one that spans 25 years  4 cars  the advent of civil rights  and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon  daisy is strongwilled and set in her ways  and  from the outset  she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur  initially  she treats hoke with contempt  refusing to let him drive her anywhere  once she does get in the car  daisy is the ultimate backseat driver  to make matters worse  she is extremely selfconscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand  eventually  however  daisy is worn down by hokes goodnatured charm and infectious cheer  she softens and opens up to him  tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well  but unfortunately this feisty  cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace  weve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations  from on golden pond to cocoon  nevertheless  tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own  freeman  as hoke  on the other hand  gives the more distinctive of the two performances  there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color  hoke is uneducated and illiterate  but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man  an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior  both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element  in full command of their natural charisma  they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves  they bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movies gentle humor  at the same time  tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama  in his first dramatic role  dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie  tandys loving and patient son  drama seems to agree with aykroyd  taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor  especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently  ghostbusters ii  the great outdoors  my stepmother is an alien   the only other significant characters in the film are daisys housekeeper  idella  marvelously played by esther rolle   good times    and boolies pretentious wife  played by patti lupone  under the direction of bruce beresford  crimes of the heart  tender mercies   driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again  but fortunately  beresford never forgets hes shooting a movie  and accordingly  he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches  such as gorgeous shots of flowers  trees  and tomatoes  in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen  the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety  uhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what

0	okay  bear with me yall  cause first off i have to get this off my chest  what the hell is up with that damn crab    whew  okay  cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end  as cute as the crab maybe  even i know that you need more footage than  that   and that wasnt the only thing getting on my nerves  the cutesy gimmicks  saccharine sweet score  soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar  as amanda  and sean patrick flannery  as tom  might have held some appeal during  oh  say the first 10 minutes of the movie  at first the movie moves along at a quick  interesting pace  it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street  whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just  doesnt  die  a ridiculous concept  yes  but at this point im willing to accept it because im willing to accept that this is how amandas life is changed  how her powers are received  later on  the movie cant seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom  and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying  they werent just repetitive  they were out of place and unnecessary  the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed  sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development  amanda suddenly becoming a great chef  her falling in love with tom  etc    sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good  some places the plot just doesnt make sense  sometimes its way too contrived  the crab bit  for example   and sometimes too corny  peaches emitting dry ice  cant beat that   all in all the plot seemed fragmented  unconnected  not romantic at all  and only funny in some places  so  okay  do the magic powers come from the crab  or the fairy godfather  she can  float  now too  and all of a sudden  instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches  she can put her emotions into her food  tom all of a sudden just accepts amandas  witchcraft  in the end  would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupacs video  what the hell is up with that damn crab  it is unfortunate  because i liked the basic premise of the movie  until it became too fantastical and tiresome  the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least  a  theme for a while  but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables  the humor was good in some places  nolan gets the funniest bits  including that incomprehensible  totally random thing with the dolls   gellar and flannery are qualified actors  and gellar has a particular charm  but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy  or even annette in the upcoming  cruel intentions   than this sorry excuse for a character  its almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is  or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible  the supporting character nolan was a highlight  though he reminded me a bit of kevin in  youve got mail   see footnotes   and  as always  typical of a chick flick  romantic comedy  theres a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background  cued up at all the right places  this sort of got on the nerves after a while  too    simply irresistible  is not hard to understand  light  funny in some places  and generally disappointing because it cant draw the line between romance and protracted sap  between humor and tired slapstick  and how could i refrain from making a pun          simply irresistible  is all too easy to resist    first viewing  2699    did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to  youve got mail   or  the shop around the corner    business rivals fall in love  female counterparts business is in danger of being shut down  female as mother like figure guiding her  the annoying  hysterical exgirlfriends    i really like sarah michelle gellars wardrobe  
0	when i watch a movie like mike nichols what planet are you from  i cant help but feel like everyone is looking at me  its as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness  eyes shooting daggers  quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hardearned money to spend their time watching this    this    thing  i shift uncomfortably in my seat  im reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second or thirdrate celebrities engaging in a teleprompted  funny  conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award  its not my fault  i know its not my fault  but dammit  someones gotta be embarrassed  because it doesnt look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame  im about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movie together  garry shandling  annette bening  john goodman  greg kinnear  mike nichols  do any of these names make you instantly shudder  the answer i would have come up with before today is no  this is quite a list of talented individuals weve got here  granted  john goodman was in the flintstones  and greg kinnear has turned in some lessthanlackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours  but even so  theyve got proven power as excellent supporting players  garry shandling has two television classics under his belt  his ingenious little its garry shandlings show and the larry sanders show  and for gods sake  mike nichols directed the graduate  and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty  so explain this    this    thing  what planet are you from  purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole poppsychology marsvenus phenomenon  but what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringeinducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringeinducing moments  the end result is  unsurprisingly  an unfunny  uninsightful  cringeinducing  thoroughly icky embarrassment  garry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males  they reproduce through cloning  of course   his leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth  find a female of the species  and impregnate her  theyre taught how to pretend that theyre listening by nodding and saying  uhhuh   and how to compliment shoes  imagine my delighted surprise when  oh heavens  all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably  producing comedic results  the lucky winner is fitted with a penis  since theirs  after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence    i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that theyre all just clones    whoops  too late   the penis  when aroused  tends to make a humming noise  the writers  when frequently strapped for ideas  tend to turn to this as a source of  comedy   it isnt funny the first time  it isnt funny the eighth time  it isnt funny the eighteenth time  if anything  it made me feel vaguely selfconscious  garry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear  who turns out to be a generic  unlikable scumbag  hes meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandlings alien character  but hes so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside  kinnears scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks  wow  what a magnificent bastard  nearly every man in the movie  in fact  is played as the same sort of sexdriven slimeball  when kinnears wife walks into the office  there isnt a single guy who doesnt trip  bump into a wall  or otherwise pratfall as if theyd never seen a woman before  the few guys that arent particularly slimeballs  such as john goodmans detective character  are simply uncommunicative workaholics  shandling meets up with annette bening  who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed  at one of kinnears aa meetings  shandlings mission is to have a baby  and when he reveals his desires to her  bening instantly falls for him  and the next day    they get married  yup  the next day  cuz ya see  it turns out she wants a baby too  benings character perhaps was the most difficult to watch  especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty    if her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the species as a whole  then woe  i say  to the species  shes unfathomably insecure  and succumbs so easily to all of shandlings lines and lies that it borders on tragic  theres a point where  after thinking she may not be able to bear children  she learns that she is indeed pregnant  when garry comes home after nearly cheating on her  she strolls into the kitchen and sings  high hopes   you know  the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song  to deliver the news  and then says to him   now you cant leave me   were supposed to empathize with shandlings discovery of the feeling of  guilt   but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing  and eventually  shandling falls in love with her    for real  i suppose  though im not sure exactly what prompted it  whats the message i derive from all this  men are liars  inherently empty creatures  but if you hang around long enough    well  maybe something will click  ha ha    ha  im thankful such broad cynicism isnt frequently allowed to run so rampant  lets all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one  theres also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity  goodman  through a series of astoundingly implausible realizations  puts together the fact that shandling is a being from another world with a magic  vibrating penis  it has all the makings for a subplot of having shandling be discovered  that  thankfully  never comes to the inevitable hackneyed fruition  instead  it just dangles limply on the branch for a while  withers  and falls away  further proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brothers movies  but lets not dwell on this any longer  ive already wasted plenty of your time and my own  lets move on  forget about what weve seen here  and get on with our lives  and to help us out  lets end things on a happy note    congratuations go out to annette bening  winner of this weeks  title   award  for delivering the awkward line of dialog containing the movies name  
1	plot  a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes  he is taken prisoner along with some other humans  and tries his best to escape his simian captors  oh yeah  and did i mention that the apes can talk  kewl  critique  despite this film not looking like a  tim burton movie  or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself  i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun  summer fare  although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape makeup jobs and characterizations  i mean  i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real  i also have to  give it up  to all of the actors inside the costumes  not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get makeup slobbered all over them for 24 hours  but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well  i especially enjoyed bonham carters performance  who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film  human or ape  and tim roths bad guy  who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part  plotwise  i liked the beginning of the film  the whole buildup once wahlberg got into the village  the escape and most of the fight scenes  but once things got out into the deserted area  and the final battle sequence   i kinda lost a bit of my interest  i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of  human beings as animals  then i was about the end battle sequence  which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film  i also hated the  kid  character who just got on my nerves and didnt really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved  i wont ruin it here but cmon guys    you coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that  no    but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character  his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his interspecies love interests  this dude didnt seem to give a rats ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didnt really care about what happened to him either  now im not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script  but the film suffered because of it  visually  the movie was also nice to look at  especially the apes    but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton  the  surprise ending  that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968  felt a little tacked on here  and despite being interesting  didnt really make all that much sense to me  unless you look at it from a sequel point of view   so overall  i loved the whole  feel  of the planet  the apes that ruled it  the manner in which they treated the humans  screamed  shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain  but didnt appreciate the films lack of human character development  why was kris kristofferson even in this movie   and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring  but i would still recommend this film as a fun  summer movie with laughs  creepiness and a really cool premise  ps  for anyone who has seen the original  i cannot believe that they didnt at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character  in this case  mark wahlberg  goes nuts at the world in which hes suddenly been thrust   this is a mad house    type of thing   the guy in this film barely seems to be  put off  by the fact that hes surrounded by apes who can speak english   wheres joblo coming from  the arrival  810   battlefield earth  710   godzilla  410   instinct  610   mission to mars  310   pitch black  710    1968  planet of the apes  910   sleepy hollow  810  
0	about an hour or so into  the jackal   a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence  and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out  i hope she gets killed now   at that point it hit me  i didnt care for any of the characters being played by actors i didnt really like  when the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because hes being played by sidney poitier  you know somethings rotten in the state of denmark  every year  a couple films like this are released  you know  the cheap  action packed international espionnage film  featuring a semipromising premise  some bigname actors  usually bruce willis   and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago  this was the third one of 97  following the very lackluster  the saint   which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe  and the surprisingly fun  the peacemaker   featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain    the jackal  tries to mix both elements  and you thought  the saint  was bad    the jackal  is loosely  very loosely  i hope  based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that ive yet to see   the day of the jackal   which featured  apparently  a suave hitman called the jackal  played by edward fox  trying to assasinate charles degaule  well  welcome to the 90s  where a sorta suave hitman  also called the jackal  bruce willis   trying to kill the head of the fbi    or is he  after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother  killed in the opening scenes   the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere  from helsinki to virginia  setting up an elaborate scheme wherein hell be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion  and like the saint  the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people  the agent working on the case  cater preston  sidney poitier  yes  that sidney poitier   working with a russian agent  valentina koslova  diane venora  lady capulet from  romeo  juliet    gives up early on and meets with an exira man  declan mulqueen  richard gere  putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of 97  whos in a massachusetts jail  but who has apparently seen the jackal  who has been eluding the law forever  soon  hes out working with the two untrusting agents  and trying to help them catch him  there are numerous problems with the film  and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on  the film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller  but save a couple moments  the film never achieves suspense  or even a sense of intrigue  sure  the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense  but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register  the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience  or even an entertaining one  it doesnt help that the plot is designed to be complex  but falls into so many problems  like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances  the script of  the jackal  is a complete mess  mostly because it cant decide what it wants to focus on  is this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer  is it a film about a nasty  amoral hitman whos in everything for the money  or is it a combination of both    the jackal  aims for the latter  but never focuses in on either character  the connection between the two feels completely edited  so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan  you wonder how he recognized him so fast  the worst part is the little past they try to give declan  most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend  isabella  mathilda may   given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then  the supporting characters are worse  sidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role  that of a man who is just stern sometimes  and other times more giving and likable  what is poitier doing here  hes one of the best living actors  does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this  diane venoras russian character is almost as bad  with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth  and a plastered on expressionless facade  its not that anyones bad here  its that they have nothing to do  the plot is a joke  feeling like it was pasted together by someone in postproduction who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time  the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain  there are several times where hes in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself  the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill  take a scene where hes being followed by some agents into a parking garage  he quickly sprays his car another color  and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it  doesnt killing someone attract more attention than it does distract  and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place  geez  is there anything good here  well    a couple things  i did like williss icy expressions  he may not have been real suave or anything  but some of his looks are worth a chuckle  richard gere has a couple of good moments  making his character as likable as he possibly could have  and a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous  completely inane but fun kinda way  most notably  a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder  jack black   and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man  which has its share of a couple good jokes  most particular a kiss by willis  but none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go  theyre just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is  the jackal   director michael catonjones  who directed the far superior  rob roy   has made a film that is made very couple months  one that is unentertaining  unintriguing  and pretty much cold  but will nevertheless make money because  hey  the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retroclancy kinda way  every now and then  the filmmakers get it right   clear and present danger   which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way   but  the jackal  is an example of when they go completely wrong  
0	  in dreams  might keep you awake at night  but not because of its creepy imagery  bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths  no  the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movies brutally squandered potential  the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise  even by tired serial killer genre standards  the big letdown  however  comes upon the realization that this 100minute headscratcher was masterminded by neil jordan  the man behind  the crying game   hes no stranger to cinematic weirdness  but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope  things start out strong enough  with cinematographer darius khondjis stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat  this eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film  theres even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic  seemingly innocent new england autumn  but if there ever was a film that didnt deserve so good a polish  its this one  dont knock the look  but say what you will about the foolish plot  underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue  annette bening  another asset  in dreams  shouldnt be so lucky to boast  gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesnt do much for her in return  she plays claire cooper  a massachusetts childrens book illustrator whos plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children  she thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible  soontobecommitted crimes  but neither her hohum husband  aidan quinn  nor the hohummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously  this being a thriller  we know that she is  in fact  on the money  and its a credit to benings acting that she delves equally into claires madness and compassion  but as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims   in dreams  trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense  scenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition  subplots appear and disappear  when claire finally comes facetoface with our evil murderer  robert downey jr    it turns out his name is vivian  hes clairvoyant and hes got some major issues with mama  a la norman bates    in dreams  reaches its absurdist zenith here  and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists  some questions  then  whats with the garbage disposal retching applesauce  are the drawings on the wall blood or paint  who cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own  what about the computer  does vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers  why would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan  is the woman in australia integral to anything  and the aforementioned flooded city  what function does that really serve  sigh  at least in my own dreams  i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didnt go to waste

1	  sometimes the green mile seems sooooo long   indeed  and any filmmaker with a three hour movie who ends it with that gem of dialogue should expect to see it quoted in a review  on a more positive note  let me add that sometimes the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget its length  the mile in question  green due to its faded limecolored linoleum  leads from the prison cell to  old sparky   the electric chair where executions were carried out at louisianas cold mountain penitentiary in 1935  paul edgecomb  tom hanks  youve got mail  is the head guard of eblock  otherwise known as death row  keeping his prisoners calm as they await the carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsibility  it is a responsibility which he capably delegates to the other guards on his watch by insisting they  talk to  the convicts instead of yelling at them  this practice leads to an unusual camaraderie between the guards and the men behind their bars  into his charge comes one john coffey  michael clarke duncan  armageddon   a seven foot tall gentle giant who has been convicted of the rape and murder of two young girls  immediately  paul senses something different about this prisoner  perhaps its the way he asked for a night light because he is frightened of the dark  or perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he  takes back  pauls bladder infection thereby restoring him to health  based on steven kings 1996 serialized novel  the green mile does offer other characters who have stories to be told  eduard delacroix  michael jeter  patch adams   is a frail cajun convict who befriends and trains a mouse to do circus tricks  percy wetmore  doug hutchison  a time to kill   is a young and sadistic guard sitting on a transfer to a more lucrative position because he has yet to see a prisoner  fry  up close  and hal moores  james cromwell  babe  pig in the city  is the compassionate warden for whom  despite all the executions hes witnessed  death never loomed as large as when his own wife was diagnosed with a tumor  while it is mr  hanks  everyman  performance at the center of the film which gives it the anchor to hold our interest for 180 minutes  it is the performances of his supporting cast that are most worth noting  all involved do credible work in their respective roles  most especially mr  duncan  who turns in an impressive  fully realized characterization  if only the story were more credible  writerdirector frank darabont  the shawshank redemption  has crafted a flawed fantasyallegory of sorts  one which is more spiritualistic than spiritual  relying on a preternatural mysticism rather than a genuine and godly spiritual power  mr  darabont also overplays his hand considerably in the manipulation of our affection towards and association with his characters  was it an accidental omission that the first two inmates who walked the green mile were being punished for crimes never disclosed  by not knowing the reason for the condemned convicts presence on eblock  the audience never gets the sense of the justice which is being carried out  making the death penalty appear cruel and unwarranted  this is especially true during the gruesome depiction of the second execution which was horribly botched  much has also been made of coffeys christlike ability to heal but unlike the numerous healings which are recorded in the scriptures  coffeys powers are shrouded in mystery  taking on the feel of a circus trick  coupled with a voodoolike  i feel your pain  transference  in contrast  there is no mystery associated with the healing that is from god  the genuine  gifts of healing  listed in 1 corinthians 12 is just one of the nine manifestations of holy spirit and can be operated by any spiritually instructed man or woman in accordance with the knowledge and wisdom of god  true spiritual healing  with few exceptions  requires the committed believing of both the healer as well as the one being healed  such believing comes not from the shrouded secrets of mysticism  but from the revealed word of god  
0	  you cant have any of this  its all mine    a twisted priest  charles huevelman  hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana  angela zimmerly  looks on uninterested  an evil presence  appropriately named the presence  dj vivona   rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him  for kicks  the presence likes to trick a human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered  when something goes wrong and one of the presences recent victims escapes  the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped  they enlist the help of alison  ramona midgett   a recent suicide victim  to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the netherrealm  her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was  an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed  the kings sorcerer  amblyn  who also lost his job   decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice  during the downtime in his unemployment  amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery  evil  and torture ruled  abraham wished to follow his master into this new realm  so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love  in this new realm  amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm  after each murder  abraham would become stronger  until his power surpassed that of amblyns  because of the screwup that allowed the recent escape  abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself  as alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways  the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered  if theres one thing i cant stand when i see a film  its when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty  films like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this  and now ice from the sun can be added to this list  this film is essentially an 80 minute stalkandslash film  following the dantes inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6  intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and  supposedly  haunting images  many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot  if there arent bizarre images floating past the screen  then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone  compelling  but ultimately not  the opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images  the credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesnt pop up until near the end of the sequence  when the opening credits began i thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and a interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv  at least the music in the film is pretty decent  made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett  at the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them  and he talks like a darth vader clone without the heavy breathing   for some reason though  he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance  one overalled cretin handles the presences gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel  then theres an inbred father  dwight spurgin  and his two inbred children  mark kettler and jennifer poirrierwallace  that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half doghalf human mix with a shotgun  and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds  why would you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of  rednecks  when you yourself had all of these cool powers  and how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time  i can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment  the most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned draggingsalting sequence  the character in question  dana  angela zimmely   has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated  a priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken  he picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken  taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever  when she starts to leave  the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life  walks out  and makes like it wants to be crucified by her  the presence starts to clap annoyingly  which continues for the rest of the sequence  until dana takes off with the strange creature following her  when it finally catches up to her  she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ  the box for the film claims  because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture  parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18  contains nudity and graphic violence   while both is certainly true  there doesnt seem to be much of either in any large amounts  besides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump  a semigraphic selfsurgery scene  and two instances of head trauma  one run over and one melting   most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety  as for nudity  it is very sparse  but at least we get to see angela zimmerly  far and away the most attractive cast member  before her body is bruised  torn  and bloodied by the dragging incident  ice from the sun has been released on vhs by www  bmovie  com  it has been presented in in fullframe only and the transfer  for a film shot a good deal in 8mm  is pretty decent  besides the decent soundtrack  which is also available from www  bmovie  com   a makingof video is also available called on thin ice  i havent had the opportunity to see the documentary  but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed  if only to see how director eric stanze  director of a similar cult film called savage harvest   conducted the atmosphere on set

0	the word to describe sharon stone is  wonder   not that she is a wonder  but rather that i wonder how she can be so inconsistent  she has a dynamic screen presence in  basic instinct   turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in  casino   but possesses neither of those here  stone teams up with private school headmasters wife isabelle adjani to kill adjanis thoroughly unlikable husband  chazz palminteri   in a comedy of errors and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock  as in homage to read  steal from     it turns out that someone saw them or hes not dead or maybe    kathy bates turns in a credible  if unspectacular  performance as an investigative police detective  her character is a bit dull but realistic  although her actions at the end are puzzling  adjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation  its stone that is a disappointment among the actors  how can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films and come off as a blank in this one  costumed in skintight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone  she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring  not enticingly dangerous  even the threat  or promise   of a lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played out  on the positive side  there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive  that is if you can put up with stones cardboard cutout character and scenes directly lifted from hitchs movies  
0	ah  and 1999 was going along so well  too    shes all that  has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie ive seen so far this year  and quite frankly  i doubt ill see anything equally bad    at least  i  hope  i dont see anything equally bad     shes all that  tells the story of the most popular guy in school  played by freddie prinze jr   who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school  rachel leigh cook  into the most popular  that  right there  is problem 1  how many times have we seen this storyline  as cook comments near the end of the film   its kind of like  pretty woman   except without the prostitution   of course  had the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material  the wellworn storyline would have been a device to propell the movie forward  as it is  though   shes all that  relies  completely  on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead  theres not one original or interesting character in the film  either  and if that wasnt bad enough  theres not one good performance featured  the star of the movie  rachel leigh cook  is simply horrible  i usually dont like to get so personal  but in this case  i think it needs to be said  cook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable a time as i was  i was never convinced that she was a  nerd   and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary  the movie seems to be saying its better to be popular than to be who you are  as for freddie prinze jr   an actor i ordinarily enjoy  he too is quite bad here  he coasts through the film on socalled charm  and never establishes a real character  kieren culkin is here  too  as the brother of cook  and for some indiscernable reason  hes got hearing aids  no explanation is given and theyre never brought up  were we supposed to feel  sorry  for him just because he wore hearing aids  i dont think so  that single element of the film was one of the most offensive things ive seen in a movie in a long time    shes all that  sucks  thats what it boils down to  its not entertaining  and its not even a good time passer  the hour and a half running time goes by slower than a 5 minute hairremoval system informercial  and whats worse  it sends out a bad message to teens  it appears to be telling them   hey  it doesnt matter if youre happy the way you are  thats unimportant  if you want to  truly  be happy  dress in the latest fashions and act like a bubbleheaded moron   ugh

1	the second jackalbased film to come out in 1997  the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal   this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland  and is directed by a man who hailed from joblos own alma matter  concordia university in montreal  canada  the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal  but does not pretend to be 100 factual  plot  naval officer ramirez  quinn  gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal  in order to put an end to the actual militants radical activities  he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee  ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this  assignment   and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism  intrigue and doublepersonality syndrome  which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states   critique  great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to twohour runtime  admittedly  i wasnt a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film  and didnt expect much from this movie beforehand  but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments  as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line  the first hour is mostly just a buildup of things to come  and does offer a great characterization of the jackal  but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending  quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal  but didnt offer anything extraordinary  in my opinion  sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that theyve played in both of their respective careers of late  but nonetheless  appeared to relish the coldheartedness of their chosen characters  i didnt like performance put forth from quinns wife in this flick  but then again  she doesnt show up in most of the film  so that wasnt so bad  i did however enjoy director duguays interesting style and cinematic vision  this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences  but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer  i thought that was neat  having said that  i didnt think the first hour needed to be as long as it was  and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the  fake  jackal met with the  real  jackals girlfriend without much retrospection on her part  but all in all  not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre  little known facts  ben kingsleys real name is krishna banji  he stands 5  8  was born in scarborough  england  and won the best actor honor in 1982s academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi  many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal  canada  joblos haven of restfulness   donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland  is canadian  and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal

0	i have always been a fan of director neil jordan  from his early work  such as 1984s  the company of wolves   to 1992s  the crying game   and 1994s  interview with a vampire   his latest film   the butcher boy   is a return to his roots in ireland  but unfortunately  it is not a successful homecoming  told through the eyes of a 12yearold irish boy  francis  newcomer eomann owens   this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidedly unstable life  his father  stephen rea  is an indifferent alcoholic  his mother  fiona shaw  is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals  and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore  francis is the type of boy who always has a lot to say  but mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty  and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be a little psychotic  even capable of brutal murder  the premise of   the butcher boy   is one that could have very well been turned into a thoughtprovoking  disturbing motion picture  but somehow nothing works  francis is in almost every scene  but we learn very little about him  as if the film was distancing itself away from him when  i suspect  we were actually supposed to sympathize with him  this is definately not young owens fault  however  because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance  and is able to also seem menacing as well  the fact that we dont get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay  the supporting characters are no help  though  rea is wasted  and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son  or to anyone else for that matter  he usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout  shaw has a little bit more to work with  since she has one touching scene in which she talks to francis in a time of despair  but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her  and singer sinead oconnor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice  the pacing is all off in   the butcher boy   although the story could have been dynamite  it moves at a deadeningly slow rate  and i found my mind wandering every once in a while  it is also very episodic  because the developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs  at one point  francis is sent away to a juvenile prison  and an odd  possibly sexual relationship begins to develop between a priest and himself  but nothing comes of it  id rather think of   the butcher boy   as a brief diversion for director jordan  rather than a total misfire  he has already proven to be a strong director  but he lucked out with this latest film  what could have been a courageous  unsettling character study of an emotionally disturbed young boy  only manages to be an ineffective  uninvolivng bore  
1	much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of  lolita   made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made  over its use of pedophilia  and as such  its important to address it straightforwardly  before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed  as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years  lying around in vaults san a distributor  and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit  when seeing this film  after all the hoopla  keeping in mind that there are people  namely me  who are fans of the novel  who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation    well  you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution  whats even worse is that seeing this  lolita   especially the first time and if youre familiar with anything  lolita   is admittingly very anticlimactic  this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film  ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it  its really quite a film  perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne  although  really  look at its competition   flashdance    fatal attraction   and  indecent proposal    at least besides  jacobs ladder   ive seen this  lolita  twice  the first time  i wasnt so blown away  it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting  the second time  not really thinking about how ive waited for what seems like forever to see it and how im seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre  it really affected me emotionally  the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one  which is why its such a good novel  and why this is such a good film  the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14year old girl named dolores a  k  a  lolita is great because its not trash for the perverted but because its about human obsession with things that are out of ones reach  its protagonist  the comicallynamed humbert humbert  is not your average pedophile  but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies  the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology  something that will destroy us but that we cant live without  these ideas are all worked into this film nicely  but done in a way that is not heavyhanded at all  but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating  the focus of this film  and the reason for making it  it seems  was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images  and scenes which are blatantly overstylized  the tone of the book is a comical one  but its also a tragic one  and humbert  telling the story from his perspective  blows every single thing out of perspective  humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires  and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed  we get a sense that perhaps its by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed  he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14yearold love  and allows himself to embody her as lolita  he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions  and by the end  he has nothing but overlydramatic feelings for her  the story recognizes the extreme of this  almost out of a test  seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert  and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author  vladimir nabokov  wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions  and perhaps bring them to peace  the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end  when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey  we can easily sympathize and even identify with him  the opening and final images of the film are the same  and who hasnt done a similar action  that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us  this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen  the first time being filmed in  shock  1962  by stanley kubrick  who couldnt possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do  but did the next best thing  he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general  in that film  he used the traps of society as benefits  the studio demanded the final scene  that of a heinous murder  come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile    and when you see it  it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession  the censors wouldnt allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the  um  relationship between humbert and lolita  so kubrick decided to play it as comedy  but still allow the tragedy to seep through  looking at these two versions  especially after reading the novel  and we all know that when weve read a novel and see a film adaptation  we are bound to be angered by any size differences   its really impossible to compare them  they both go for different things  and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was  and although its true that several scenes are similar  and are thus up for comparison  overall its unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse  i have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is  and i wont say that here  however  this film is pretty amazing  mostly because hey  i loved the book  and this film nearly reminded me of it  it doesnt have nearly as much wit  a couple comical scenes  and even a lot of good chuckles  but just not totally witty   but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had  some of that is in the casting of the two leads  jeremy irons  with his deep  soft british voice and gentle look  is an amazing humbert  hes droll in a very unique way  and  well  no one can look distraught the way he does  he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience  and when he looks at lolita with love  and she looks at him with lust  you know that hes her prisoner for as long as he lives  and dominique swain  who plays the title character  is rather incredible  she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original  wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction  bratiness  and selfcenteredness that marks the character  its easy to see why she surrenders to humbert  she loves the attention  and knows that she can have her way with him at any time  when he denies her something  she blackmails him effortlessly  a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic   and when he stands up to her  she weeps and runs away  leaving humbert to follow her  there are two other minor characters in the film  one whos a road block in the beginning  and the other whos a reappearing threat to the relationship  the former is charlotte  lolitas mother  played by melanie griffith  in the book  charlotte is a monster of a woman  overbearing  constantly scolding her child  overlyreligious  and ultimately selfish  and shes the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal  at least in the beginning  as played by shelly winters in the original  she represented all these qualities  as played by griffith here  shes about half of them  its annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first  and even though griffith is not really bad  persay  shes nothing more  the other is clare quilty  the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita  and succeeds  but at a price  langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original  quilty was a comic character in the original  a threat in the form of many forms  popping in states of rambling  german  proning  and eventually drunk  langella takes the other route  allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed  and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots  and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending  the exact opposite of what we thought of him  as you can see  most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter  stephen schiff  but just parts of a whole new look at the novel  at least cinemawise  this version is beautiful  and perpetually saddening  the camera movements are stylized  and each shot is breathtakingly rich  the acting is for the most part wonderful  and when we watch it  we really get a sense that for humbert  who is telling the story  the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita  more importantly  it takes us right up the brink of emotion  then jumps right over it  by the end  with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car  following what he says is the only part of his life he doesnt regret  we feel that we all lose to something we can never have  
0	girl 6 is  in a word  a mess  i was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film  there was no sense of where the film was going  or any kind of coherent narrative  if there was a point to the film  i missed it  girl 6  by the way  is the way theresa randles character is addressed in the phone sex workplace  all the girls are known by their numbers  the plot  such as it is  theresa randle is a struggling n  y  actress  and eventually takes a job as a phonesex operator  she begins to lose contact with reality  as her job consumes her  also  she must deal with the advances of her exhusband  isiah washington   he is an ex con thief  and she tries to keep him away  while at the same time  its clear that she still harbors feelings for him  her neighbor  jimmy  spike lee  functions as the observer  mediating between the ex husband and girl 6  he also functions as a point of stability  as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex  the soundtrack  consisting of songs by prince  was jarring  it kept taking my attention from the film  not altogether a bad thing  ill grant you  as what was transpiring onscreen wasnt that riveting  for parts of the middle of the film  the music stayed blissfully in the background  in the opening sequence and one scene later in the film  however  the music was particularly loud and distracting  of course  ive never really cared for princes  or tafkap if you like  music  prince fans might love the soundtrack  but it will probably be distracting  even to diehard fans  of the performances  the only one that stood out was spike lees buddy character  jimmy  he was excellent as the alwaysbroke neighbor of girl 6  he should have stuck to acting in this film  there are several sequences that gave me the impression that hed like to be oliver stone when he grows up  there are scenes shot with different types of film  which are purposely grainy  and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stones natural born killers  in that film  they worked to propel the narrative  in this film  they just made me more confused  there are some amusing moments  and a few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phonesex industry the multibillion dollar industry that it has become  other than that  though  nothing much happens  there are a few intense moments  as when one caller becomes frightening  but even that is rather lackluster  im not the biggest fan of spike lee  though id agree that he has done some very good work in the past  in girl 6  though  he seems to be floundering  he had an interesting idea  a fairly good setup  and seemed to wander aimlessly from there  girl 6 earns a grade of d

0	edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back  and like his previous two  it is a workingclass relationship picture  however  unlike his previous work  the film dwells on a more personal story  and with a female protagonist  and in no looking back  he stumbles  making a slow  boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work  claudia  lauren holly  is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life  shes at a turning point in her life  and feels as if shes going nowhere  her boyfriend  michael  jon bon jovi   is broke and in a dead end job  if she were to marry him  shed never get a chance to escape this town  enter charlie  edward burns   claudias old flame  he skipped town several years before  without any explanations    even for claudia  he has come back to town to see her  and suddenly she is torn  should she stay with stable michael  and never escape her hometown    or should she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again  part of the answer lies in the character of her mother  blythe danner   who fell for the wrong man    and has spent her life pining for claudias father to return  now it seems that claudia is about to make the same mistakes  at only a little past ninety minutes  no looking back is rather short for its genre  unfortunately  it seems much much longer  the storyline is simple and uninspired  and theres a lack of energy to the whole proceedings  which makes the entire drama rather tedious  edward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame  theres no one to restrain his ego  which reigns unchecked  he walks into the room and lauren holly swoons    yeah  right  lauren holly does what she can with her central character  but we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions    and we never really care  bon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie  his acting talents are much greater than they might seem  but he is given a mostly bland and ineffective role to work with  theres not much to recommend in no looking back  its not that the film is bad    its simply boring  theres no zest in any aspect of the film  and no reason to spend ninety minutes watching it  
0	over 40 years ago  a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira  a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankinds nuclear testing  partly flight of fancy  partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry  gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo  a year later  gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things  a new name  a dubbed english track  and raymond burr  as godzilla  the film took on the rest of the world  thirty years later  toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things  yes  including raymond burr  and called it godzilla 1985  now its 14 years after tohos remake  and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run  in emmerichs godzilla  matthew broderick plays dr  niko tatopoulos  a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiationinduced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms  when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river  tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states  meanwhile  tatopouloss college girlfriend  audrey timmonds  maria pitillo   works in new york city as an assistant to a bigtime news reporter  shed like to be a reporter herself  and when godzilla comes ashore  she figures this is her big break  of course  with the big guy running amok in the city  niko and audrey are bound to cross paths  and are joined by victor  animal  palotti  hank azaria   audreys trusty cameraman friend  and phillipe roche  jean reno   an operative for the french government  whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place  together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla  with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nations premiere movie production companies  one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla  he didnt  right up there with the lost world  godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history  the plot is pretty much what we expect  the big dinosaurlike creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city  and its up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped  while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down  the script  however  is painfully bad  its fraught with lines so corny  they dont even belong in bmovies  and includes many character actions which make you think   you idiot   or  you stupid girl   i suppose when youve got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york  any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well  why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them  but is conveniently able to leap atop others  why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him  when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line  why do sidewinder missiles  which have small explosive warheads  blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla  why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f18 fighterbombers  when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two  okay  maybe the last one was a bit nitpicky  but hey  i was on a roll  broderick is usually a good actor  but in this film hes weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way  hank azaria does what he can  but dont expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage  like brodericks  azarias character is quite simply lacking in color  what really annoyed me was maria pitillo  who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting  casting must have been asleep on this one  the one bright spot here is jean reno  who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic  quite unlike what weve seem him do in the past  although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster  reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable  unfortunately  the same cannot be said of the other incongruities  the entire feel of the movie is tongueincheek  and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it  this results in a significant amount of parody  which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster  and ends up just producing a mess  most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief  and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously  although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture  what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens  if we cant take the characters seriously  the threat they face is an empty one because we simply dont care what happens to them  godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more lighthearted than it should be  far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters  but heres a behemoth running through the city  theres bound to be a lot of casualties  but instead godzilla is afflicted with the afterschool g  i  joe cartoon syndrome  where almost everyone seems to get out of harms way just in time  in a couple of scenes  godzilla briefly breathes fire  none of the characters even remark upon this ability  nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers  its as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes  godzilla can do this  just like in the old movie  consider another punch pulled  through creative script writing  you can make a sequel out of just about any movie  but the final scene in this one doesnt just leave the door open  it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently  it made me want to gag  emmerich should have done away with 90 of the humor and injokes and played this one as a straight action film  with an intelligently written screenplay  godzilla could have been so much more  however  by confusing the viewer with a ton of addins and parodies  the movie ends up being something that just doesnt work  now if they only had raymond burr     
0	my friend here in film school just made a two minutelong film for one of his classes that includes a staged anal rape scene  done by two guys and shot on the shadow of the incident  with a banana being used as the instrument of penetration  as sick as this all is  watching it is one of the most admittingly hysterical moments ive ever witnessed  sure  it may be in bad taste  but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to some but is riotously amusing to the rest  then theres  caligula   this film features incest  necrophilia  beastuality  anal rape  homosexual felatio of both sexes  elaborate and lengthy orgies  a greasedup fist forced up a mans rear  wine poured down a man whos had his urinary tracts tied off  a penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs  etc  etc  etc  this could very well be a respectable film  and if could have been had the following not occurred  a  the events were graphically shot in clear view  b  the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to  well  show  historical accuracy   c  the film was a 20 million dollar production with lavish sets  a rather impressive cast  and a whopping 2 12 hour running time  produced and funded by none other than bob guccione  owner of penthouse magazine   caligula  comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since  plan 9 from outer space  because underneath theres a sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified  but also brilliantly entertaining  after all  its not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments  but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry  no film should be discarded because its content  because film is never about what its about  its about how its about  as the old cliche goes   those who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with  caligula   and thats that its nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish  without a second of credibility in its mammoth running time    caligula  allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name  a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing    or so i guess  even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons  the film opens on the wrong note  of course  with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen  using the overused passage  what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul   depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer  fucking around with his own sister in a field  i suppose if one has to lose their soul  one has to have a soul in the first place   the plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula  disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell  a performance that does the opposite that his performance in  a clockwork orange  did  is next in line for the throne but cant wait for the current emporer  tiberius  peter o toole  ditto  only for his performance in  lawrence of arabia    his grandfather  to die    so he kills him and ascends to the throne  then he abuses his position  marries a woman  helen mirren  who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting  so he doesnt just have to sleep with his sister  a dreadful teresa ann savoy  there to be pretty  naked  and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with   abuses his position a little more  a little more  and a little more  and then  i believe  invades england  then is killed off  the filler  instead of recounting his life  is supposed to be  as guccione claims  the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome  complete with orgies  vicious deaths  and lots of nudity  but instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be  it instead becomes gucciones twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like  oh  isnt it great that they just loved having sex  and that they killed people so disgustingly  and wouldnt it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though its so blatantly real bad porn that ive completely convinced myself that its not  i mean  why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up  and its not just that its disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film  its that in a film where the entire feel its going for isnt felt  its also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time  the sets are lavish  but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this  but that doesnt matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a light meter was used at all  making this not only dark and ugly  but just plain dark  the camera operation is also the worst ive ever seen in my entire life  not only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever  but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them  then have them out of focus  the editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow  there is no writer to speak of  what the hell does it mean that its  adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal     but nevertheless  the dialogue is shit  so laughably bad that i cant in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face  my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius   he could go at any moment  but with care  he could last a year or so    the music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian  they use his gorgeous  adagio of spartacus and phrygia   ad nauseum   used in an attempt to give the film some emotion  but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere  the orgy scenes  and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo  are the result of reshoots by guccione himself  which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment  every five seconds or so  the film cuts to random nudity  as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated  x    john gielgud represents the only voice of sanity  walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra   im going to kill my agent  im going to kill my agent     and so on and so on  for over 2 12 hours  making  caligula  about as exciting and enriching as a three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying  guccione  in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking  arduous task to watch in its entirety that i doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage  throughout the entire film  the presence of guccione is easily felt  as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen  pretentiously looking down upon us saying  look what i can get away with  and if you dont like this  then youre a prig  and worse than that  you know nothing about history   uh huh  theres a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something thats artistically good  a film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last  that would probably make for a good film  but using historical accuracy as a licence to get away with any kind of disgustingfordisgustingnesssake acts is total  total bullshit  and all i can say is that guccione and the makers of this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism  and have developed a pathetic and sadistic taste for both  judging from this film  theres a film that came out in 1989 called  the cook  the thief  his wife  and her lover   a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway  also starring helen mirren   which deals with graphic sex  heartstopping violence and gore  and even a little cannibalism for good measure  that film not only never patronized its viewers  but also handled them in a way that was shocking  yes  but also  in a bizarre way  entertaining and totally involving  there were real characters there in a real situation  and best of all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not to get off on the fact that its going to be offensive to many  that film achieved everything it wanted to do  and has since retained a status as one of those cult films that is not only popular but actualy good  and its everything  caligula  might have been but  alas  wasnt  
0	im a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamsons work  he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain  with teaching mrs  tingle  his directorial debut  williamson has reached the end of his rope  what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here  the components are all there  including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to  but where are the thrills  the laughs  both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge  and what a shame that is  i loved the scream films  heck  i even enjoyed the scifi goofiness of the faculty  kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office  teaching mrs  tingle  a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers  may put an end to his reign  or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties  i still have my faith  but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past  the title character of his pet project is a vicious  uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously overthetop by british actress helen mirren  mrs  tingle is basically every students worst nightmare  a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hardworking of her pupils  the principal  michael mckean  is horrified of her  and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members  i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way  mirrens performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink  in other words  its a poor substitute for williamsons best work  the plot is a big problem here  material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director  the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann  an overachiever hoping to get a college scholarship  but typical mrs  tingle says her history project  which she worked on for countless hours  is laughable  later on while studying in the gymnasium  a classmate  barry watson  offers her a photocopied duplicate of mrs  tingles final exam  leigh anns best friend  marisa coughlan  encourages her to use it  alas  the old hag herself finds the three scheming  and snatches the test  and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning  in the morning    how convenient  the three students head to mrs  tingles house  attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh anns name  things get out of hand  and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle  the plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her  of course  not everything goes entirely to plan  besides pointless subplots involving the football coach  jeffrey tambor  horribly wasted   there is little by way of actual progress  there is no urgency to the situation  little tension or laughs are involved  the humor is completely inconsistent  after many of the jokes  the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze  you continue to await some momentum in the story  something that could possibly revive the slow pace  a moment like that never arises  williamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players  including the talented mckean and larry sanders vet tambor  and the beautiful vivica a  fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor  and then williamson disposes of her character entirely  on the plus side  holmes and coughlan are admirable  with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression   and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher  while everything is pretty lifeless  teaching mrs  tingle remains watchable  there are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again  but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script  mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching  she is convincingly evil and fun to watch  but even her gifted delivery cant save individual scenes that flounder in boredom  if there is one word for the movie surrounding her  it would be disappointing  basically  kevin williamson is his worst enemy here  his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated  not that his writing here is especially good   we will see  when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas  whether williamson is for real  
1	airplane  is considered among many to be the epitome of satire filmmaking  after all  its brought to us by one of the best known satire writingdirecting teams  even if most people dont recognize the names behind the films  they are bound to recognize the titles  airplane   top secret  the naked gun  and hot shots to name a few  but although the zuckerabrahamszucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977  airplane  remains the true cornerstone of their work  and their directorial debuts  in the seventies  disaster films seemed to be at an all time high  films like earthquake  the towering inferno  and the poseidon adventure were big hits  there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane  a series that spanned the entire decade  and so  in 1980  we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film  this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean      it had to do with bad fish  airplane  is the story of ted striker  robert hays   an exfighterpilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six  er  seven comrades  unable to stop living in the past  teds world fell apart  he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job  and eventually  as we begin this film  is getting dumped by his lover  flight attendant elaine dickinson  julie hagerty   in a desperate attempt not to lose her  ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working  unfortunately  she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her  which leaves him wallowing in selfpity  in the midst of it all  something happens  someone gets sick  then another  then another  soon  the whole plane is full of deathlyill chicagobound people      and when the pilots get sick  played by peter graves  kareem abduljabbar  and frank ashmore   who will save the day    gee  i wonder  of course the main draw here is the nonstop  whizbang  comedy  with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags  although i had seen this movie a few times before  i was still laughing thru the entire thing  the most fun character by far is the doctor  played by leslie nielsen  hes a dry  subtle  sterotypically straightfaced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film  in a film like this  youre not really expecting an elaborate production  so one cant complain about the amateurish quality  what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny  played by stephen stucker  this character is pointless  nauseating  and very unfunny  i dont know why he was put in there  and i dont think anybody will find a good excuse  and when the film nears an end  it slows down quite a bit  almost getting old  you gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long  aside from that  airplane  is really a topnotch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic  it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends  especially if they havent seen it  and if they ask what the plot is  just tell em  its a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film  but thats not important right now   if youve seen the film  youll understand    
1	have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally  at any given moment  in life  or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world  or outside of it  these thoughtprovoking questions are the subject of  final destination   which is the most riveting horrordrama since 1999s  the sixth sense   stylishly filmed and tautly directed by  xfiles  alum james wong  the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters  in accurately written  teenspeak   rather than overwrought  highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldnt use   all the while developing into a darkly foreboding  severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the lesssuccessful  but still suspenseful epilogue  at the start of the film  17yearold high school senior alex browning  devon sawa  is about to leave with his 40student french class for a field trip to paris  progressively getting a case of preflight jitters  he spots several mysterious  coincidences   including the departure time being 9  25  the same as his september 25 birthday  as well as hearing the john denver song  rocky mountain high  over the sound system in the airport bathroom    john denver died in a plane crash   alex grudgingly mutters to himself  once seated  alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff  and after causing a ruckus onboard  he  as well as six other students and a teacher  are thrown off  arguing in the airport lobby  alexs suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight  killing all 300 passengers  including the rest of their classmates  as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode  the fellow survivors  whom he has saved  treat him in varying manners  carter  kerr smith   the hotshot jock  holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate  alexs best friend  tod  chad e  donella   wants to stand by him but cant because of his fearful parents  the teacher  mrs  lewton  kristen cloke   is frightened by him  believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster  as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker  only outsider clear rivers  ali larter   who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alexs premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before  is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life  that is only the setup of  final destination   and the less said about what follows  the better  suffice to say  the film does  indeed  turn into a slasher film  albeit one that is more thoughtful than most  and replaces a knifewielding maniac for the neverseen granddaddy killer of them all  the grim reaper itself  the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes  and  final destination  surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years  graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner  they manage to occasionally be so intense you dont know whether to shrink down in your seat  tap your feet in nervousness  or turn away  devon sawa  a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999s underseen slashercomedy   idle hands   is even more of a charismatic presence here  the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival  which he comes to believe he wasnt meant to do  as well as the loss of the other passengers  is superbly and subtly acted on his part  one scene  in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful  ali larter  1999s  varsity blues    in the other central role  is also effective  as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before  leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish manthe exact opposite of her nowdeceased father  the other roles are not as fully written  and most remain rather onedimensional  the movie is mainly sawas  however  and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles  tony todd  1992s  candyman    as an arcane morgue attendant  pops up for a fiveminute cameo  but his appearance is rather supererogatory  and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye  while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy  ultimately  what is so good about  final destination  is that  within the confines of the slasher genre  writerdirector wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner  and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frightentwo things that are rarely found in todays horror films  if anything  its safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again  
1	i feel no hesitation in saying that  theres something about mary  is the best film that i will see all year  from the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture  there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998  it is that good of a film  when gene siskel said this about  fargo  only a few months into 96  i dismissed the notion as ridiculous  how could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it  but after seeing the farrellys hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork  i now know what siskel was talking about  once in a  very great  while  a film comes along that is so daring  so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end  you just want to stand up and cheer  and you know  at that instant  that you have just experienced something very special  now for the shocker   mary  is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed   pink flamingos  obviously notwithstanding   the movie is so rude and  i guess  inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents  luckily i had seen it before them  so i could warn the about what they were in for   forget  blazing saddles    animal house  and even the former king of grossout comedy   monty pythons meaning of life   they were all only preludes to the farrellys assault on the senses  in fact  this may even be the funniest film ive ever had the pleasure of seeing  the only real contender is  monty python and the holy grail    and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade  but as funny as it is  something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of  mary   it has a huge heart  you see  the farrellys are truly gifted filmmakers  they dont just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes  although there are plenty to go around   they also  very wisely  add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses  its funny  though  if you just look at an outline of the story  it seems kind of contrived and predictable  but believe me  it is anything but  ben stiller plays ted  a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe  mary  cameron diaz   after he sticks up for her retarded brother  warren  w  early brown  the cameraman  believe it or not  from  scream    his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom  in one of the films funniest scenes  something goes wrong  i wont ruin it for those who know nothing about the film  and ted is unable to face mary ever again  jump to the present  after years of selfloathing  ted finally hires private detective pat healy  a suitably slimy matt dillon  to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school  healy finds that mary is still a fullblown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself  admittingly  the basic story line leaves a little to be desired  after all  with a notreallyallthatfunny premise  how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours  somehow  the farrellys pull it off  the performances here are also right on target  as ted  stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating  as he would normally be  but very lovable  and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons  but the actor who really grabs your attention is w  earl brown as marys brother  no other actor has even come close to playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here  i know he wont be nominated  but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february  as good as the actors are  though  its the directors movie all the way  i guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year  you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielbergs wwii epic  saving private ryan   and yes  that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting  but which is harder  making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they cant breath for minutes at a time  ill let you decide that one for yourself  but this critic is sticking to his guns  there is just something about  mary   
0	this was the last carry on movie  if you discount carry on columbus as a carry on movie  and was made by a new production company  based in central london  this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert  suzanne danielle  to bed her husband emile the french ambassador  kenneth williams   when he seems unwilling  she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes  such as the prime minister and the u  s  ambassador  her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages  she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead  meanwhile  theodore valentine  larry dann  is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her  however  she is only interested in restoring her husbands ardour which seems a little difficult after emiles accident with a church spire  this film is the second worst carry on movie  the worst being carry on england  it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written  newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid  as mrs  valentine  are mildly funny  but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad  kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted  given the script  the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler  joan sims as mrs  dangle  kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur  and peter butterworth as richmond  are worthless and embarassing  in fact  all four parts are surplus to requirements  however  the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades  an awful script  a terrible collection of jokes  very poor production values  especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st  james palace   a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score  and a nonexistent plot or storyline  its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next  jack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring  joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted  and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile  a complete waste of time  this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies  it was a certificate 15 film but by 1978  there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april 1998  avoid at all costs  
0	ever watch a very young child try and tell a joke that is beyond his  or her  sophistication  its full of stops and starts and usually  the punch line is ruined  i felt the same way watching drowning mona  skip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy  there are some slightly successful attempts at humor  but they only serve as window dressing  there is a running gag about the town  verplanck  n  y   being a test town for the then new yugo  everyone drives a yugo  differentiating their cars with personalized license plates  even the police chief drives one  there is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets  there also is a running gag about one of the characters  jeff  missing a hand and how it occurred  it pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends  it turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend  there are some sight gags that pop up as well  such as monas tombstone  which reads  demoted   instead of devoted  still  the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond  the lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona  midler   each scene with her is the same  scream at someone  hit someone  then scream some more  theres no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness  anyone off the street could have played the role  such as it is  the other characters are walking cardboard cutouts  each one is defined by one trait and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization  there is a burly  female car mechanic  so of course  there is a forced lesbianism gag  monas son  jeff  marcus thomas  is a simpleton  hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth  chief of police rash  devito  likes broadway musicals and loves his daughter  theres nothing more to him  elle  the chiefs daughter  campbell   is bland personified  a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child and be married  monas husband phil  fichtner  jeckle and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch  bob  affleck   elles betrothed  and business partner to jeff  is a mumbling  obvious dullard  there is no contrast to any of the characters  by having at least one character with some wit  or wits  to serve as counterpoint to the others  perhaps steinfelds attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better  ostensibly a murder mystery  drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately  then lets you sit back and feel superior as you watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer  who could be anyone due to monas loving manner with everyone on town  even that aspect of the film fails  throwing in a convenient  ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things  its been a while since i walked away from a movie theater in an angry mood  what makes it all the more remarkable is that i rarely remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at its ineptitude  
1	youd think it would be easy to spoof star trek  but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it  thats a bit more difficult  the farfetched scifi series is  after all  enormously popular  what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies  if youre not nice to it  you lose  galaxy quest is to star trek what mel brookss spaceballs was to star wars  an affectionate  riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems meanspirited or malintentioned    the shows been cancelled  but the journey is far from over   that is the current tagline of  galaxy quest   a star trek  type show thats no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns  it also lives on in conventions  gatherings of the shows obsessive fans who never fail to dress in  galaxy quest  costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble  jason nesmith  tim allen  played  commander peter quincy taggart  on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do  the attitudes of the rest  tommy webber  daryl mitchell  gwen demarco  sigourney weaver   fred kwan  tony shalhoub  and alexander dane  alan rickman   range from indifference to utter contempt  dane  who played a spocklike alien  is especially disgusted  considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his characters cheesy trademark line  by grabthars hammer  you shall be avenged   or something like that  for his diehard fans  one day  nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of  galaxy quest  followers  they are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia  they have mistaken the  galaxy quest  episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel  the next day  the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris  named  in one of the films only meanspirited gags  after village voice film critic andrew sarris   nesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig  and sort of blows it off  but when he is transported  or i should say shot  back to earth in a rather celestial manner  he believes  next thing the cast knows  they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship  of course  they all think he is out of his mind and once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship  what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them  but after some persuading  they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians  i was quite surprised how well this comedy  which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign  worked  taking shots at both the obvious and notsoobvious elements of star trek and its fandom  galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs  opting instead for broad but smart parody  nothing is safe  not the cliches  not the fans  not the absurd taglines  but on the other hand  everything is safe  since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration  the highlight of the movie is tony shalhoubs fred a  k  a  tech sergeant chen who  when in character  is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek  while scotty  who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell  i need more power down here captain    chens cry for help is more to the tune of  the core  like  wont take it or something   its a hoot  but it doesnt stop there  weaver  whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the computer says and rickman  with his relentlessly holierthanthou attitude arent far behind  galaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while its not a masterpiece  it tends to falter in its more serious moments  it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season  by grabthars hammer  this is a hell of a movie

1	if beavis and butthead had a favorite movie  from dusk till dawn would probably be it  scripted by quentin tarantino and directed by robert rodriguez  desperado   the movie panders to the very worst in sex and violence  and is incredibly fun to watch  it starts off as a pulp fictiontype crime story  with criminal brothers george clooney and tarantino robbing a convenience store  because this is a tarantino movie  however  its not just a case of pull the gun and take the loot  its a case of a hole being shot through someones hand  a man on fire jumping out behind the counter and the entire store blowing up as they drive away  the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie  everything overdone and nothing as it seems  clooney and tarantino bring a hostage to the motel and then hijack an rv with a family in it  harvey keitel plays the backslidden expreacher and juliette lewis his daughter  whom registered sexpervert tarantino eyes endlessly  you know youre mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive  although shes not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn  the first half of the movie has the criminals and hostages trying to get to and through the mexico border  clooneys strategy involving hiding in the rv shower while lewis is on the toilet  it does its trick  the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself and immediately goes blind  never noticing clooney or tarantino  once they get to mexico  its time to wait at the rendezvous point  a topless bar called titty twister where were once again reminded tarantino wrote the movie as he drinks champagne off the foot of a stripper  finally  after about ten minutes of intercut boob shots and clooney forcing keitel and lewis to drink with him  the stripper turns into a vampire  soon half the people in the bar are vampires and the other half fall or fight back  thats right  weve come all this way to see a vampire movie  but like everything else  tarantino takes this ageold genre and twists it to his own ends to produce overthetop entertainment  so we get holy water condom balloons  heads rolling  quadruple impalement on an overturned table and keitel getting bitten by a vampire and announcing he only has a few minutes left before he becomes  a lap dog of satan   the from dusk till dawn dialogue is 100 tarantino  hovering between absurd and disgusting  as when theyre entering the nightclub and cheech marin announces the main attractions of the titty twister   but always entertaining  and is a huge reason the movie is so much fun to watch instead of being one more secondrate gorefest  clooney  keitel and especially tarantino are so overthetop with their delivery that the dialogue is that much more hilarious  ensuring not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit seriously  stuff like this would be terrible in any other movie  but tarantino and rodriguez know exactly what to do to entertain people  even if theres absolutely no message or meaning to from dusk till dawn  pulp fiction had the vulgarity and violence for a reason  but this movie just throws it out for cheap entertainment  from dusk till dawn isnt the classic of modern cinema that pf is  but is does prove you can do a good job making a really bad movie  
1	the reunion film is not an original idea in any way  shape  or form  its been done throughout film history over and over again  and has become one of the many subgenres  like the prep school subgenre  the angstfilled teen subgenre  and the slasher subgenre  what makes  peters friends  so remarkable is not how it doesnt follow the rules of this subgenre  but how it follows it so well  and creates characters that i wouldnt mind hanging with  what are the rules of the reunion subgenre  well     1  you need a group of friends  most of them married or at least dating  and sometimes even married or dating eachother  2  you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis  3  they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart  4  the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10  5  they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic  6  the reunion has to bring them together  seperate them with little crises  then bring them back together because  after all  theyre friends  7  there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited  8  eightly  theyre all unhappy or marginally so  9  theres some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them thats built up over the years  10  the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts  sometimes internationally so  11  the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends  sometimes causing them to get together in dancesong  since it follows these rules so closely  it will probably be  and has been  coined off as just a  british big chill    and in some ways it is  both follow the rules  as i said  and both feature lots of bitching  big confessionals  and broken relationships  but while  the big chill  was  at least to me  a tad too whiny and unsatisfying   peters friends  hits its mark  making this film funny  dramatic  and poignant  the friends of peters were all in the same theatre group back in 82  performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them  the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus   after peters  stephen fry  wealthy father  richard briers  hardly on screen enough to register  but oh well  dies  leaving a giant mansion to him  he has to decide whether or not to keep it  not sure what to do with it immeadiately  he decides to throw a giant reunion party  inviting back all his old chums  of course  all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule  andrew  kenneth branagh  also directing here  is an actor whos unhappily married to a tv star  carol  cowriter rita rudner   maggie  emma thompson  is a successfuly publisher of selfhelp books  but looks like she needs them more than her customers  as she is lonely and unhappy  roger and mary  hugh laurie and imelda staunton  who were also married in  sense and sensibility   are married  and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk  but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died  and sarah  alphonsia emmanuel  is as promiscuous as ever  having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian  tony slattery  whos married and wants a divorce because of her  giving her doubts  as for peter  things seem okay    the film features lots of innerfriend jokes  and even some old theatre anecdotes  which i at least find a lot of fun in  as ive done lots of theatre myself   and there are big confessions  brawls between the friends  and by the end  almost everyone is unhappy  even though some have resolved their problems long before the end  which i kinda dug   the final twist would seem forced an anticlimactic  but for some reason  i felt the same way the rest of the friends did  maybe its because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique  thats really what makes  peters friends  so lovable  the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes  but when someones in crisis  can come together wonderfully for one another  its when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends  and these people are true friends  not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s  a decade i grew up in  unfortunately  without taking us outside of the 90s  there are some 80s classics and anticlassics like tears for fears  everybody wants to rule the world   but unfortunately no stupidfun 80s songs  i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film  id put some crap go gos song on  or at least some good old  come on eileen    but this is the british 80s were talking about  oh well  but anyway  the direction is pretty good  although nothing amazing  branaghs forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical  but at least hes very good with making a less ambiguous film like this  the writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman  with lots of good oneliners  and even some really bad but good puns  to mock the fact that andrew lives in l  a   peter  while cutting some logs  asks him is he has wood in l  a   and andrew says   no  but we have hollywood   punishment like that   the actors  as in most speaking movies  are better than their material  though  with some standout performances to the six friends  as well as the outsiders like slattery  rudner  and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peters mansion  a little note should be made about hugh lauries performance  as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this  i mean  ive never seen him actually act this dramatically    peters friends  is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion  although i dont know what kind ill have  like most people  i dont look forward to my high school reunion   because of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation  i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that  
1	synopsis  captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600  the baku  from the evil admiral dougherty and ruafro  the enterprise crew  in the meantime  experience the rejuvenating qualities of the baku homeworld  lt  worf grows a pimple  data sings opera pieces  picard scores with a baku chick  riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi  and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts  comments   star trek  the next generation  was a hugely successful sequel tv series to  star trek   a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s  even though it still enjoyed high ratings   star trek  the next generation  ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original  star trek  s cast in paramounts film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise  star trek  insurrection is the ninth  star trek  movie and the third to focus on the  star trek  the next generation  crew  star trek  insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans  such as myself  would rate somewhere between  okay  and  good   after star trek v  the final frontier  a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant  star trek  voyager  tv series   star trek  fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise  i dont wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies  most people reading this probably havent followed  star trek  anyway  so a comparison would seem tedious at best  let me  thus  make my comparisons briefly so that its out of my system  star trek  insurrection is not as good as the previous installment  star trek  first contact  star trek  insurrections comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv  the voyage home  star trek ii  the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie  okay  lets move to the movie itself  star trek  insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise  humanitys exploration and colonization of space  with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners  this combination works well more often than it fails  but when it does fail  the humor really seems cheesy  much of this film appeals to trek fans nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprises crew  audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times  star trek  insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the baku homeworld  forget the actors and special effects  the beautiful setting of this movie  with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys  steals the show  this tranquility  however  is broken by data  an android  who reveals to the baku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies  the sona  it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth  sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young  healthy state  the enterprise crew  led by captain picard  investigates datas actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the sona and an enterprise admiral to relocate the baku and plunder the planets youthrestoring properties  sound pretty heavy  it is  though this plot  anything but unique and groundbreaking  is undermined by the films constant barrage of humor  when going after data  for instance  picard sings an opera piece with him  this is supposed to be cute and humorous   in a much more funny sequence  work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the baku homeworld  a pimple which his crewmates  try as they might  cannot avoid looking at  the acting in star trek  insurrection is  for the most part  pretty good  since theyve been playing these characters for years  those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough  the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jeanluc picard and delivers a moral speech  picards trademark  with his usual aplomb  brent spiner  another fine actor  plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film  though the old androidwishingtobehuman motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series   the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good  despite many other critics negative opinions  f  murray abraham  the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus  plays the major villain ruafro well enough  ruafro reminds me  somewhat  of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune  like the baron  ruafro continuously has his skin looked after  it is stretched and stapled by servants  in one particularly memorable scene  ruafro becomes very agitated  and his facial skin splits open and bleeds  ruafro is no khan from star trek iithe best trek villain everbut he is much better than the forgettable dr  soran from star trek  generations    okay  i promise  no more comparisons   donna murphy must also be noted as a baku woman  anij  who picard falls in love with  murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body  she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance  this is the type of woman whom picard  for those who know the character well  would be enchanted with  in fact  the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here  a particular plot point involving anijs ability to slow time down  an ability which she shares with picard  becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie  for as good as the actors and setting were  star trek  insurrections special effects were surprisingly disappointing  they proved adequate  sometimes barely  for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film  but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars  the phantom menace  a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection   the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships  in particular  seemed trite and unsuspenseful  and the final confrontation between picard and ruafro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite  the new enterprise itself  only seen in this film and its predecessor  remains largely unexplored  though its exterior doesnt look quite right for a reason i cannot explain  despite star trek  insurrections frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects  i enjoyed the film  it maintains roddenberrys largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors  particularly star trek  first contact  though  dont get me wrong  the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully   id recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon  especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general  rated pg  i cant see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience  young or old
