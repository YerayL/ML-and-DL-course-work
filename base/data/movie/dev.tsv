1	originally launched in 1978  this popular film was reintroduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers  based on the mighty successful musical from broadway  grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2  6  510   starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles  plot  highschool musical set in the 1950s showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the tbirds  travolta  and the innocent and pure sandy olsen  newtonjohn  from australia  the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song  dance and humour  critique  funloving  energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler  this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950s  with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers  admittedly  i am somewhat biased in this opinion  since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth  grease was one of schmoes first bigscreen experiences  and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubblegum card collection   and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time  but apart from the nostalgic vibe  i was still extremely impressed by this film  as it continued to amuse me  despite my previous dozen or so viewings  this film took john travolta from a dimwitted  sweathog  on tvs welcome back kotter  and transformed him into a moviestar of spectacular proportions  saturday night fever  7  510  in 1979 confirmed that sudden popularity   unfortunately for the rest of the cast  his popularity was not terribly contagious  despite their effective showings in this classic movie  on the down side  some of the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn people off  like when sandy sings about  drinking lemonade  and  staying out until 10  with danny in  summer nights    and the plot isnt exactly the most elaborate storyline ever created  but despite these small reservations  this movie carries enough great music and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid 110 minute running time  and believe me    i am not a fan of the musicals     make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player  as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the films absolute highlights  and dont forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards  so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever youre feeling a little blue  little known facts  henry winkler  of tvs happy days fonzie fame  turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want to be typecast for the rest of his career  both travolta and conaway were smitten by newtonjohn during the filming of this picture  conaway eventually bowed out of the woofest  and married newtonjohns sister a year later  divorced after five years   
0	  tina    fetch me the axe     a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981  paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands  it wasnt just the films disappointing box office performance  indeed  in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two  three  even six times  no  the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year  in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events  some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming   mommie dearest  the biggest mommie of them all    executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn  but it was all too late  mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history  unfortunately  faye dunaways energetic  at times ridiculously overthetop performance is about the films only redeeming feature  based on daughter christina crawfords trashy biography  mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother  if you believe this movie  it was a life was racked by obsession  lonliness  child abuse and rampant egomania  the film begins with crawford adopting two children  and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grownup daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mothers will  joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves  you see  but thats about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the films end  the script  laboured over by four writers  a bad sign in itself  is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum  frank perrys direction is no more than competent  and dunaways bitchy lines aside  the dialogue is flat and uninvolving  in fairness  the films second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters  when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling  joan visits and keeps in touch  not helping her financially but encouraging christinas own acting and career ambitions  crawford does seem to care about her daughter  but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain  you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers  ah  but there is dunaways performance  and what a delicious piece of campery it often is  having just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds  crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden  she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess shes making  spotting a young tree she doesnt like the look of  she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line  tina   fetch me the axe    with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling  in the films most outrageous scene  joan realises that some of her daughters clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers  oh dear  sounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum  doesnt it  this time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst   no    wire    hangers     ever       and later  when the board of her late husbands company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship  she displays a superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring   dont fuck with me  fellas     oh joy  something of a camp classic  then  but if thats not youre cup of tea then mommie dearest doesnt have too much to recommend it  better you see the real crawford in the women  1939   mildred pierce  1945  or whatever happened to baby jane  1962   great films distinguished by great performances  and a far more eloquent testament to this great woman than frank perrys shrieking piece of tabloid froth

0	  something is fishy in the state of universal   about ten years back  with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior  postapocalypse nittygritty survival yarns became popular at the movies  weve always had movies of this nature  on the beach  the end of the world  damnation alley  the ultimate warrior  and so on  to date  the most smoothly done were straightforward  haircuts  of the classic western plot  like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization  usually one in possession of some critical resource  like water  feed range  or a mining claim  most of these grew out of venerable  but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane    my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn  which was fairly well made on a small budget   now we have waterworld  which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter    well  shes not a widow  and the kid isnt her daughter  but you get the idea   the lady is helen  played by the stunning jean tripplehorn  who isnt given a chance to be stunning  or even interesting  by the mediocre and unimaginative script  the child enola  played by tina majorino  is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie  she outshines her material all the way through  in simple  the scene is earth  hundreds of years from now  the polar ice caps have melted  and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet  the few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies  and survive by trade  theft  or piracy  somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries  and its inhabitants  called  smokers   are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials  so the bad guys have outboard engines  and fastmoving boats  airplanes  and jet skis  enola  found at sea as a young girl  has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back  we suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical  dryland   the place where trees  crops  and animals grow  and what plot there is hinges on who has enola  the psycho ruler of the smokers  the  deacon   is trying to get her and find his way to dryland  played with typical selflampooning  rugchewing histrionics by dennis hopper   deacon  is the only thing in the movie thats close to amusing  his performance is  almost  laughable  but there just isnt enough there to be funny  the star  and a coproducer  is kevin costner  hes playing an unnamed lone denizen of the sea  a man called the  mariner   who turns out to be a gilled  waterbreathing mutant with webbed feet  very little is done with this  the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism  it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted  much of the earths surface would still be above water  and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown    canned meat does  not  last for centuries  ammunition does  not  fire after its more than a few decades old  and so on  and so on     im quite fond of tina majorinos previous work  very impressed by jean tripplehorns past accomplishments  and still speechless over costners dances with wolves  but this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it  this movie cost one hundred and eightytwo million dollars  and theres  nothing  in it we havent seen before  done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey  at 125 minutes of material  this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make  the budget of this movie  could  have given us over thirty movies  it could have paid for six years of a primetime sf tv series with expensive fx work  or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx  in sum  this movie is beneath contempt  it has nothing new to offer  it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc  and it spent more money than the national budget of a small nation  if you  have  to go see it  see it on a fourdollar matinee  otherwise youll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface  for weeks

1	by now i figured id seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a halfdozen times  not that im complaining  to call him the  master of suspense  is an understatement  the paradine case  1947   admittedly one of hitchcocks lesser movies  turned out to be one id missed  this one  like all hitchcock films  is well worth savoring  the story opens with the rich mrs  maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband  as mrs  paradine  alida valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world  to franz waxmans stark and moody music  we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels  stripped of her fine raiment  she becomes a commoner again  which  as it turns out  was what she was before she met her husband    a brief skirmish  and youll be lunching at the savoy again   anthony keane  her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting  predicting a fast and easy trial  gregory peck plays the successful and debonair barrister    shes no murderess   he argues simplistically  smitten by her beauty    shes too fine a woman   his attitude upsets his beautiful and increasing jealous wife  gay  ann todd   unlike most hitchcock movies  which are centered on the thriller and the mystery  this one is more a romantic melodrama  typical is the scene in which gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while bathed in light  she deflects her husbands affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client  the dramatic music then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs  paradines portrait nearby  in the relatively unsatisfying first half  little happens other than domestic squabbles and overtones of intense adulterous desires  to the sound of sweeping violins gay tells anthony that he must get mrs  paradine acquitted because  if mrs  paradine dies  his heart will go with her  if she is freed  he will be able to forget her  as part of the soap opera  a mysterious louis jordan plays mr  paradines valet  who has had some not to be discussed relationships  charles coburn plays anthonys legal partner  sir simon flaquer  and charles laughton  who looks like coburn  is judge lord horfield  this being proper british society  they will all dine together at the judges house not long before the case begins  court tv junkies will probably pick up the many differences  some subtle and others not  between the american and the british judicial systems  one  for example  of which i was not aware is that the barrister cannot speak to his own client during the recess if she is the process of testifying  one sometimes wonders what the academy is thinking when they make their oscar nominations  as the judges wife  lady sophie horfield  ethel barrymore got a nomination for best supporting actress  the films only nomination  for an inconsequential part with which she did little of merit    so the big question is when does hitchcock make his obligatory walkon  at 37 minutes into the film  he leaves a train station carrying a large musical instrument case  dont miss it   in the second half the story finally comes alive when it gets into the courtroom  the great master shows his hand there as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first  watch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back and other times from way on high to set the exact tone for the trials action  as anthony explains it  the simple case has only 3 possibilities  mr  paradine poisoned himself  mrs  paradine did it  or the valet did it  the end includes many devastating revelations and some nice twists so it is too bad the first half is so languid  the paradine case runs 1  53  the picture is in black and white  it is not rated but would be pg for mature themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up if they are interested

0	you know  i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man  while watching instinct  i couldnt help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the wellexplored themes of those earlier movies  even beside the tarzan comparison  instinct just isnt a very good film  its painfully idealistic  manipulative  and silly  i didnt hate it  its simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins  furthermore  most of the acting is quite good  but i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved  i can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct  and its pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams  things start off in the predictable way  as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero  theo caulder  cuba gooding  jr    an ambitious  young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced  old psychiatrist  donald sutherland   caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life  the one he thinks will make him famous  the subject is ethan powell  hopkins   an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years  powell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa  and its now caulders job to find out of hes mentally competent enough to stand trial  through a series of short sessions  caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell  even though it really is an old man version of tarzan  much of this central idea is rather interesting  as i said  hopkins is captivating for every second hes on screen  he has a way of convincing us that hes not acting  that hes actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas  the character himself isnt very interesting  hes just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas  but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action  gooding jr  does strong work opposite hopkins  playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual  the screenplay  written by gerald di pego and  suggested by  a novel by daniel quinn  gives us no background information on caulder  but that seems to be the point  he has no time for friends because hes obsessed with his work   nonetheless  these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct  unfortunately  filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting  turtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instincts artistic failure  for they work together to make the dumbest  most clicheridden environment in which their characters are to live  and they do so by means of brainless subplots  first  we have the prison warden subplot  the prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulders progress at any cost  if this means taking caulder off the powell case  then thats fine  theres also the prison guard subplot  the prison guard is played by john ashton  the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision  and hes instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion  then theres the daughter subplot  in which maura tierney  playing the daughter  must look very upset a lot of the time  after all  she is the daughter of a deranged man  if some of this stuff sounds familiar  thats because theyre all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films  the evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here  the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoos nest had  ashtons evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy browns in the shawshank redemption  hopkins performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs  and then theres the whole tarzan thing  which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film  perhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the halfhearted attempt at philosophical depth  the message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one  he thinks that humans are  takers   that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas  i can sympathize with that  but only when its in a compelling film  this is the kind of stupid movie  just like patch adams  in which a big group of characters  psychotic inmates  in this case  rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards  what does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas  if all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor  we would have had a thirtyminute movie far superior to the twohour one that i watched today  if the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise  then we would really have had something interesting  a movie that doesnt rely on the strength of its actors  
1	it must be some sort of warped critical nightmare  the best movie of the year would be a summer vehicle  a jim carrey vehicle at that  and so it is  the truman show is the most perplexing  crazed  paranoid and ribtickling morality play ive seen since idontknowwhen  dont credit carrey  it starts with andrew niccol  gattaca   who created the script ten years ago  the story  replete with sublte religious and philisophical undertones  is about a man who discovers that every day of his existence has been televised for a mass audience    ironically  it was within these past ten years that  realitybased  television have become a predominant fixture into our culture  who knew   oneupping niccol  it was when unlikely candidatedirector peter weir took the helm that things fell into place  weir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone  deftly mixing capra with kafka  throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling  it was weirs first stroke of genius to create seahaven  a suburban paradiseprison that would make spielberg cower in shame  for example  bystanderextras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers along with the latest issue of dog fancy  the nicest touch are the plethora of subtle hints for truman to not leave the island  credit weir for his second stroke  the casting of carrey  carrey seems to be the type of character actor who would always turn  on  and act goofy whenever the camera is near  not here  his performance is so subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on  and although carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination  just as well  the academy rarely honors goofy comedians  excepting robin williams   he stretches enough to alter his hypersilly image considerably  playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of jim carreys life  no pun intended  better in a smaller  more pivotal role is ed harris as christof  who mixes the right amount of his apollo 13  work the problem  people  character with dustin hoffmans megaglomaniac producer in wag the dog  and then only slightly svengalian  it is clear that he is torn between the nielson ratings and trumans well being  yes  in his own misguided way he loves truman as a father to a son  and has provided the best universe he could provide  he thinks  rounding out the cast is natascha mcelhone  mrs  dalloway  as carreys true  forbidden love   sylvia  very effective in another pivotal small role  laura linney  congo  and noah emmerich  copland  have the unfortunate task of playing trumans wife and best friend  their sitcomish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character development  the exception is at the very beginning  where they speak into the camera  wholeheartedly believing that their participation is truly good for truman  and for society in general  there are other little problems with the script  are we to assume that toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years  was there any reason as to why in one scene  it rained solely on truman  even though it never had to  how is it they hire hundreds of extras  and none of them could drive a boat  and yet truman  fearful of water  is helming a sailboat effortlessly  and couldnt christof have turned off the wind  to strand truman at sea  these little contrivances  however  do not hold a candle to the overall effect of the work  the audience gets the feeling that it is watching the actual show  and we are drawn to trumans mundane existence for no other reason than it is there  the final result effortlessly combines the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing discomfort that hits you square in the gut  upon leaving the theater  i was looking up in the sky  wondering if it was nothing more than a gigantic dome  just checking  
0	  mandingo  has traditionally been seen as one of two things  either a muchneeded revisionist look at slavery in the south  or in the words of film critic leonard maltin   a trashy potboiler  that  appeals only to the sm crowd   actually  i think  mandingo  is a strange combination of the two  although it fails on both fronts  its too trashy to be good drama  but too dramatic to be good trash  the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell  james mason  and his son  hammond  perry king   one day in new orleans  hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede  heavyweight boxer ken norton   although the movie never explains it  a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley  according to the movie  mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves  hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him  hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves  meanwhile  hammond has married his cousin  blanche  susan george   because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild  hammond  however  is happier spending nights with his  bed wench   the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex  it is quickly apparent that hammond  despite his overt racism  is more in love with his bed wench  a sensitive slave girl named ellen  brenda sykes   than he is with blanche  hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had  pleasured  her before he did  of course  its fine that hes slept with numerous slave girls  but the fact that his wife  a  white lady   had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her  so blanche is usually left lonely and sexstarved while hammond is sleeping with ellen  blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child  hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a halfblack child  although its okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond   so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth  and hammond poisons blanche  hammond then finds mede  shoots him twice in the shoulder  and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water  yes  you read right  the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive  judging only by the plot   mandingo  is pure sexploitation  the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible  with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society  when  mandingo  was released in 1975  it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail  this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs  dramatically   mandingo  is weak and unfocused  and historically its mostly confused  if one were to judge history by this film  it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality  not economics  not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working  except for a few house servants  the men spend most of the time sitting around  while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner  there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves  but  mandingos  overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick  although theres plenty of violence  fights  vicious beatings  shootings  and the aforementioned human boiling sequence  thrown in for good measure   some tried to write off  mandingo  as a blaxploitation film  one of a number of quicklymade  lowbudget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies  but its not that easy    mandingo  was studiofinanced by paramount pictures  and produced by dino de laurentiis  the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as  the bible   1966   the remake of  king kong   1976   and the illfated  dune   1984   the director was richard fleischer  a veteran who was best known for several special effectsladen action movies including  20  000 leagues under the sea   1954  and  fantastic voyage   1966   as well as such superior suspense films as  the narrow margin   1952   the script  based on the supermarket bestseller by ken ostott  and the subsequent play by jack kirkland   was penned by norman wexler  who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on  serpico   james mason  perry king  and susan george were wellknown and respected actors  mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt   and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career  so why is  mandingo  so bad  a number of reasons  including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job  wexlers script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive  it combines stereotyped slavetalk   yessuh  massuh    stereotyped southern white trash talk   fer whutre you gittin outta bed     and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk   if you see me hang  you gonna know you killed a black brother     fleischers direction is clumsy  especially during the fight scenes  and all the actors give weak performances  especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable  nevertheless  credit should be given where credit is due  despite its exploitative nature   mandingo  was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery  until then  there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery  even classics such as  gone with the wind   1939  can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter    mandingo  reassessed the south  and showed that it wasnt all beautiful plantations  green fields  and pretty sunsets  but all this is constantly undermined by the films negligible pointofview  it claims to see things from the black perspective  but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners  with a little more maturity and different handling   mandingo  might have been an effective  worthwhile film  while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery  it never deals with them  the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile  but wexlers script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing  there is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner  but  mandingo  never does it  steven spielberg touched on that same topic in  schindlers list   1993   by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid  the difference between that film and  mandingo  is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair  unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma    mandingo  is satisfied to simply show some skin  and because of that  its  trashy potboiler  nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished  
1	as i write the review for the new hanksryan romantic comedy youve got mail  i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet  i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the worlds biggest paid commercial for america online  and i wonder  is that so bad  well  the commercial part is  as for the movie  well  as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan  i think ill be okay  to paraphrase james berardinelli  whose reviews i admire very much  tom hanks and meg ryan can act  they are both wonderful  but for all of hanks glorious work in serious films  such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan  and his glorious triumph in philadelphia  i like him best when hes suitably obnoxious  tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when hes going to get the girl  the only question is how  meg ryan  americas high school sweetheart  can act  shes had a handful of memorable performances  including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally  i must not mention what she does  due to the  well  um  you get the idea  and if you dont  get the movie fantastic   but  i like her best when shes  well  perky  she is so adorably perkycute that together with hanks  they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime  some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples  but i dont really know  all i know is that i just like them both  they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry thats really hard to resist  and im not going to even try  theyre just really  really cute  sweet  and charming  hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron  who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle  here  the setup is a little different  kathleen kelly  ryan  owns a small childrens bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her  she is successful  beautiful  and dates a wellknown columnist with very radical idea  kinnear   she is also having an affair  of sorts  you see  kathleen  with the handle shopgirl  is secretly emailing ny152  they have a strictly undetailed relationship  there are no specifics  and they have no idea who each other is  ny152 happens to be joe fox  hanks   a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of megabookstores  run by his father  coleman   fox books has decided to open a store on the west side  right across from a little childrens bookseller named  shop around the corner   run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly  every morning  these two email each other silly  and every day  they fight  to the death     its a charming premise  and one that works nicely  balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have  it also has the great sense of being a classic romance  there is no  lets have sex tonight  mantra  if youll excuse my bluntness  this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love  hmm  well  the movie goes through twists and turns  having some sad moments and happy ones  until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan  hook up   to use modern terminology  and kiss their way into happiness  you know its going to happen  the question is now  thankfully  ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey  kinnear  chappelle  and a host of others  including a great scene involving brothers  aunts  and two sweet kids  its all cute and wonderful  and for all of the idealism  it makes me feel good  hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is  he is  i believe  americas greatest actor  does he show it here  nah  but hes still tom hanks  and shes still meg ryan  which is what this movie boils down to  its pure confection  all the bits about the godfather  the jokes  the superb script  its all really sweet  there are some immense flaws  like pacing  the last third of the movie really doesnt work as well as i would have liked  and for a romantic comedy  its slow  once hanks knows the secret  it gets really slow  i even looked at my watch a couple times  to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for  so that i could get home at a reasonable hour  the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated  email  when my kids are my age  i dont know what well be using  but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody  and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history  they just work together  and its nice to see  it gives you  well  a smile  the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious  and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake  i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was  ive always believed that movies are very powerful  very powerful indeed  you see  mankind has three abilities he needs to survive  the ability to think  entertain  and procreate  movies can definitely do the first two  and as for the third  well  id rather not think about that  i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint  and that films that entertained you were good  because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night  and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had  hanks was the driving force behind one of the years best films in saving private ryan  which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world  hes also half of the glue behind the years best example of pure entertainment  tom hanks and meg ryan are magical  as is this movie  its a sweet  lovely affair with a technology twist  it may be a long commercial  but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face  
1	the film  magnolia  can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests  the dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower  they all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart  the numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially  from a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host  each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain  they are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness  whether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse  each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one    magnolia  is a clever  well thought out film from prodigy directorwriter paul thomas anderson of  boogie nights  fame  the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make  magnolia  memorable  however  what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories  the film is never confusing  andersons control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful  he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of  magnolias  scenes drag on too long  any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending  from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesnt get boring  it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot  this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation  every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees  for example  cop john c  reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through halls daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly  the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes  races  and genders suffer  andersons explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing  the only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously  this was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get  the performances in  magnolia  are perfection  this is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting  anderson allows many of hollywoods best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best  character acting  all of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film  worth noting is tom cruise  who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance  he was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past  however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints  the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillons character as phillip baker halls wife  she seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film    magnolia  uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters  anderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours  to see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity  diversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time  i predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future  
1	i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the xfiles  first  let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie  the producers are not stupid  making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable  you have to reach for a larger audience  therefore  the movie is quite userfriendly  altough  nonfans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange  but fear not  duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on  you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera  in any case  the answer is no  i am not a fan of the xfiles  i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium  however  since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movies opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie  i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie  i am glad to report that i learned nothing new  everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others  i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie  warning  major spoilers follow  please do not read to fully enjoy this movie  you must not be able know what is coming  what exactly is over that hill and what that weird  hummm  sound is all about  you have been warned  the xfiles is what a summer should be  exciting  scary  great special effects  unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary  and good performances  this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank  from start to finish  this movie does not let go of you  when i compare it with last summers movies the best way to describe it would be  take the excitement and great score from faceoff and the deadly use of sound from event horizon  this flick is scary  not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes  in fact  the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue  you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd  the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid  you know  when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair  or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt  so yeah  the xfiles is scary  and guess what  you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed  computer generated  babyzilla  it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster  do not think that the xfiles is a monster movie  in fact  the creature is there for maybe three minutes total  no  the xfiles is definately a mulder episode of the series  scully is at his side  of course  but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time  she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny  but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much  no  this is mulders time in the spotlight  by now  you have heard of the scene where mulder  showers  independence day  if you have not then i will not spoil it for you  lets just say that due to recent events mulder should be  showering  godzilla instead  to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there    who cares   if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about  the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous  the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill  the script is spotless  every thing that happens happens for a purpose  if you are confused by something  do not worry because it will all become clear later on but  and i cannot stress this enough  pay attention    unlike most summer movies  the dialogue is twice as important as the effects  miss one vital piece of information and  like most people who talk during movies  you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense  also  to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies    dont  the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation  there is no time to take a breather between scenes because  again unlike most summer movies  godzilla anybody    the xfiles does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots  every scene is crucial and serves a purpose  who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a  big emotional scene  between godzilla attacks  so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies id recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose  but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie  the xfiles is  what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited  cool effects  its got some  pulse pounding  hell yes  strangely enough  i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while nonfans will have a good time  it does not provide answers to the shows many questions  the status quo remains nearly the same and  no  mulder and scully do not get together  rating  four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer  several jump right out of your seat thrills  many  whoah  i never saw that one coming   moments  four  holy shit  where the hell did that come from  and one heck of an ending  you may wonder where this movie lost half a star  well  i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck  the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop  its pretty obvious the films makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time  but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving  
1	in my reviews i try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see  i realize that we all have different tastes and i cannot predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike  but in the case of american beauty  i must make an exception  if you havent yet seen it  go see it  now  stop reading this review and head for your local multiplex  then after youve seen it  come back  ill wait here  welcome back  if you followed my advice  and i see no reason why you should not have  do you    im sure youve just had one of the richest cinematic experiences of your life  american beauty is an extraordinary film  a powerful  jolting exploration of the dark side of the american dream  its humorous but it isnt funny because of the unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs throughout the whole production  mixing comedy and the darkest of drama was the way this film was intended  and by god  it works  making it one of the years very best  lester burnham  kevin spacey  has entered the mother of all midlife crises  he is living life without a purpose  he is bored  depressed and sick of his sheltered  insignificant existence  he barely ever talks to his family  has no sex life  is stuck at a deadend job and thinks he has no reason to live  but one day  when he and his equally troubled wife  annette bening  attend one of his daughters  thora birch  cheerleading performances  he sees something that makes him come alive  what he sees is the performance by his daughters friend  the head cheerleader  he develops a lust for the promiscuous young girl  an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature  but for the first time  lester feels that he is actually living  this crush is only the beginning  lester proceeds to make more and more radical changes in his life  buying the car of his dreams  cursing off the boss and quitting his job   today i quit my job  told the boss to f    himself and blackmailed him for 60  000  would you pass the asparagus please     buying drugs from the voyeurnextdoor  ricky fitts  a teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he considers to be  beauty   and refusing to be docile in family affairs  his new attitude further alienates his daughter  only reassuring her that her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers that be  and inspiring her to enter a relationship with her eccentric neighbor  and the burnhamss neighbors provide american beauty with a significant chunk of its dramatic momentum  ricky fitts  wes bentley  serves as the films thematic center  providing the obscure  powerful meaning of the title  colonel fitts  the father  is one of the most fascinating and complex characters in the movie  even considering his limited screentime  kevin spacey has never been better  and this performance will certainly earn him a chance to put a little gold person on his mantel  he never plays his droll character as a freak  rather  he effectively portrays him as a normal person led to drastic selfexploration by his dissatisfaction with life  spacey is poignant and devastating in the role of a lifetime  equally astonishing is young thora birch  who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling and tenderness  at two hours and ten minutes  american beauty didnt feel nearly long enough  its a complicated  unforgettable film that  like the ice storm two years ago  dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life  powerfully and cynically  it dissects the notion of the pretty house with the white picket fence and appealing garden being the american dream  it claims that this pictureperfect image is just that  an image  and hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it  the dark  deeply ironic ending  though given away by our narrator in the first few minutes of the movie  stays with you for weeks after its all over  american beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs every now and then to counterbalance the mindless drivel we see released  even more so considering its a masterpiece  
0	theres only one presidential election every four years  but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as the thriller of the year  in 1997  weve had absolute power  air force one  shadow conspiracy and murder at 1600  this one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford  trying to bring us a complex plot of coverup and intrigue but copping out over and over again with rehashes of action flick standbys  heres what happens this time  its night at the white house  a secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute butt  the next day shes dead and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in  how do we know hes a hotshot  weve seen the traditional action flick opener  the clever hostage negotiation scene  its not so clever this time  consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal exgovernment employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the street  snipes is off to the white house  where he finds the secret service head  the shiny bald head of daniel benzali  wont cooperate with him at all  in fact  if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda  snipes wouldnt have been allowed in the white house at all  alda helps snipes out further  assigning a sexy secret service agent  diane lane  to act as his liaison    a very dangerous liaison  well  not really  i just wanted to say that  almost immediately  a suspect is found  an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos  snipes doesnt buy it  and launches into an independent investigation of his own  one that reveals planted evidence and romantic involvement by the presidents son  snipes partner  an always wisecracking dennis miller  calls him up every once in awhile with more news and lane  who at first doesnt believe snipes  eventually and predictably comes around  and risks her ass to break into social security storage and break out some classified information  for the first hour or so  murder at 1600 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting  sure  we have to sit through the lame opening sequence and plenty more lame scenes after that  but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon  snipes and lane dont make for a bad action team  but with nothing to work with  theyre just cogs in the bad movie machine  dennis miller might as well not even be in the movie  they waste his talents more in murder at 1600 than they did in bordello of blood  and thats saying a lot  when you get to the last halfhour  the movie has descended metaphorically and literally into a wet sewer  busting out the old breakintothebuilding underground climax  and when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why  youll wish you never sat through this movie at all  the  1600  in the movies title doesnt represent an address  it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide  serving the world for nearly 125th of a century  
0	  snake eyes  is the most aggravating kind of movie  the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing  its not just because this is a brian depalma film  and since hes a great director and one whos films are always greeted with at least some fanfare  and its not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance  this film is hardly worth his talents  its worse than that  its aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more  could be totally intelligent  and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely    then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of halfassedness  or more deservedly  the hall of fame of the eighthassedness  in certain circles   snake eyes  was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawas classic  rashomon   where a crime is told from the four different  and i mean different  perspectives  and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening  which  i might add  is superb  in one very very very long steadicam shot  we meet the protagonist  crooked atlantic city detective  rick santoro  cage   and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife  interupts a payperview event on tv  chases down a gambler  enters the arena all pumped up for the fight  sits down and talks with his bud  kevin dunne  gary sinise  whos character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn  whos also in this   and watches as it happens  theres a big name in the crowd  and thats the secretary of defense  charles kirkland  joel fabiani   whos sitting behind rick  and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion  lincoln tyler  stan shaw   is knocked out  this all happens in the opening shot  and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction  what really happened  this film asks  and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene    and discovers theres a very good possibility it was a conspiracy  as we follow rick trying to learn of more information  we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot  carla gugino   and who flees the scene in a panic  and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casinohotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness takes on what happened  this is all going pretty fine and dandy  and its extremely interesting to watch    then it takes one wrong step  we follow the wrong character  and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on  and way before rick can find it out  but thats not the worst part of it  its that its the one person you didnt think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring  the one you didnt think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it  it only gets worse  the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film  and since we already know what happened  we cant rely on ricks investigation to be all that interesting  its as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in  and decided to just fall back on an easy way out  and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible  events become more and more proposterous  and by the end  the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this  the deux ex machina  thats where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay  this time  its a hurricane  an outofcontrol police car  and a big round ball that adorned the arena  what went wrong  depalma and the screenwriter  david koepp  are extremely credible people in their respective fields  and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this  depalma  who idolizes hitchcock to death  has done many a film like this  such as his masterpiece   blow out   where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece  but granted  depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch  what with his overthetop shot setups  notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel  forgetting anything about boundaries  at least his direction makes up partly for it  then theres koepp  who showed such great ability at making a characters flaws come to life like he did in depalmas earlier  carlitos way   a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well  he can write a flawed character  but his rick santoro seems to be just a halfassed effort  hes flawed  and we can see redemption if the story wasnt so formulaic  a scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup  he may as well have said the opposite of what he says  it would have at least gone with what the character was like  this is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity  because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption  then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way  as i was watching the first half hour  i couldnt wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed  how many different perspectives hed be given  and perhaps hed have to make a choice between whos he has to believe  now theres a film  unfortunately  the film has two major deux ex machinas  one in the disasterous ending  the other  about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap weve seen all too much before  but never from someone like depalma  
1	since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller  blood simple   joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic  original  and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood  their films are highly stylized  deeply embedded in a particular time and place  and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances  in  the big lebowski   their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy awardwinning  fargo   the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war  and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski  aka the dude  the dude is played by jeff bridges  one of hollywoods most underrated actors  in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high  the dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties  he has shaggy  shoulderlength hair  a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim  and he wears mostly stained teeshirts  long shorts  and gellies without socks  he smokes a lot of pot  drinks a lot of white russians  and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies  a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak  john goodman  and donny  steve buscemi   one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation  but never quite makes it in  one day  the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski  david huddleston   this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife  bunny  tara reid   owes a lot of people a lot of money  the main plot and all its accompanying sideplots and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here  suffice to say that the dude becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped and the dude is asked to be a courier for the ransom money  by the time all is said and done  walter has become deeply involved  as has the big lebowskis daughter  maude  julianne moore   a feminist performance artist  a pornographer named jackie treehorn  ben gazzara   and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare  who was so great as the silent but deadly kidnaper in  fargo     the big lebowski  plays like an amalgam of all the coen brothers earlier efforts  it shares their previous films strong sense of time and place  as well as their sendups of movie genres and political and cultural ideologies    lebowski  has the same kind of crazed caricatures that made  raising arizona  such a hoot  it has surrealistic dream sequences  one of which involves a busby berkleylike dance number  that characterized the ending of  barton fink   and it has the same kind of cartoonish look and feel that pervaded  the hudsucker proxy   the film was shot by veteran cinematographer roger deakins  who has worked with the coens on three other films   barton fink    the hudsucker proxy   and  fargo   deakins always gives the coens films a distinctive visual style  and here he does a brilliant job of capturing the bright colors of seedy los angeles in the early nineties  whether that by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by the dudes main competitor jesus quintana  john turturro   or the strikingly manic dream sequences  one of which involves the dizzy spectacle of watching a strike from a bowling balls point of view  if  fargo  was the coen brothers most restrained effort in years   the big lebowski  marks their return to overtheedge filmmaking  it is overflowing with style and attitude  which helps make up for the scattered plot fragments that never quite come together in the end  the coens fill the screen with lighting  set design  music  and hilarious performances from all the leads  especially bridges and the always reliable john goodman  who shows real comic timing in his untimely naminspired outbursts and his intense dedication to his adopted judaism  with joel directing  ethan producing  and both writing  the coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out  their talent lies not in their ability to reflect the norms of reality  but in their potential to dig out the darkest corners of life and bring them to light  the coens rejoice in the oddballs of the world  and they put them centerstage to show that its not just guys like the dude who are nuts  but the entire planet  
0	     because im a scientist  thats what we do    dr  alexander mccabe  bob gunton   in response to why he created evil bats  alright folks  stop me if youve heard this one  genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals  assisted by a specialist in the particular animals field  must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth  oh yeah  the military is on their way to bomb the town as well  so they are running short on time  sound familiar  such is the plot of the destination films release of bats  dina meyer stars as the  bat specialist  sheila  who is pulled from her research  along with her annoying sidekick  played with irritating deftness by leon  in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently  with the help of the local sheriff  lou diamond phillips   a cdc official  carlos jacott   and a scientist  bob gunton   sheila discovers it is indeed bats  who have been genetically altered by guntons character to be more aggressive and omnivorous  in order to be used as a military weapon    i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film  theres not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good  in this respect  the film never disappointed me  this film reaches a level that transcends the  so bad its good  level and borders on the downright insane  the effects are awful  the script is contrived  and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously  i think   i challenge anyone to sit through the scene  where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner  with a straight face  thankfully  the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with  dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in  johnny mnemonic  dragonheart  and starship troopers    the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit   and this one is no exception  while one never really gets the impression that meyers character could be a bat expert in reality  one never really cares to doubt it either  she gives as good a performance as could be expected  plus shes nice to look at for an hour and a half  lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here  as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero  although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for whats going on in town  for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats  the only bad performance in the film is that of leons  he is relegated to the  im not sticking around here   character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays  anyone who cant immediately tell that bob gunton  the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films  is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised  but i highly doubt it  even if he hadnt been the villain in just about every film hes ever been in  so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever  in fact  his death is welcome  because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale  if the plot doesnt sound ridiculous to you yet  then check out these little tidbits  a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol  an entire town disregards the sheriff and doctors orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated  causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force  killing several townsfolk  a government official blows off shelias instructions  to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats cave that will kill all of them off  by pulling a night job  resulting in the death of an entire military unit  a cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it  finally  to top it all off  this little texas town is showing nosferatu in its single screen theater  for reference  our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens  and were lucky to even get kevin smiths dogma   the most laughable part of the movie though comes from the illconceived bat puppets  while the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing  making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend whats going on   the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more lowkey  therefore we the audience get loving closeups of the most unrealistic  rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film  being able to see the puppeteers arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse  after all of this  if you still decide bats might be the movie for you  dont say you havent been warned  trust me when i say that its a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through  i just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in  shes definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these  
0	this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disneys live action george of the jungle  tarzan and the lost city  the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burroughs legendary hero to the big screen  is one of the most inept and illtimed of any tarzan adventure so far  badly conceived and poorly executed  tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves  i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan  its not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie  furthermore  its even more curious that this film is rated pg  which  by definition  rules out any sex or explicit violence  and  while im not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story  tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production  of course  no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city  since the films troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line  imagine george of the jungle stripped of all  intentional  humor  and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like  with its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences  the film barely registers a pulse  anyone in search of a relatively entertaining  family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book  which uses the same basic elements to much better effect  the only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery  which  unfortunately  includes the two lead actors   the film doesnt attempt to retell the origin story  the thinking is that it has been done often enough  instead  tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a  k  a  john clayton a  k  a  tarzan the ape man  casper van dien  several days before his marriage to lady jane porter  jane march   he is living happily in england  enjoying the benefits of being a landowning noble  meanwhile  in central africa  the dastardly nigel ravens  steven waddington   a selfproclaimed scholar and explorer  believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar  which he calls the cradle of civilization  on the way there  he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things  like burning native villages  to earn the wrath of the locals  one shaman  determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal  sends a mystical message to tarzan for help  with lady jane following close behind  he returns to the jungle where he was born  its patently obvious that casper van dien  one of the prettyboy heroes of starship troopers  was not hired on the basis of his acting ability  with his plastic facial expressions  monotone voice  and complete inability to make convincing animal noises  his range rivals that of steven seagal  his pecs  however  are impressive  and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off  jane march  on the other hand  has to keep her shirt on  which may be a first for her  some six years ago  march give a solid performance in jean jacques annauds steamy the lover  since then  she made the careerkilling decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night  which exploited her every acting defiency  tarzan continues this trend  march may be attractive  but  at least judging by this performance  she cant act  meanwhile  steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy  instead  he turns out to be little more than a nuisance  the story line is pure formula  which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies  the problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless  the romantic elements are all contrived  in fact  lady janes presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance  the special effects are truly bottomofthebarrel  including some laughably bad men in ape costumes  apparently  animatronics were too expensive for this production   and  of course  as with all jungle movies  there are the obligatory cute animals  over the years  the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material  the most famous ape man was johnny weismuller  but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part  including gordon scott  who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role   weismuller made 12 tarzan features  van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number  and  having seen tarzan and the lost city  i would argue that the moviegoing public would have been well served if he had missed by 12  
0	a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings  family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years  and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in handwringing detail  still  i cant recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love  and after it  i still cant  bye bye love is rarely funny  more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tvmovie fare  only a few moments which have nothing to do with the films main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion  bye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children  dave  matthew modine   a father of two  is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend  vic  randy quaid  is a foulhumored father of three about to go on a rare date  donny  paul reiser  pines for his exwife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma  eliza dushku   over the course of the weekend  the three men face various crises  including vics blind date from hell  janeane garofolo  and donnys growing estrangement from emma  the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo  and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality  randy quaid is the best of the three  bitter without being irritating  gleefully spiteful without being frightening  his runins with is exwife  lindsey crouse  are a bit overplayed  though  and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist  rob reiner  is gimmicky and implausible  he does get bye bye loves best subplot  a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo  and he does a great slow burn  paul reiser really has only one character  his slightly befuddled  uptight nice guy  mad about you  persona  but he does it well  as a personality  he is appealing  but as a character  he becomes pretty boring here  matthew modine  is  quite simply  terrible  this isnt a performance good enough to be called mailedin  he even forgot to put a stamp on it  modine lacks any charm in an appallingly underwritten role  looks bored most of the time  and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how its all his fathers fault hes such a cad  carolcos executives  whose entire future is resting on modines bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island  must be sweating buckets right now  bye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie  because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids  making it just another  dating in the 90s  movie  when the movie does deal with the children at all  it is to have one of them scream out an accusation andor cry  perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug  perhaps not  even more confusing is a subplot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonalds and befriends a troubled youth  it is a sad end to flanders career  getting caught up in a truly annoying overuse of mcdonalds as a location  a plot device and  apparently  a major advertiser  even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parentchild relationships  it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off  because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family breakups and their effects on children  any way you slice it  it is a bad situation for kids  and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue  it is left to the dads romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is  and it isnt enough  there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood  but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching  bye bye love is a genuine shame  
1	it has happened again  a movie that is well scripted  well acted  and well directed  it is involving  suspenseful    it even has an unexpected twist at the end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus  but in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie  the sixth sense is that movie  starring bruce willis  armageddon  as a child psychologist and haley joel osment  forrest gump  as a troubled youngster  the sixth sense is more spooky than scary  though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle  eightyearold cole sear  osment  sees dead people  not just in dreams  and not just as lifeless bodies  he sees them walking around like regular people  and he sees them all the time  dr  malcolm crowe  willis  is trying to help him  he recognizes in cole many of the same attributes as one of his earlier patients whom crowe failed  resulting in that patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on himself  if crowe could manage to find a way to help cole  he believes he just might be able to put his own demons to rest  but first he needs to gain coles trust  the boy is so frightened by what he sees  he has closed himself off emotionally  being unwilling to tell anyone    not crowe  not even his own mother  toni collette  clockwatchers     about his  secrets   crowe begins to spend more and more time with him  even as his own marriage starts to dissolve around him  his wife anna  olivia williams  rushmore  becoming cold and distant because of his neglect of her and his preoccupation with the boy  bruce willis underplays his role  allowing the excellent script to do most of the work of building character development  crowe moves from treating a troubled boy who wont communicate  to treating a troubled boy who is having hallucinations  to wondering if perhaps there isnt some truth behind what the boy sees  mr  willis does a serviceable job  letting the focus remain on the story instead of on his familiar action hero screen persona  elevenyearold haley joel osment manages to impress us with his performance  he demonstrates an amazing amount of selfcomposure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex character as if he were a seasoned pro  it is fine work for one of such a tender age  keep your eye on this young man  the supporting cast is also quite effective  toni collette  as the confused  frightened  and frustrated mother who cant understand what is happening to her child  olivia williams  as crowes once loving wife who is shutting down emotionally due to the lack of attention from her husband  and donnie wahlberg  ransom  as crowes expatient  now grown  who illustrates his doctors failure to help him in the most vivid terms imaginable  twentyeight year old m  night shyamalan  wide awake  directed his own script  maintaining a proper tension throughout the film and crafting the storytelling so expertly that the films full impact is not reached until its final moments  when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation of all that preceded it  it is a rare movie which manages to pull that off and mr  shyamalan  as the one responsible  is certainly to be commended  in giving the sixth sense a favorable  three star  review for its craftsmanship and artistic merit  i must also point out that  spiritually speaking  the film is highly misleading  there is no scriptural foundation upon which to base a belief in ghosts or the  living dead   the concept of death being a doorway to another plane of existence is a devilish lie that has been around as long as man himself  the first lie recorded in the bible was devised by the serpent who assured eve   thou shall not surely die   a direct contradiction of gods admonition  that same lie has been perpetuated ad infinitum throughout the ages  scriptures do speak of a time when the dead shall rise but that wonderful demonstration of victory over death will not commence until after the second coming of christ    an event which has not yet occurred  therefore  the dead remain in a state of oblivion  having no consciousness  until that longawaited time when the final trump shall sound  and then  youll need six senses to register all the joy and rejoicing that will resound throughout the heavens  
1	after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction  jackie brown seems like something of a lighthearted departure for quentin tarantino  its more of a hohum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language  luckily  his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen  and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer  the story introduces us to a streetwise black woman named jackie brown  pam grier   a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another  she works for a bottomofthebarrel airline and receives a minimal salary  but one day  she is picked up by a pair of federal officials  including michael keaton as the toughnosed ray nicolet   and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope  jackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell  samuel l  jackson   who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation  soon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle 500  000 through to them under nicolets nose  with the help of ordells oaf of a partner  robert de niro  and druggedout lady friend  bridget fonda   also entering the picture is a bailbondsman named max cherry  robert forster   who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated  how i wont say   the big dropoff is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown  in which numerous doublecrosses take place and many clothing store bags  filled with cash  switch hands  its unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there  and doesnt offer anything extremely compelling while doing so  there are  as always  amusing exchanges between characters  the funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda  as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq  or lack thereof  the most interesting relationship is between max and jackie  a 56year old white bail bondsman and a 44year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry  youve got to commend the acting  jackie brown is a seriously draggedout exercise enlivened by such fine acting  the film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours  35 minutes  tarantinos talky style manages to hold your attention heavily  but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline  also  fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear  jackie brown has four major shootings  and two of those take place mostly offscreen  so dont be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath  you can expect frequent foul language  mostly coming way of ordell  who  much to the dismay of spike lee  uses the n word as part of his regular vocabulary  the acting is the glue that holds everything together  grier  making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970s  is more than adequate for the title character  in fact  shes flatout great  another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster  who does a grand job as max cherry  and is perfectly cast in doing so  michael keaton makes his presence felt  albeit in small but dignified moments  and de niro is ideal in playing the lughead who goes over the edge  speaking of that  bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordells bikiniclad beach babe  and yet she manages to look fairly occupied  theres not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie  which is a lifesaver for mr  tarantino  the story barely holds together in the meantime  and we merely get a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake  but oh well  jackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino  even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work  lets just hope that the director hasnt gone soft on us  
1	us critictype people are always shaking our heads and telling everyone that movies arent thrill rides  but i think that  back to the future ii  is one of the few exceptions  if the original film had the spirit of the 1950s  then this has the spirit of the 80s  full of fights  chase scenes  cliff hangers  special effects  some detective work  and of course the vision of the hightech future  the film picks up exactly where the first film left off  with doc  lloyd   marty  fox   and jennifer  elizabeth shue  travelling 30 years into the future  because something bad is going to happen to marty and jennifers kids  doc tells marty he must take his sons place at an incident that will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr  says yes to griff  wilson  in one of four different roles   whoever said history tends to repeat itself wasnt joking  especially when it comes to the movies  essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the 50s takes place again in the year 2015  but its not as authentically exciting this time because it is so obviously a parody of itself  at the end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for the better  and it seems like everythings copasetic right  wrong  since when do things go according to plan in the  back to the future  movies  there are so many minor conflicts and details that effect the plot and the direction of the story i wont even bother to list them all  basically we get to see marty as an old man  his house  his family  etc  we also go back to an alternate 1985  and then back again to 1955  with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch a breath  the films best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back to the first movie and shows a lot of the action that occurred from another angle  its difficult to convey the sense of wild and zany fun without describing every little detail  the only thing sacrificed in this film is the suspense  instead of a grand finale  we get lots of little victories  by the end everything is back to normal  but something happens that leads to yet another sequel  but it doesnt seem gratuitous    back to the future part ii  is a really great adventure movie  it certainly has more originality than other films but it lacks a certain charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor  
0	old soldiers never die  they just turn into cliches soldier a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body  jungian archetypes  these two opposites need each other to create a whole  but its difficult to integrate both  often well encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and  with the help of jungs magician  sit around imagining grand schemes  without the drive to manifest their plans  much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness  all they have are dreams  warriors on the other hand  are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat  and will do combat with every last bit of their energy  they dont care enough about anything to know whats worth fighting for  gladiators who live only for the battle  this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know  but can also illustrate societies  america during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers  todd 3465  kurt russell  is a living  breathing archetype  chosen from birth as a soldier  he is raised by the government to be a killing machine  his childhood is cruelty and competition  he is indoctrinated with the big rules  never question authority  winning is everything  strength beats knowledge  a veteran of numerous intergalactic wars  todd is 40 and hes obsolete  a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger  left for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers  caine 607  jason scott lee   hes unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234  a garbage world  obviously our hero is still alive  he finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health  when the peaceloving colonists get a good look at who todd is  they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world  they are the other good guys  these lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons  todd finds himself in the role of protector  what could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultraright wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon  the effects are mostly secondrate explosions or jerky slow motion  the plot is old hat  we dont get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers  hardly anything makes sense  the films science fares badly  with all the remarkable advances weve made in just 37 years  the film takes place in 2036   were still stupid  after conquering the stars  for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a landfill light years away  even stranger  the garbage barges appear to double as time machines  virtually all the trash is vintage 1960  there is nothing in the story that is not predictable  the first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra  connie nielsen   the woman just a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him  it doesnt take a genius to foresee that her husband isnt going to be around much longer  is it a shock to find out that the films climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine  who would you guess wins  some of the scenes would work if this were a comedy  todds first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connies nipple poking through her thin blouse  later as he sits by his lonely campfire  a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion  supposedly this clich  isnt meant to be humorous  dastardly col  mekum  jason

shane  in outer space  maybe  if shane were played by sylvester stallone in rambo mode  the movie doesnt even work as an action film  there is never a question as to the outcome  somehow the new

is buffedup and does a credible job but its not much of a challenge  uttering around 100 words during the film  mostly what todd does is hit things and stare grimly into space  gary busey as todds commanding officer is completely wasted in his lowkey role  everything blows up and occasionally it looks cool  sometimes the sets are impressive  unfortunately  occasionally  and  sometimes  dont make a film  most disappointing is that the screenplay is by david webb peoples who wrote  blade runner   possibly the best science fiction movie ever made  sharpeyed viewers will notice a few obscure references to that film  peoples says that this is not a  blade runner  sequel  but a  sidequel  that takes place in the same universe  although that may have been the intent in his original script  the result is more like a bad television series that the  blade runner  replicants watch to pass time  perhaps those artificial humans would find this entertaining    michael redman has written this

1	note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  be forewarned  on december 20  1996  amidst all the yearend oscar bait releases from the major studios  miramaxs genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream  although the teen horror market had been given up for allbutdead in recent years  the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns  eventually topping 100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history  while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre  the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry  suddenly  everybody was looking for hip  inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes  the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost  scream director wes craven  previously best known as the creator of new lines a nightmare on elm street film series  was thrust back into the limelight  and screams rookie scribe  kevin williamson  burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion  its hard to understate this last point  mr  williamson has  based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing  scream  i know what you did last summer from october 1997  and now scream 2   enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame  quickly become the most wellknown screenwriter amongst the entertainment weeklyreading  box office figurewatching youth culture since  well  since that quentin tarantino guy  whom  it is said  has also achieved some renown as a director   indeed  in a singularly freakish oddity  it is the screenwriter  mr  williamson  and not the director that has been receiving the lions share of acclaim for the success of scream  and the print advertisements for scream 2s theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence  while the traditional  a film by wes craven  drapes the films title in the ads  right below it  in equal sized font  yet  reads  written by kevin williamson   an affirmation of the screenwriters contribution to the project which may be unprecedented    i can envision the board of wga  licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of  a film by  is attained   and  much like mr  tarantinos screenwriting  mr  williamsons work is vaguely unconventional  incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters  in scream  they satirically discussed other horror films  here in the sequel  the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels  scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood  and mr  williamsons rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel  while the sequel was planned from the outset  a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr  williamson sold the screenplay for scream  the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived  and its only at about the films midway point when it becomes engaging  like its predecessor  scream 2 opens with a splashy  eyegrabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the films principal narrative  this time around  were following the exploits of a young couple  jada pinkett and omar epps  attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab  a running filmwithinafilm gag where the  true life  events behind the first film has been turned into a movie   however  although it tries hard and has some good ideas  the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with  and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overlynoisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes  the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore  where her performance not only convinced me that she  could  act  but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that ive ever seen   there are too many knowing  hip popculture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence  and the setup isnt nearly as cleverly frightening as screams  while the first films preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying  the payoff here is almost campily theatrical  flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college  where returning characters sidney  neve campbell  and randy  jamie kennedy  have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film  the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors  singleminded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers  courteney cox  roars into town to cover the breaking story  while everawkward former deputy dewey riley  david arquette  flies in to protectively guard over sidney  theyre joined by cotton weary  liev schreiber   who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film  his role here is significantly expanded  the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory  although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isnt necessary  not because so many people have seen the first installment  but because this is  after all  a sequel to a slasher film  what do you  think  happened to these characters in the prior movie  theres a lot of new faces on the scene too  sidneys new boyfriend  derek  jerry oconnell  and her new roommate hallie  elise neal   randys fellow film student mickey  timothy olyphant   gales newlyassigned nervous cameraman joel  duane martin   omnipresent local journalist debbie salt  laurie metcalf   coed cici cooper  ms  buffy herself  sarah michelle gellar   and a pair of simpering sorority sisters  rebecca gayheart and sirens portia di rossi   any of these characters could be the killer  or for that matter  could be the next victim  as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay  the narrative is once again framed around the increasinglyflimsy premise of a whodunit  one problem that scream didnt have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer  here  and to some extent in i know what you did last summer   mr  williamsons screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery  the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements    it doesnt help matters any that the killers alterego is fairly obvious from the getgo   indeed  the finale plays as fullout camp when the villain is finally unmasked  frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes  this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations  scheming  and motivation  that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it  while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived  the aspect where its headandshoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences  theyre staged much more imaginatively here  save for the first postprologue murder  which is handled in such a mediocre  conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized   and are much more fun to watch  its hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck  and a catandmouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged  although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown  in terms of its characters  the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey  who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music   their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour  an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is wellwritten  and theres a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed  on the other hand  sidney is pretty dull here  she doesnt have any compelling presence  and theres nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that shes the returning heroine  given this  and the fact that theres no strong second banana character for sidney  elise neals role isnt nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowans shoes   its no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film  what surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast  the films mounting body count bears out the fact that  no  character is safe  well   almost    while in principal i applaud this bold policy  at some point youve got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel    i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular  whose casting for the next installment of the series wouldve seemed obvious   but hey  as rose mcgowans character said in the first film   no  please dont kill me  mr  ghostface  i want to be in the sequel   look what that got her

1	the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate  people are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future  after a sort of confusing bit involving fakelooking cyborg things  the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds  the basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while  make that every 1000 years or so  an evil force comes to destroy earth  the things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element  the plot in this movie really isnt that important to the thing though  this movie has very good special effects  for the most part  the technoish music in the background fits the mood very well  bruce willis is an illegal taxicab driver in a futuristic new york city  one day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk  this movie is about what happens  the plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations  also there is a fair bit of action in the film  particularly towards the end  some characters are just plain strange including a highlyenergetic deejay in drag  bruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does  the movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down  it is one of those scifi films where youll be saying  cool  followed by a  what the hell       i give the fifth element  
1	okay  let me first say  this is a beavis and butthead movie  if you do not like beavis and butthead  do not go to see this movie      however  if you do like them  i recommened you get out right now and go see it  the movie starts off with the boys wondering what happened to their tv  they notice that it has been stolen and they vow to find it  this wind their way through america searching for dallas  she is a woman   they look for her because as they are searching for the tv  they find a drunk who wants them  to do  his wife  well  of course they think he wants them to score with her when actually he wants them to kill her  and the fun starts their  this movie is a mix of funny gags that anly beavis and butthead could pull off  it is quality entertainment that only fan of beavis and butthead would enjoy  i enjoyed this movie alot because mike judge knew how to keep pace  even when they were crawling through the desert and i thought the movie started to lag  he manages to keep the laughs coming  if you expecting changes from the show keep looking  the same character  the same voices  the same everything from the show and thats what makes it good  you might think with a movie from a tv show  you can change a few things  often times this spells disaster for films because the film makers veer away from what made the show popular in the first place

1	james jones  one of the major novelists from the middle of the twentieth century  has written a number of fictional works about the effects of war on the individual  a veteran of world war ii  and a witness to the pearl harbor bombings  his novels are not only grounded in realism but poetic in nature  they are reminiscent of stephen crane in their blunt eloquence  a trait which lends itself to razorsharp focus  but perhaps none matches the scope of his autobiographical novel  the thin red line  now a cinematic masterpiece from director terrence malick  the books principal cast  some thirty characters  has been trimmed down for this rendition  but it still retains its most endearing value  each of the roles has an everyman quality  emphasizing jones examination of world war ii on the american soldier  theres a definitive chain of command present  and this also plays on the motivations of the cast  but most importantly  and perhaps intrinsic to the novel but not to the movie  a dynamic and effective voiceover is used  malick has several characters relating their thoughts  giving the viewer a greater perspective of the issues at stake  the issues at stake are many and one  told from a limited thirdperson perspective  as opposed to a topdown  omniscient view   the movie entails the struggle of an american infantry company   cforcharlie   to take a hill during the conflict at guadalcanal  the south pacific island is seen by the top brass as the key position for american armed forces to hold if they want to win the war  and want to win the war they do  in an excellent performance  nick nolte plays cforcharlies commanding officer  lt  col  gordon tall  hes an aging soldier who embodies the winatallcosts mentality  if only to impress his superior  john travolta  in a questionable cameo   this philosophy is opposite that of captain bugger staros  elias koteas   who dearly values the life of each and every one of the men under his command  at the front are the privates and corporals  adrien brody  james caviezel  ben chaplin  et al   lead by 1st sgt  welsh  sean penn   who must actually execute the suicide orders handed down to them  the thin red line is filled with intense  visual poetry  but its nearly three hours long  although the interest level is high throughout the first two hours  the climax comes fortyfive minutes before the end of the movie  it goes without saying that the movie drags on the back end  the thin red line will doubtless be compared to 1998s other masterpiece of war  saving private ryan a countless number of times  but to do so is to belittle both films  for although similarities abound  so do differences  director malick has a story to tell  and for those interested in listening  this can be a very outstanding movie  
1	roman emperor marcus aurelius  richard harris  chooses his trusted general maximus  russell crowe  as his successor  however the emperors evil son commodus  joaquin phoenix  murders his father before the announcement can be made  and maximus  as well as his family  is sentenced to be executed  maximus is able to escape his executioners  but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo  oliver reed   proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money  he being a former gladiator himself   and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator  when emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum  proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle  maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus  gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania  and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required  40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence  style of moviemaking  the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used    its choppy slowmotion which is unsettling and distracting  its similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan  but nowhere near as effective  the actual gladiator battles are thrilling  but also a bit disjointed  many times its unclear as to exactly whats going on    all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled  were not sure whos blood or by whos hand though  theres an instance of this earlier in the film too thats disappointing  its comes when maximus escapes his executioners  some flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free    but i still dont know exactly how he did it  russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995s virtuosity  for whatever reason his stardom never arrived    but he should have it now  from here on moviegoers should now be able to say   lets go see the new russell crowe movie   he gets the best scene in the film  and one of the best moments of all recent movies  when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum  its both rousing and chilling  joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character  which could have easily happened   commodus is conniving  sneaky and whiny  but phoenix never lets the character get silly  its a very good  and very creepy  performance  oliver reed died during the filming of gladiator  and its a huge loss to the acting world  ive always been fascinated with reed    hes one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years  its ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again  as he gives a fun and sincere performance  the film is dedicated to him  and he will surely be missed  reeds death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem  as he still had scenes to be completed  rather than recast the role  and end up reshooting a great deal of footage   a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars  ironically  that was probably more money than reed ever earned for a single film  anyway  this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of  for about twenty seconds  and if you arent looking for it you wont even be able to tell  some of the other digital effects are less convincing however    and like i always say  noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately  its sad that such a good film has these distractions  movies like the fall of the roman empire and spartacus seemed to do okay without the use of computer effects  keep in mind that gladiator is based on real people and real events  but is entirely a work of fiction  however its a work of fiction thats great entertainment  and another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in 2000 a  d  
1	mpaa  not rated  though i feel it would likely be pg  for martialarts violence   with three movies already  re  released theatrically in america  and at least three more on their way  jackie chan is one of the newest  hot properties  in action adventure stardom  and its just about time  for over twentyfive years  jackies been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong  thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy    drunken master  has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to  make it big  this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong  im not entirely sure why  exactly  in many ways   drunken master  is similar to most of jackies other early films  such as  fearless hyena  i and ii   master with cracked fingers    half a loaf of kung fu    spiritual kung fu   and others  in fact  looking at all these early films together  one gets the impression that they were stamped out  cookiecutter style  at a rate of four to six per year  all using the same casts and telling very similar stories  to be honest  i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste  theyre quite different from action movies as we know them in america  these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past  with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together    drunken master   though its plot is tighter than some  is no exception    as an aside   drunken master  was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw  and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen    in a movie theater in seattle  as part of an asian film festival  at the time  i didnt really think it was anything special    but after having seen more films like it  its kind of grown on me     drunken master  s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies  such as  fearless hyena  i and ii and  master with cracked fingers  slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harshseeming master  and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end  a formula that has been  adapted   to put it kindly  by american films such as karate kid   more specifically  jackie chan plays the part of wong feihong  aka  naughty panther   a funloving  practicaljoking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good  but not quite good enough  after embarrassing his instructors assistant by beating him roundly  then beating up a bully in a marketplace  wong feihong tries to hit on a pretty girl  but discovers that she  and her mother  can hit back  better than he can    and is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt  respectively  his father  wong keiying  is unhappy about this  and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages  keiying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment  which feihong does not like at all  while escaping from this punishment  feihong meets up with a drunken old man  who proceeds to thrash him soundly  then take him on as a student and thrash him some more  this turns out to be su huachi  a legendary master of drunkenstyle kung fu  he assigns feihong a series of bizarre tasks  such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame  cracking walnuts with his hands  and other such exercises  that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up  then  when hes ready  he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu  unfortunately  the lazy feihong only practices six of them      drunken master  features some wonderful martial arts sequences  with jackie winning some fights and losing others  its been said before  but ill say it againthese fights dont just happen  theyre as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance  and it shows  in his fights  jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment benches  jugs  cups  bowls  fruits and vegetablesoften in new and surprising ways  the fight scenes  particularly those toward the end of the film  are unparallelled in most american films  whether jackie wins or loses  its really something to see    and its often as funny as anything  too  and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very  very good at  theres very little thats new in this moviejackie winning fights  jackie getting beaten badly by a master  jackie going through punishment or training    these schticks have all been seen before  in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties  but theyre still hilarious as ever  likewise  jackie has a great supporting cast  many of whom were also in other early jackie films  and theyre often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own  the really big thing about  drunken master   though  that inspired several copycats  including a couple starring jackie himself  and a sequel fifteen years later  was the drunkenstyle kung fu  im not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu  but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security    and it apparently helps if youre drunk while youre doing it  genuine or not  i have to admit  theres just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize whats going on  come to think of it  perhaps this element is what accounts for this films success over any of the other jackie films    its not just martial arts  its the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go   whoa     on the negative side  the cinematography in this film is nothing special  the film stock is rather primitive  the plot is often rather slow  and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background    gone with the wind   this isnt  still  if you like martial arts films  or like what youve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more  give it a shot  its much more  real  than chuck norris or jeanclaude van damme  you might very well like it  another interesting thing about  drunken master  has to do with its video availability in the us    drunken master  is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original  letterboxed  hong kong subtitled form  commercially available on vhs  from magnum video  in a gold box  for about 10   there are plenty of other early jackie films around  but these are typically either in dubbed  panandscanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase  thankfully   drunken master   at least  is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen  at a very affordable price  if you like  drunken master   take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there  even the dubbed ones arent really too bad    if nothing else  you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue   i particularly recommend  spiritual kung fu    half a loaf of kung fu   the  fearless hyena  movies  and  snake  crane arts of shaolin   also  the mostlyunrelatedstorywise sequel   drunken master ii   will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year  though what its americanrelease title will be is still uncertain  and comes highly recommended by this reviewer  also  for a rather different interpretation of the character wong feihong  who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore   ive been told to suggest the  once upon a time in china  series starring jet li  though i havent personally seen any of them yet   if you choose to watch  drunken master   i really hope you enjoy it  and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema thats out there  all in all  i give this film an  
1	not since 1996s shine  which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott  has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of worldclass musicians  in fact  if one were to watch these films together  it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills  yet hilary and jackie  the sophomore effort from director anand tucker  has something more to say  it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale  emily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale  playing the sisters du pr   both musicians from childhood  hilary  griffiths  is renowned flutist while jacqueline  watson  is easily as skilled on the cello  the two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women  both together and seperate  their careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one anothers  and although their lives take very different paths  hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour  they are bound together by their deep family love  the performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance  they contrast each other wonderfully  and while watsons portrayal of jackie du pr  is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic  both characters are charged with emotion  the frank cottrell boyce script  which is based on the book by hilary and piers du pr   brings a great deal of depth to these characters as well  the script is also to be commended for its wellpolished dual nature  cottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller  which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert townes script for mission  impossible  and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame  the latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least  and the rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story  some will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised  nevertheless  hilary and jackie is a movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid fundamentals and is a decent watch all around  
1	steven spielbergs second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film  spielberg  ever the student on film  has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest  and most powerful entries  he also managed to cast this eras greatest answer to jimmy stewart  tom hanks  who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle  for about 160 out of its 170 minutes   saving private ryan  is flawless  literally  the plot is simple enough  after the epic dday invasion  whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular   capt  john miller  hanks  and his team are forced to search for a pvt  james ryan  damon   whose brothers have all died in battle  once they find him  they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home  accompanying miller are his crew  played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational  barry pepper  adam goldberg  vin diesel  giovanni ribisi  davies  and burns are the team sent to find one man  and bring him home  the battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary  literally  there is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the films first 20 minutes  spielberg films almost the entire movie without music  leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion  and they do to perfection  the sequences in france  all of them  beginning with the battle and ending with the battle  are fabulous  especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides  trying to save private ryan  there are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences  this is what coppola was looking for in  apocalypse now   but couldnt create  the sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war  the performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary  he is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world  with his comic timing  dramatic flair  his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears  hanks is this countrys finest actor  and he proves it here  however  spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece  with a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time  spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film  the sequence involving army chiefofstafff george marshall and mrs  ryan is decent  but doesnt hold up to the rest of the film  relying on wartime cliches to power it  but that is forgivable  what isnt is the bookends of the film  the cemetary sequences  the first one is quite good  a decent introduction into the lives of these men  the last sequence is atrocious  the forced emotion  accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music  is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film  these flaws are what downgrade  ryan  from the greatest film of our era  to the greatest war film of our era  spielberg should have trusted his own material  and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie  to end his masterpiece right there  the use of the flag  though patriotic  is in contrast to the movies theme  the power of the bulk of the film  however  is astonishing  spielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art  that persists even after first viewing of the film  is extraordinary  this is the film of the year  
0	the sequel to the fugitive  1993   u  s marshals is an average thriller using its association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks  tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard  the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive  this time  hes after fugitive mark sheridan  snipes  who the police think killed two fbi agents  but of course hes been set up  and when the police plane escort he  and gerard  are riding crashes  he makes a run for it  gerard not so hot on his tail  what follows is about 2 hours of action  brought to us by the director of executive decision  1995   another film curiously involving a plane  when comparing this movie to the fugitive  the prequel is far superior  but even on its own  u  s marshals is a pretty lousy movie  while the original was reasonably intelligent  and had a fugitive to root for  the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive  mainly because we know so little about him until way into the films overlong running time  while the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character  u  s marshals is straight in there  pulling its trump card  the place crash  almost immediately  to be honest  i couldnt care less if snipes character got captured or not  snipes performance is average  and his character gets surprisingly little screen time  considering he is the fugitive  for reasons ill explain later  tommy lee jones is as fine as ever  although his role is hardly a challenge  the sense of deja vu was overwhelming  i know its the same role from the fugitive  but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film  theres a few nudge nudge references from the first film  but apart from that  nothing  nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie  downey jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce whos roped into the chase  and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife  nobody looks as if their having a good time  and all the performers are on autopilot  the supporting cast are o  k  but when it comes to performances  u  s marshals falls flat on its face  it doesnt fare any better plotwise  either  the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes  but then veers off into terrorists territory  as said above  the film is an normal  average terrorist thriller  seen a million times before  but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional  if this film wasnt the sequel to the fugitive  this would probably go straight to video  or not even been made at all  because its so average  and because of the films plot changing its course  snipes is almost forgotten apart  and hardly features in the movie  stuart baird  the director  is all right  but theres no particular scene that stands out  its director is the usual action movie style  even the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension  the special effects are nice  especially the plane crash  and theres a good  if very loud  soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith  but in the end  u  s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement  sure  its loud and dumb  but in the end u  s marshals just aint fun  bored performers and a lackluster plot and script  do not make a good action movie  overall rating review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities 
0	when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain  you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie  however  since this film also featured michael madsen  more than capable character actor  this time in the role of protagonist  the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt  however  the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials  madsen plays richard montana  tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio  played by lynch   however  the raid was only partially successful  and montana is getting the rap  so  he begins his own private war against gio  trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt  in the process  he meets gios mistress gina zamora  played by rosie vela  and starts relationship with her too  although it doesnt stink like many of the similar films can  inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine  nobody in this film actually puts much effort  including madsen or lynch  and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke  the only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela  who  apart from showing her more than impressive looks  shows some of the singing talent too  however  this isnt reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would  in most likelihood  forget the next day  
0	there is a rule when it comes to movies  a sequel is never as good as the original  there are very few exceptions to this rule  and texas chainsaw massacre  the next generation is not one of them  now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie  and that this isnt even the first sequel to it  you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience  dont be fooled by the presence of up and coming talents matthew mcconaughey  a time to kill  and renee zellweger  jerry maguire   they made this movie before they were stars  judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons  its a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey  apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was  because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger  apparently the two young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day  and i dont blame them  they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them  unfortunately for them it is a horror film in which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character  while mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mechanical brace on his leg that he controls with a television remote control    hey  dont say i didnt warn you   to make matters worse  leatherface  the chainsaw wielding maniac  who was never the scariest of psychopathic killers at the best of times  has now become a full blown crossdresser  and spends the entire movie in drag  there is a plot to this movie but it isnt worth mentioning  lets just suffice to say that a group of teenagers are in the typical wrong place at the wrong time and are left to the mercy of remote control man  mcconaughey  and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving halfwitted sidekick  man  i cant get over just how bad this movie is  this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities  even the obligatory topless babe shot wasnt enough to hold my interest for more than 2 seconds  the writing is bad  the direction is even worse  but both of those things look good in comparison to the acting  this is the sort of movie that they should make people in prison watch  a guarantee you  if criminals thought that they would be subjected to this film they would never break the law again  
0	  the beach  is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder  every forty minutes of this twohour film begins with a new theme  virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act  it starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment  but then in the second act  the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of  blue lagoon   forty minutes later  the mood changes once more  and it becomes a dumbed down version of  lord of the flies  where an isolated community is discovered  where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs  by the time its over  you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about  the main character of  the beach  is angstridden richard  leonardo dicaprio   he travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if youre looking for a good time  richards voiceover tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown  this seedy environment is just what richard is looking for  he checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy  robert carlisle   he seems like a raving lunatic  obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis  though his jagged behavior would distress most of us  richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen  moreover  the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life  captivated by the idea  he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey  they are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise  who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richards  once they finally arrive at this paradise  however  the mood of the story shifts to richards growing desire for francoise  this particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard  etienne is about as exciting as fluffy  white sand  its odd that etienne never sees this coming  but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view  and once the three stumble across the hidden community  mood shift imminent   more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers  for example  there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards  and the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark  there are several ideas that are introduced in  the beach  and each one could merit its own featurelength film  theres the man vs  nature angle  the love triangle angle  and the utopiagoneawry angle  but the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred  dicaprio  as a result  has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through  consequently  the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up  
0	when i was nine  i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store  masters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures  they combined science fiction and fantasy  had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read  of course  the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history  given the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon  not to mention its moderately successful spinoff shera  princess of power   it was inevitable that a production company would put two and two together  come with the result of  trillions  and make a liveaction masters movie  lets be blunt  masters of the universe is a very bad movie  the story is painfully dull and mindnumbingly cliched  hands up who  wouldnt  guess heman and skeletor take their fight into the real world  and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors  dolph lundgren as heman for one  or good actors  james tolkan  meg foster  given such awful characters and dialogue that they cant help but seem terrible  it is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars  we have the alien bounty hunters  the desert skif technology  stormtrooper lookalikes and a musical score so reminiscent of john williams that  deja vu  is too polite a term to use in describing it    blatant uninspired ripoff  would appear more appropriate  tv fans might want to check out courtney cox  monica in friends  and robert duncan mcneill  lt paris in star trek  voyager   very early in their careers and not doing to well in them either  so in the face of such mindless submediocrity  is there anything to make masters of the universe worth watching at all  yes  there is  one incredible good reason  his name is frank langella  langella has always been one of the underrated actors of hollywood  appearing in countless films over the years  here he plays skeletor  the villain of the piece  dressed in opulent black velvet robes and bearing a skull for a face  he is one part darth vader  one part emperor and two parts grim reaper  given this character  langella falls right into it with style and precision  skeletor is believable  interesting and manages to tread the fine line between being a homage to the past and startlingly original in his own right  masters of the universe  i remember loving it when i was eleven  at twenty one its difficult to see why  but  as i said  it is blessed with a superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of the remainder  besides  this year marks the films 10th anniversary  watch it with some friends for a good laugh and celebrate  
1	upon arriving at the theater during the opening credits  i took my seat and prepared myself for what appeared to be  hellraiser meets the crow   but as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking the narrative monologue  describing  the strangers  and their reasons for contacting human beings  i was hooked  there was something especially compelling about the nature of his voice  i knew from the start that i was going to witness the actions of his character rather than the actor attempting the character  sutherland played the role as a true veteran  upon the completion of his monologue  the camera arrives on sutherland in such a fashion that you can only wonder how long alex proyas spent on cinematography  i would imagine  for a film of this caliber  that maximum hours of work were spent where they were needed the most  the film flowed beautifully  as i was being taken through the intricate regions of the  dark city   a clever plot began to unravel  to the point where the last time i had seen such clever plot twists were in  the usual suspects   not to mention a series of special effects that would make james cameron literally turn green with envy  but if youre not exactly the biggest scifi fan  caveat emptor  get ready for the atmostpheric darkness of  12 monkeys  or  the crow  without the boredom or depression  the concept of the plot is as mindstretching as  12 monkeys  was  however  so be prepared and be sophisticated  and imagine a picture that finally does justice to the comicbookgonefeaturefilm fad that hollywood has recently become abusive of  dark city simply puts  spawn  to shame  in fact  during the climax of the film i couldnt help but feel the strong presence of an  akira  esque explosion throughout the general feeling of the movie  so my initial predictions were wrong  this film is anything but the meloncholy of  hellraiser  parts one through five  im never one to base a film entirly on special effects  so know that when i give dark city its actually because the film contained all of the neccessary ingredients to keep me entertained and awake from storyline to plot twists to camerawork to even  tsk  tsk  special effects  not since contact have i recieved such deep insight into the way the human mind operates and never this year have i been so blown away  the best film ive seen all year  and easily one of the best ive ever seen 
1	the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber  the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse  and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest  little caper adventure entitled where the money is   the elderly bank robber is henry  paul newman   a famous criminal that was only recently caught  he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune  always the shrewd thinker  he begins working on a plan to get out of jail  this involves years of studying buddhism and selfhypnosis  when he is prepared to execute his plan  he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke  now a seemingly twitching vegetable  he is temporarily transferred to a staterun home  carol  linda fiorentino  is the nurse that cares for him  shes a very bright person with a good heart  yet  her life is a miserable waste of time  the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars  her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics  worse  shes in a deadend relationship with highschool sweetheart wayne  dylan mcdermott   they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom  to her  this made sense long ago  but now  its a different story  wayne seems equally bored with his life  but is content enough to stay put  waynes greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman  carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients  but shes never been anywhere else and doesnt see many other opportunities in life  however  when henry falls under her care  her outlook begins to change  the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke  carol  however  begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all  maybe she can get through to him  and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away  the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry  back to life   and what are some of carols resuscitation techniques  perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses  if that fails  maybe shell try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20foot high pier into the cold lake below  when he finally comes out of his state of selftrance  the movies direction changes  though it remains equally if not more entertaining  carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and selfassuredness  she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy  this  of course  puts wayne in an odd situation  henry and carols bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car  henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash  meanwhile  this is carols ticket to a better life  wayne is uncomfortable with the situation  but helps out nonetheless  however  his lack of commitment threatens their success  the heist sequence is suspenseful  well paced  and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong  where the money is does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist  newman is the real joy of the film  adroitly showing that at age 75  hes still really hot stuff  he possesses a sly smile  displays a dominating attitude  and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive  fiorentino is also a fun presence  you root for her despite her sense of amorality  sure  she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchairstricken man into a lake  but we can see that to escape her deadend world  she needs to do something drastic  with two charismatic characters such as these  its hard to ignore that where the money is is where the fun is  
0	movies dont come much more ridiculously titled than  i still know what you did last summer   but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous  the title sort of works as a warning  more than a sillysounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor  this horror sequels moniker also contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot  what  you  did last summer  you  actually did the summer before last summer  and since  i  knew about it this summer as well as last summer  its really illogical to say that  i  still know what  you  did last summer  the filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter  i still know   the longer  i still know what you did two summers ago  or the appropriate  stupid people getting hacked to bits   that last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart  for example  if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago  would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet  even if it was just to locate and borrow a cute little dress  probably not  but thats precisely what college student karla  pop diva brandy  does to best friend julie  jennifer love hewitt   resulting in the first in a long line of phony frights  julie  youll recall  was one of the sole survivors at the end of 1997s surprise hit  i know what you did last summer   after a slasher with a grudge to bear  its a long story  began trying to pick off her  her buddies and various others in their coastal carolina village  in this installment  the plot picks up as karla wins a trip to the bahamas  and julie  yet racked by guilt  decides that maybe a tropical getaway will help ease her mind  yeah  right  their island paradise has room  of course  for one more in the form of the stillalive killer  muse watson  from the first film  he sports the same gortons fisherman getup  a heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity  but why hes still trying to stay anonymous is a mystery this movie never solves    though i suppose his hookhand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of a leisure suit  in a sense  thats the movies glaring flaw  everybody knows who the bad guy is  thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel  the murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary  but trey callaways derivative  i still know  screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims  when julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed  giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all  what does he do  he twistties the lid shut and cranks up the uv rays  youd think hed want her gutted now instead of a skin cancer victim later  even prequel  summer  lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and a few neato shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh  the innovative gallows humor that scribe  and  scream  wunderkind  kevin williamson injected into  i know  s unfolding story is sorely missed  replaced with the grating antics of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed and tosses off slang like  yo   youll cheer  not shriek  when he ends up with a pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest  if  i know what you did last summer   however effective  was just the kind of movie that those subversive  scream  flicks poked fun at  then the deadly  i still know what you did last summer  deserves a fullblown roasting on  mystery science theatre 3000   
0	i dont appreciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking the plot is interesting  when in fact its ludicrous  in the case of the generals daughter  the plot is more than capable of intriguing you to a certain point  but at this juncture in the story  the movie begins to fall apart like a crumbling cookie  this predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving  and that is unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of its detailed flaws  get past one moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent  and youre likely to survive this entire movie  travolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner  whos working undercover at a military base when another situation arises  the apparent rape and murder of a young female officer  leslie stefanson   it turns out that the victim is the daughter of general joe campbell  james cromwell   let the investigation begin  with the assistance of fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill  played rather onthesidelines by madeleine stowe   brenner uncovers what appears to be an intricate and bizarre homicide case  things begin to get marginally engrossing when we meet colonel moore  james woods   a former commanding officer of the deceased who has a few secrets up his sleeve  woods submits another scenestealing performance here as he oozes authority  surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar  with echoes of his supporting role in true crime  in which he duked it out with clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges  he makes every moment believable  here though  the intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with travolta  as the two send mindful  knowing glares across the room  there are many scenes such as this in the generals daughter  in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure  but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to absorb  director simon west  con air   shows a watchful eye of delivering a stylish looking thriller  but he fails miserably when it comes to the intellectual part of it  the generals daughter is  more often than not  a predictable and unexciting mess  it does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless  dragging its heels all the way at a mindnumbing snails pace  a few brief action scenes  marvelously handled in the editing department  show that the movie could have delivered such a more proficient package  from a director who does such a great job of staging explosions and miraculous stunts  i suggest west should stick with mindless  riproaring action features and attempt to avoid future projects like this  still  the movie is certainly not without its merits  the acting is very good from the majority of the experienced cast  the performances range from commanding  travolta  to electric  woods  to stiffasaboard  cromwell  who doesnt show off his real talents here   madeleine stowe manages to hold her own for a while  but as the female lead in an actionthriller  she doesnt pull through sufficiently  one of the problems with the execution is that its very predictable  from minute one  i had few doubts about the identity of the killer in question  the script even unwillingly points him out for us  using familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the end  in all fairness  weve seen many of the devices used in the generals daughter put to greater effect in other films  the secrets behind the girls mysterious death are explained gradually  but by the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it feels unnecessary and surprisingly silly  the generals daughter is not a terrible movie  and it is involving enough to sustain a viewers attention span for a certain period of time  but it just could have been so much better  
1	it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst3k  tm  he had never seen any episodes of the show  and i have watched a scant few  due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes  for those of you not familiar with the premise  dr clayton forrester  beaulieu  wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public  to achieve this  he  in the words of the tv series theme  which is missing in the movie   bumped mike nelson  nelson   on the noggin and then shot him into space   and is monitoring nelsons reactions to the movies he is forced to endure  rather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies  nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions  tom servo and crow t  robot  the format of the show consists of nelson  servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched  and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love  the ship on which our heroes are marooned  only two things are different in the movie  the absence of forresters sidekick  tvs frank  and the slower pace of the jokes  this latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke  for their big screen outing  the producers have chosen  this island earth   a 1954 classic  and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill  unfortunately for that film  but making it ideal mst3k fodder   acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which  by todays standards  are less than impressive  nelson  co  make jokes about everything from japans dominance in the world market  to star trek  to the state of disrepair of seattles kingdome  and most of them work  unfortunately  the segments set outside the satellites movie theater seem out of place and arent particularly funny  but at least theyre fairly short  the big question about this movie though is  why  i presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series  rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago   but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen  there are no special effects to dazzle you  no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat  and no use of digital surround sound  so  it seems pointless to spend 8 per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for 3  and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts  nevertheless  mst3k  tm provides more laughoutloud opportunities than any film youre going to see this year  and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse  given its uniqueness  i hesitate to grade it against other films  but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of  unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad bmovies  it does well  
0	im going to start this review off with a hypothetical question  lets say youve just been in a car accident  and the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious  your friends have left to go get help  and youre waiting to see if the victim wakes up  a towtruck comes along  and the driver hops out of the truck to see whats going on  he then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck  do you  a  run away screaming for your life  staying away from the main road  b  run away  but not too fast  and stay on the main road even when the madman in the truck starts following you   stop  to catch your breath  try to negotiate with the psycho  and when that fails  start running away again  all the while  staying on the main road   if you answered  a   you are far more intelligent than the screenwriter of  texas chainsaw massacre  the next generation  and will likely hate this movie  however  if you answered  b   prepare to enjoy a film made with idiots like you in mind    texas chainsaw massacre  the next generation  is being called a sequel  but its really more of a remake of the original  theres a few changes here and there  but its essentially the same  even the infamous  meathook  scene has been recreated   the story opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom  and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere  needless to say  they soon encounter leatherface and his nutty family  much carnage ensues  to call this movie inept would be putting it mildly  in addition to the laughably idiotic situation i mentioned in my hypothetical question  there is a moment towards the end of the film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere  it just swoops down and kills him with its wheel  no explantion is given as to who was flying it or why heshe is going around killing people with the planes wheel  the dialogue is even more atrocious  zellwegger  who is kidnapped by  the family  early on  keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people  when youre surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws and dead corpses  i would think that rationality would go out the window  speaking of going out the window  there is a scene in which zellwegger jumps out a window  apparently  the stunt double had a little trouble  because she visibly gets stuck in the window  the director quickly cuts to a wide shot where the stunt double  doesnt  get caught in the window  this was one of many glaring inconsistencies  there are so many  in fact  that if i were to name them all  this review would be several pages long  the only reason i am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey  he plays a member of  the family  with a hydraulic leg  homemade  i might add  and is so completely overthetop  you cant help but be amazed by his performance  he obviously had a lot of fun with this part  and it really shows  he makes jack nicholsons portrayal of the psychotic inn keeper in  the shining  look restrained in comparison  for a horror movie   texas chainsaw massacre  the next generation  contains surprisingly little gore  in fact  in contains none  theres a little blood here and there  but thats as far as it goes  which leads me to believe that the budget must have been  astonishingly  low  and it shows  everything about the movie looks cheap  from the sets to the costumes  especially leatherface  once frightening and nightmare inducing  hes now as terrifying as dame edna  do yourself a favor and take a pass at this remake  check out the far superior original instead  
1	a fully loaded entertainment review  website coming in july  i didnt really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family  the movie bombed at the box office  and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based  my real concern  though  was the general reputation of snlrelated movies translating to the big screen with lessthanstellar results  halfbaked  anyone   i was surprised to discover a truly entertaining  often hilarious yet also touching little film  it is an al franken production throughandthrough  who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture  for those of you who dont know  al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley  who has a really annoying show on a publicaccess station about increasing your selfesteem  etc  although not a licensed therapist  stuart smalley is  as the program proudly boasts   a graduate of several 12step programs   stuart is doing well enough with his tv show  but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles  stuarts relatives are a mess  his dad and brother  harris yulin and vincent donofrio  respectively  are alcoholics  his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce  and his mom is in constant selfdenial and solves all perceived problems by baking  then  disaster strikes  stuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked  he is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself  and there the comedy truly picks up  franken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes  but as sharplydrawn  real people  although smalleys dad has always imbibed too much  stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy  also  after an accident towards the end of the movie  both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought  although filled with small  very funny scenes  stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments  especially towards the conclusion  for a lightweight comedy  it handles these scenes especially well  often better than many socalled  serious dramas  of today  all the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a onejoke bit  if you feel like renting a comedy  and you havent seen this film  i definitely recommend you try this one out  youll laugh    youll cry     its all there

1	clint eastwood  in his ripe old age  is cashing one talent in for another  midnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwooddirected film clint isnt even in  and its damn good  adapted from a bestselling john berendt novel based on true events  this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah  where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head  and thats just the mayor  as director and producer  eastwood contributes a self indulgent but very competent 150 minutes  neatly balancing drama  suspense and humor  like all great movies  midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves  and not from some contrived  juvenile intrusion  the acting  from bigtime stars john cusack and kevin spacey  is as good as youd expect  but its the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm  cusack plays a freelance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town  country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spaceys parties  lots of food  beverages and gunplay  yes  an employee of spaceys has a huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead  it seems like a simple matter of self defense  the guy threatened spacey  shot at him  missed  then spacey took him out  but being a movie  theres much more to it than that  and cusack decides to stay in town and write a book about the murder  a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in  the weird circle of entertainment  this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in  theres the requisite sexy woman  alison  nepotists daughter  eastwood   the strange piano player  the voodoo woman and the transvestite  miss chablis deserves a paragraph of hisher own  as the stealer of every scene she appears in  what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony  chablis  playing herself  is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul  but never seems exploited as the movies comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie  there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes  which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie  but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating  certainly the characterizations of the judge and spaceys lawyer both help immensely  as does having the flyguy as the jurys foreman  its here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spaceys homosexuality  yes  spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man  before he shot him  of course  midnight in the garden of good and evil isnt a classic  but it is one of the better celebritydirected  truestory bestseller adaptations out there  likewise  no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations  but the performances are all great  in fact  id almost recommend that the academy add a best supporting transvestite category  serving america for more than 125th of a century  
1	carolco pictures and dutch director paul verhoeven  robocop  came together to create the 1990 mega hit that is total recall  the film is a masterpiece of sets  action  and special effects  action and science fiction just dont get any better than this  the story involves a construction worker named douglas quaid  arnold schwarzenegger  who lives on earth with his beautiful wife lori  sharon stone   quaid is obsessed with mars and decides to go with the second best choice  a brain implant  fake memory  of a two week vacation on mars  while being implanted a memory cap is triggered and the doctors realize that quaids memory has previously been erased  now the people who did it are after him  quaid must find out who he really is and why these people want him dead  the plot unfolds at a rapid pace explaining itself through great action  special effects  and twist after mindboggling twist  it grabs you and never lets go  this film is a winner from beginning to end  the plot is superb  combining the best elements of science fiction and psychological mystery to create a riproaring saga  schwarzenegger gives his best performance ever  and the supporting cast is good too  the action and stunts are terrific  the sets are huge and elaborate with a lot of attention payed to detail  the music and sound effects are perfect for the film and really add a certain level of impact to the action  the makeup effects by rob bottin  the howling  the thing  and robocop  are top notch  not to mention extremely outlandish  the visual effects by dream quest  the abyss  and industrial light and magic  star wars trilogy  jurassic park  and terminator 2  are phenomenal  the visuals had such a state of the art  slickness  that they won an oscar  of course the film isnt always realistic  its more fiction than science  for example  it is true that a body wont explode in the vacuum of space but in total recall they do  who cares  its a movie  movies are supposed to entertain  and in my opinion this film achieves an entertainment level in film that is so terrific  it may be impossible to beat  
1	natural born killers is really a very simple story that  in essence  has already been told in bonnie  clyde with some major variations in emphasis  mood and degree  both films glamorize  outlaws   in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers  both relate the story of a couple liberated by love  but where bonnie  clyde was partial and subtle  natural born killers is total and blatant  where bonnie  clyde was social  natural born killers is psychological  what bonnie  clyde hinted at  natural born killers confronts and explores  what bonnie and clyde stole  mickey and mallory kill  to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them  expressed metaphorically as killing  subdues the mysterious power this film wields  for the most part  when mickey and mallory kill  they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily  they kill what is trying to kill them  they kill what dissembles and cowers from life  they kill what needs to be killed  this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity  brahma created  vishnu preserved  and siva destroyed  but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma  the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate  im forced to say it for claritys sake  a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes  that is  destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics  your plumber  bonnie and clyde  mickey and mallory  and siva are all productive destroyers  i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death  presently and historically  than any other phenomena  muslims kill christians  hindus kill muslims  christians kill pagans  jews kill christians  etc  you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged  religion is an orgy of killing  the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasnt been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable    the state is the divine idea upon earth   hegel said  meaning it is absolute  allpowerful  ineffable  unassailable  infallible  authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh  allah  god  etc  well  what does all this have to do with natural born killers  let me first say that religions of this nature  in the ideal  take the place of sex  consider the catholic church  which in its heydey  took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever  god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope  cardinals  bishops  monks  etc  they forego the one  in order to come closer to the other  during the middle ages  when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged  the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power    parenthetically  witness plato as well  in the republic  he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime  not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself  regularly assailing the passions   catholicism  as policy  attacks the passions as evil  it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure  masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution  this is religion  this is authoritarianism in its essence  as further evidence  the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters  our culture  most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years  we cant help but adopt  even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes  leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self  mickey and mallory knox internalized them  too  then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other  discovered them  and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves  it is a straightforward liberation through sex  as some good patriarch once observed   you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on   mm had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions  they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions    the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers   as mickey says  as a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter  let us look each other in the face  we are hyberboreanswe know well enough how remote our place is    neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans   even pindar  in his day  knew that much about us  beyond the north  beyond ice  beyond deathour life  our happiness     we have discovered that happiness  we know the way  we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth  who else has found it  the man of today    i dont know either the way out or the way in  i am whatever doesnt know either the way out or the way in  so sighs the man of today     this is the sort of modernity that made us illwe sickened in lazy peace  cowardly compromise  the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay  this tolerance and largeur of the heart that  forgives  everything because it  understands  everything is a sirocco to us  rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such southwinds  as far as i can tell  this is what the movie has to say  its alleged critique of the media is only secondary  tertiary  quaternary  subsidiary for sure  for example wayne gayles first report ends with some gen x dude saying   if i were a mass murderer id be mickey and mallory   in his most excellent bill and ted voice  on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical  impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes  it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what mm were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself hed be just like them  killing and destroying what deserves it  let me exemplify what ive been saying by analyzing a scene from the film  namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant  kills him  and then castigates him for giving her  the worst fuckin head ive ever had in my life     now  i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship  because demonstrably they didnt  and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this  sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations  but unwilling to kill each other  since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation  they must kill in place of their lever  its no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey  as the attendant approached he took on mickeys character in the eyes of mallory  she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory  upon discovery  mallory views this as a betrayal  judges him  and commutes his sentence on someone else  the style of the movie is a whole nother matter that i wont get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power  let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness  barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle  the rapid succession of all those 8mm  16mm  35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish  frenetic mood  also  jungian archetypes abound  these cant help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames  some of the best scenes and lines that come to mind   quotes are paraphrased only   mickey to mallory   one of these days im gonna be cummin for you   in prison  while mallory jacks mickey off  semen is a symbol for great potential and things to come  at the time they havent yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet  the two of course go hand in hand  for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs  mickey during his marriage to mallory   as creator of my universe  i pronounce us man and wife   the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting  but telling  too  it reveals mm are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones  this is what mickey means by  creator of my universe   he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes  it is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears  scagnettis first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendants mouth  the indian sage releasing mallorys father  who was reincarnated as a snake   old man  go be a snake   after telling his  snake story  that ends with  bitch  you knew i was a snake   after mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare  mallory says   you killed life     this is another telling quote because it implies they didnt see themselves as killers of life  then what were they killing up to that time  in some case just those zombies faking their way through life  the living dead  as it were  in other cases  all the antilife forces  the cops and their parents  the butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison  it of course symbolizes rebirth  dr  emil reingold  as portrayed by steven wright  passing judgement on mm   mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong  they just dont give a damn   this is reminiscent of nietzsches whole philosophy  and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil  mickey   the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers   mickey  again in his interview    me and you  we are not the same species   notice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control  mickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang  the wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader  no matter who it is  mickey  how ya feelin  wayne  fucking great  mickey  you got the feelin  wayne  im alive  im alive for the first fuckin time  what an incredible transformation this is  he got the feeling and he couldnt contain himself  what a feeling  that feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe  mickey when almost caught in a dead end   think  think  think  think   go figure it out  dwight  tommy lee jones  in general  because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole film  his whole attitude can be summed up with   destroy them     
1	up until about a year ago  john travoltas career consisted of those  look whos talking  movies  notice how they never called them look whos talented  and the 1991 bomb shout  which was bad enough to make most people scream   but somewhere along the line  travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again  weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again  while barry  robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straighttothecutoutbin album aptly named  size isnt everything   and of course  they learned that sales are everything   but now travoltas back on the hollywood scene once again  and i think we all know why  four words  contract with the devil  and this has nothing to do with newt gingrichs  contract with america   no  satan is much more humane  anyway  yes  travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld  how do i know  i own the document in question  amazing what you can buy at those collectors shops for a few hundred dollars  isnt it  get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction  with travolta as crime minion chili palmer  he goes to collect some of the mafias money from a bgrade director  gene hackman  and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game  sure  a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood  but i guess thats beside the point  palmer is determined to get hackmans next project made  so he sets out to convince big star martin weir  danny devito  to star in the movie  bringing along downandout horror actress karen flores  rene russo   who has already had affairs with hackman and devito  it doesnt take a las vegas oddsmaker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well  after the customary sexual tension and denial  which has been used in every comedy from  whos the boss   to speechless  it works in this case  unlike  whos the boss   although its interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also  complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackmans other films and want in on this one too  along with travoltas mob boss trying to track him down for defecting  get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction  despite the obvious similarities  this movie doesnt have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies ive seen this year  yes  even better than halloween vi   get shorty is my kind of movie  one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence  im definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on  are you getting this  shorty  
1	i guess its a credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour 2 could not be ruined even by the nauseating  comedy  of chris tucker  im a fan of jackie chan in just about any medium  and this movie lets him not only do his impressiveasever martial arts schtick  but show off his comic timing as well  it would have worked better if he was the only name above the title  the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects  this time around  the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan  john lone   who makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into the united states  im still not sure how you can make a fortune doing that  is there a place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones    the only way to tell the phony money from the genuine article is to set it on fire and see what color it burns  of course  its up to hong kong detective lee  chan  and trashtalking lapd detective james carter  tucker  to take the bad guys out and the authorities  to the extent that they even exist  stay out of their way  rush hour 2 turns the tables on the first film in that here its carter who gets the two of them into trouble and lee who winds up having to get them out  i guarantee that my rating would have been at least a half of a grade higher had anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan  he refuses to shut up  not only did his voice feel like a jackhammer on my head  but his jokes just arent funny  a pathetic mixture of subpar eddie murphy fasttalking blather and wannabe chris rock whitemanblackman jokes that wind up being more offensive than funny  i realize that in a movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates  but didnt anyone realize how irritating tuckers incessant ranting and raving was  if this is all the comedian has to offer then i dont care to see any more of his films  fortunately  chan makes for a marvelous straight man  and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely  its not often that one actor can so completely save a movie  but there is no other name for what he does  whenever hes on screen  rush hour 2 comes to nearly breathtaking  often hilarious  life  much of it hinges on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch chan try to be a  player   but who cares  i can think of few high concepts that are funnier  the movie ends with outtakes that  as usual  show that chan isnt perfect  and that it does  indeed  take him a few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to look seamless  chris tucker botches some lines as well  and his mistakes are funnier than anything he says in the whole movie  a lot of people have pointed out rush hour 2 isnt very different from its predecessor in tone or style  but i liked the original  and i like the sequel  though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it  director brett ratner  the family man  keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes  i guess sometimes the shotgun approach works   its not great jackie chan  but its jackie chan  and thats enough  up next  jay and silent bob strike back 
1	ok  i admit i had a bad attitude about this film from the start  a romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents  with a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure  yuck  but its not really too bad  it has a lot working against it  for me at least  in addition to the above  it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it is really just a glorified madefortv movie  but longer and with bigger stars  and you have to pay to see it  it does win you over  though  even if it is painfully predictable  just think about it  two single parents  with their cute kids  are thrown together due to a missed field trip  through a day of near disasters  they cont inually meet  get in one anothers way  cause trouble for one another  and generally insult one another at every opportunity  in fact  they hate each other so much that we know that they are  or soon will be  in love  the only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples  so this film is predictable  just as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable  and the screwball genre is obviously hoffmans model for this film   will they get fired from their yuppie jobs  will they make the big soccer game that is so important to their kids  will pfeiffer realize what a jerk her exhusband  a drummer for bruce springsteen  really is  arent they all    will they finally kiss  well  what do you expect  but there is a certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations fulfilled  especially when it is done with as much humour  along with a lack of sticky sentimentality  as it is in this film  pfeiffer and clooney have a certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming  and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal the show  one word of caution  though  this film is being billed in some places as a  family  movie  dont let that stop you  however  i think most kids  especially boys  would be pretty bored by this move  after all  nobody gets killed and there are no explosions  all in all  a good  nonoffensive date movie  the flying inkpot rating system   wait for the tv2 broadcast     a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha      pretty good  bring a friend       amazing  potent stuff        perfection  see it twice  
1	this is a good year if you want plenty of scifi on your multiplex  from the comedies mars attacks and men in black  to luc bessons powerful the fifth element  and to this  scifihorror that is event horizon    more is on the way with contact and alien  ressurection being released later this year   the story is thus  in 2040 an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive  a device that enables a craft to travel anywhere in the universe  instantaneously  this is achieved by creating a gateway  infact  a black hole  between the craft and its required destination  in this case  from near neptune to proxima prime  however  when the event horizon attempts this  it dissappears  without trace  leaving two searches for it fruitless  seven years later  it reappears  transmitting a distress signal and this is where the film starts  a search and rescue ship is sent out to investigate  the team is led by laurence fishburne  and joining them is sam neill who plays the scientist that invented the gravity drive  as the team search the event horizon  they find no trace of the crew but plenty of blood lying around  not a good sign    to make matters worse  as they search the ship  they find themselves being subjected to a series of illusions based on their own individual inner secrets and worse  some very bloody events start to occur as they slowly piece together the events that transpired on the ship seven years ago  it soon becomes apparent that  wherever the ship went  it bought something back with it  something very  very evil    the first thing youll notice in this film is its incredible visual effects  they really are eye popping  with some great models to boot  the acting is quite good  with some occasional witty moments  sam neill does a good job as the scientist that increasingly becomes more and more disturbed as the search continues  but a tip of the hat goes to laurence fishburne who leads the team  in a cool  calm  take no nonense manner  it is his acting skills that help hold this film together  the idea behind event horizon is certainly a good one  it starts off incredibly well  but the middle section becomes quite confused and sometimes muddled  leaving the viewer unsure on just what the reasons are behind some of the bloody and bizarre events that occur  however  the closing 20 minutes of the film more than make up for this  producing one the most nail biting  or in my case  straw of my drink biting   climaxes ive recently witnessed  overall  event horizon is a smart film indeed  its very enjoyable and has some amazing visuals  but be warned  the horror scenes  despite being very brief are very  very  gory  not for the squemish  
0	a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature  beams itself onto a russian science vessel  well  this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable scifi thriller  anyhow  this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the  virus known as man  the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated  and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it  no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies  the movie is that predictable  the story is full of very shallow characters that dont do much other than subsist  the captain of the tug  played by donald sutherland  makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age  looks to be in his 60s   to add to this were shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields  and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks  some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific  in a typhoon no less  none of the characters seem to work together at all  they are always bickering and vying for some form of control  this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story  a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable  all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects  the waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves  it looks genuinely fake  granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish  also on the topic of flaws  the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly  why  if this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics  should it not be able to create them move faster  regardless  the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it  as to the actual casting for the movie  finally there is nothing to complain about  the actors were superb  but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles  having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe  watching these actors act this story out made it bearable  if barely  the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening  so if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre scifi thriller then you wont be too disappointed  as the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens  it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect  this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv  
1	in roger michells romantic comedy notting hill  william thacker  hugh grant  leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends its name to the films title  one day  american movie superstar anna scott  julia roberts  walks in to purchase a book on turkey  quickly enamored of each other  the two embark upon an onagain  offagain love affair replete with romance  humor  and the occasional lump in the throat  the film opens with a nonverbal cue to annas stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actresss appearances in films and at premieres  coming out of limousines  walking the red carpets and such  without words  this sequence gives us a background to her character  following  however  is a setup narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives  i dont know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldnt have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film  and which never resurfaces after the movies beginning  but there it is  if there were ever a clear case for  less is more   this would be it  the film is told nearly first person from williams point of view  as he is in every scene  by nature of this arrangement  we get a very definite sense of what he is all about  and his nice guy personality wins us over easily  in fact  much of notting hills strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis  a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that hes even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honeysoaked apricots from his refrigerator  or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image  william assures her he wouldnt say a word  then adds   well  ill probably tell myself now and then  but id never believe it   great stuff  the downside to spending so much time with william is that we dont get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible  were constantly exposed to williams thoughts  feelings  actions and desires  but dont actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him  there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest  but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that were not sure what shes been thinking all the times in between  this  combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two  makes this hugh grants film hands down  he gets the great scenes  look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna   the great lines  and gives an overall wonderful performance  julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actresss top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film  ala sandra bullock in a time to kill  along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her characters unpredictable behavior  anna doesnt get a lot of our compassion  this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance  much of it supplied by grant himself  but with considerable help from the supporting cast  most notable is rhys ifans as spike  williams eccentric roommate  who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh  hugh bonneville  emma chambers  james dreyfus  and gina mckee bring up the guard as williams friends and family  particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sisters birthday dinner  and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst  its a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation  roger michells use of visuals doesnt sweep us off our feet  but does give us more than your typical movie of this type  for example  there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass  whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying  eight months later   michell presents us with more interesting cues  such as williams walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him  another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air  were generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so  but in this case  the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a birds eye view of the ground below  music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the films scenes  and some of this might have been better toned down  but in other areas it works to full effect  its kind of a mixed bag  but still fares better than many of todays lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video  at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate  notting hills grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the alltime greatest film pairings  but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it  for a couple of hours  you should expect to laugh more than cry  and thats not so bad  now is it

1	titanic is so close to being the perfect movie its upsetting that it isnt  the film  which cost 200 million to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it sunk  pun intended  is a labour of love for cameron  who wrote and directed the film  we all know that big budget dosent mean great film  see waterworld  1995   but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic  but sadly  titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece  although it is one of camerons best films  the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic  they find a safe  and inside a picture of a woman  the woman in the picture  an old winslet  tells the explorers that the picture is of her  the explorers invite her over  and she then tells her story of titanic  in the flashback  dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson  who  after winning a poker game  wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic  leaving liverpool to go to america  also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater  winslet  who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosent love at all  cal hockley  zane  so her family can remain rich  she nearly commits suicide on the ship  but jack comes to the rescue  saves rose  they fall in love  and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them  oh yeah  and the ship sinks  and that is the main problem with the film  and which stops it from being a work of genius  the story and script  both by cameron  are both weak  the story is full of cliched characters   the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry  the poor boy with heart  the stuckup mother  and poor dialogue  the script consists of lots of injokes of how the boat wont sink  and most of the dialogue is pretty basic  its a shame really  as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film  without good dialogue  a film could become a very long  very boring film  like camerons own terminator 2  1992  but  luckily  there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear  firstly  theres camerons direction  there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic  and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic  but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end  there is a lot of mayhem and panic  all done very well by cameron  its a scary sight  watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below  thanks to camerons direction  then  the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes  to support the directing are the excellent cast  working very well with their underwritten characters  dicaprio is good  although he only looks 1617 years old  his performance of a over excitiable  yet also well mannered boy is excellent  and he also has some funny lines  winslet is great also  and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth  zane is deliciously evil as cal  saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash  the audience really does come to hate him  he may be playing the same character he plays in every film hes in  like dead calm  1988  but he does it really  really well  also worthy of note is kathy bates  edward scissorhands  1990  as a loud mouthed american  finally  the icing on the great things cake are the special effects  cameron is a whiz with effects  just watch aliens  1988   terminator 2 and true lies  1994  and they are used very well throughout  the sweeps of the ships are awesome  although digital domain  who did the effects  cannot animate human movement too well  the humans seem to move to smoothly  theres just something odd about them  you can tell that they have been animated on a computer  of course  the ship sinking scenes are awesome  with bodies flying all over the place  and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed  titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film  titanic  then  is a wonder of directing  acting and cgi  but not writing and story  again  like most of camerons films  the editing is loose  cameron edits himself   and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts  titanic  then  although not the godfather of movies it could of been  is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius  enjoyable  scary  and even sad  titanic is a film cinema was invented for  filling the screen with incredible images  and assaulting the ears with awesome sound  a superb film  but sadly not perfect  overall rating  
0	capsule  silly and inane adaptation of gibsons short story  which is nowhere in sight  gibsons script only adds insult to injury  johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie  i say  awesomely  because its one thing to fail  but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged  keanur reeves  who is terrible  stars as johnny  an  information courier  who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head  he is given  one last job   whenever you are in a movie and you hear those words  run   which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal  one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories  but its only followed up on in a token fashion  for his trouble  johnny gets chased by the yakuza  who seem to be the new bad guys in all the hightech thrillers  whats funny is that if you watch gangster movies made  in  japan  there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics  but of course theres no room in this movie for any of that  the yakuza are simply used to point guns  wave swords  flaunt tattoos  and grimace menacingly    i could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies  bound by honor  sugar hill and american me come to mind  when asians remain perpetually stereotyped  but thats another essay   anyway  johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark  why newark  maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york  thats why  there  he meets an assortment of odd characters  icet  dolph lundgren and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos   the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture  it turns out  what else   that the data in johnnys head could save a lot of people  but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesnt kill him  handled right  this could have been absorbing  but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity  the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other  better movies  blade runner and brazil come to mind  everything looks rundown and scummy  everyone dresses like theyre punk rockers  and videophones are commonplace  snore  the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future  complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves   but i kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively untechnical fellow would  think  it would look and behave like  a hacker of johnnys caliber would be blasting away with one commandline function after another  instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms  but of course thats not cinematic  whatever  what went wrong with this movie  gibson wrote his own screenplay  which i guess is part of the problem  what works as a short story doesnt work in a movie  his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot doesnt advance  it convulses  from the script on out  it was probably all downhill  renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless  theres no fun in kicking a wounded dog  is there  
0	one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself  such was the case with boxing helena  1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch  daughter of the great david lynch  made in the dying years of posttwin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs  it was hyped as another   warped  twisted masterpiece  of lynch clan  kim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract  but  the result was extremely disappointing film  which quickly sank into welldeserved oblivion  the movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh  played by julian sands   talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena  sherilyn fenn   beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair  cavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to reestablish the relationship  during one of such occasions  helena is hit by a car  and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her  after she wakes up  helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaughs stylish residence  but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping  she is still trying to escape  so cavanaugh takes off her arms  apart from casting sherilyn fenn  audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart  and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies  this film by ms  lynch hasnt got anything in common with the works of directors more talented father  despite rather bizarre subject  the style of this film is conventional and setting is light  characters are beautiful  but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray  jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic  its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos  the actors arent good either  julian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man  this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains  being neurotic doesnt suit him  bill paxton was better for this role  but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helenas boyfriend  sherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks  but even the her greater effort in acting couldnt help this film  the screenplay  on the other hand  is awful  at least for someone who had made bestseller with laura palmers diary  the events in this movie are implausible  characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion  one of those subplots involves character of cavanaughs  regular  girlfriend  played by betsy clarke  the twist at the end  although unpredictable  is unbelievable and the viewers  who had the stomach to endure entire film  would feel cheated  all in all  boxing helena is disorganised quasiartistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basingers career  
1	moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the postsalary cap era  youve got to know how to allocate your resources  every dollar spent on a freeagent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers  in the nfl  this leads to teams like the detroit lions  who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract  but can only field five guys named herb to block for him  in the movies  you end up with films like  spawn   with a huge specialeffects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors  jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking  he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line  watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid  fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars  is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit  except that sanders doesnt have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages  but like the lions star  jackie doesnt have anybody to block for him  almost every cent thats invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts  and as chan does his own stunts  the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills  this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors  chan directs   scripts and dubbing and supporting characters  not to mention the hideous title sequence  this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain    chans first release in this country   rumble in the bronx   was supposedly set in new york  but was filmed in vancouver  and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible   heck  jackie doesnt even have enough money for a haircut  looks like  much less a personal hairstylist  in condor  chan plays the same character hes always played  himself  a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen  a master of both kungfu and slapstickfu  jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert  and is chased by a horde of neonazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs  one of the things i like about jackie chan movies  no political correctness   he is joined by three women  who have little to do except scream   jackie  save us    and misuse firearms  the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere  and hes more pathetic than evil  en route  we have an extended motorcycle chase scene  a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neonazis  and two confrontations with savage natives  once at the secret desert base  there is a long chopsocky sequence  followed by the films centerpiece  a windtunnel fight thats even better than the one in faceoff  this is where the money was spent  on wellchoreographed kungfu sequences  on giant kevlar hamster balls  on smashedup crates of bananas  and on scorpions  ignore the gaping holes in the plot  how  exactly  if the villains legs were broken  did he escape from the secret nazi base  and why didnt he take the key with him    dont worry about the production values  or what  exactly  the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara  just go see the movie  operation condor has pretentions of being a  raiders of the lost ark  knockoff  but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him  with a lawrence kazdan screenplay  a john williams score  spielberg directing and george lucas producing  condor might be an a movie  however  youve got to go with what youve got  and what youve got in jackie chan is something special  a talent that mainstream hollywood should  could  and ought to utilize  
1	the only historical figure that has been written about more than william shakespeare is jesus christ  which explains why the bards materials are such a popular source for remakes  revisions  rewrites  inspiration  subtlety  credit  and dispute  indeed  in recent years  american contemporary cinema has been swamped with a wash of shakespearean products  including this years upcoming a midsummer nights dream  shakespeares material has been the cause for twentysix big screen productions since 1990  but for a change of pace  mrs  brown director john madden gives us a story of the bard himself in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare in love  marc norman and tom stoppards story is largely fantasy  although as the viewer soon learns  shakespeare in love is not a movie that takes itself seriously    will shakespeare of the 1590s wouldve been married to anne hathaway  and he wouldve had a teenage daughter and two young sons  here he is a bachelor played by joseph fiennes   will is a writer struggling to come up with a great play  and his current comedy in the works   romeo and ethel  the pirates daughter   just doesnt quite seem right  with the help of the great writer christopher marlowe  rupert everett   and the inspiration of true love with noblewoman viola de lesseps  gwyneth paltrow   he changes things around and writes one of his greatest tragedies   romeo and juliet   the love story between will and viola loosely parallels the story of romeo and juliet  to great effect  fiennes and paltrow develop a sexy chemistry as the two lovers which gives the movie much momentum  this momentum smoothes out the bumps in the unfinished and largely unsuccessful comedy  the supporting roles are well filled out  from geoffrey rush as wills worrisome agent  philip  to tom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman  even ben affleck  leading the troupe of actors  manages to make a favorable impression  and judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i  gwyneth paltrow is by far  however  the standout of the lot  creating a large percentage of the forementioned vibrance  the story is wellcrafted if nothing else  although it has dangerous moments where it flirts with the  lets make a movie  genre  the dialogue is breezy and lighthearted  and certainly accessible by the audiences lowest common denominator  theres something for everyone in this romantic comedy  making it prime date flick material  although certainly not inspiring in any regard  it revels in a wholesome  wellrounded atmosphere that has been absent in many of 1998s pictures  the truelove story is one of the best around  certainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent yearsopen releases is just around the corner

0	my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love  i love ralph fiennes  i love uma thurman  i love sean connery  hell  im even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw  i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago  and ive been eagerly awaiting the film ever since  a few months into the summer  however  i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times  and that it had ended up in the midaugust dumping ground  then  in this final week before its official release  i learned that it was not to be screened for critics  and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs  and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique  my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things  the film i saw today didnt even meet those expectations  this is a lousy  incoherent mess  i would slam it harder  if it werent for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine  lovable actors  but sets are ultimately empty  and the performances are completely uninspired  thats the main problem with the avengers  for all its hiphop flash and tidal waves  none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired  its like a chore  a bland exercise in superhero film making  it also feels like its been cut to pieces  clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots  this is just plain depressing  the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show  frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that ive never watched an episode  i wasnt alive then  i dont even watch television now  im very sorry that i dont have this perspective  but  judging from the reviews ive already read  knowing the tv show just makes matters worse  i didnt know and love john steed and emma peel  and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles  i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film  based on what the film told me  i gather that steed  fiennes  is some kind of british super guy  somewhat like james bond   and that dr  peel  thurman  is just a really smart doctor  who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits  they are to work together  under mothers orders  mother is played by jolly jim broadbent  while his coconspirator  father  is played by the equallytalented fiona shaw   it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather  his name is de wynter  connery   he is a crazy scottish guy  our heroes had better stop him  or else      the weather will keep getting colder until they  have to go to hell to warm up   one of the films few funny lines   along the way there is subplot after subplot  hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere  feel perfunctory  and ultimately make no sense  for example  our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos  now  killer bugs dont really go with the weathercontrolling theme of the film  the purpose of the bugs  other than to annihilate our heroes  is never established  theyre never even directly connected to de wynter  theyre controlled by his crazy henchman  played by eddie izzard   the special effects arent bad  but theyre loud  obnoxious  and intrusive  like so many scenes in the film  it seems present only to keep your attention from waning  and i guarantee you  it will wane  i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didnt do any good to think  the avengers has clearly been chopped up and reassembled so many times that even the people involved couldnt tell us what happens  there are several scenes in the preview that didnt make the final cut  in addition  many of the sequences have irritating  grainy film quality  which makes it feel lowbudget  the last scene is particularly bad   the scenes that dont feature action should be electric  thanks to our wonderful cast  they arent  the action scenes should be electric  because this is an action film  they arent  either  and what about this wasted cast  oh  it makes me weep with disappointment  were talking ralph fiennes here  one of the best actors working today  one of the best actors  ever   i love the guy  ive loved all his films  until this one  he seems like he wants to understand the film  but hes as lost as we are  and thurman  in all of her spectacular beauty and talent  cant manage to look at home here    i dont blame her completely  for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way  and it cant be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting   connery  however  seems the most out of it  totally lacking any kind of focus  or interest  for that matter  who is to blame  is it the screenwriter  don macpherson  perhaps  although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right  is it the actors  for gods sake  no  these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling  i blame director jeremiah chechik  who shouldnt have been given the task to begin with  his best film  benny  joon  is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be  but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor  add to that a lack of experience in bigbudget action  and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory  if the avengers has a saving grace  its the set design  the sets  by stuart craig  are big  colorful  and often pleasing to look at  i like the final setpiece  on de wynters island  even if none of it makes a bit of sense  i admired the overhead view of the stairs  showing dr  peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere  i also enjoyed michael kamens music score  particularly in the opening credits  but this stuff is routine  good sets and music are nice  but theres a lot more that needs to be here  inspiration  for instance  would have been really nice  maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story  or a sense of purpose  most of all  though  i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles  damn this movie for not giving them the chance

0	by the time dennis quaid  the ostensible star of switchback  makes his first appearance at about the 22minute mark  you may find yourself wondering why he bothered  after all  writerdirector jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines  the first finds amarillo  texas sheriff buck olmstead  r  lee ermey  facing a hotlycontested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction  as olmstead begins his investigation  we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects  lane dixon  jared leto  is an enigmatic young hitchhiker  bob goodall  danny glover  is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination  all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place  the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work  and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the others protagonist  but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse  lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years  hes not supposed to be tracking him any more  according to the bureau  theyve got their man  but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise  two months earlier  lacrosses own son was kidnapped by the killer  and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere  lacrosse knows his killers work  and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game  it wouldnt be fair to reduce everything thats wrong with switchback to quaids presence  but its a pretty good place to start  theres a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center  as a dramatic actor  dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation  we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tightjawed  sourpuss pucker  we can tell hes grim because every word comes out in an eastwoodesque rasp  a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character  pulling the audience into his haunted intensity  making switchback his film  quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated  its tough to become emotionally invested in a characters turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes  even without quaid  it doesnt appear that switchback would have stayed on course  the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy  building our curiosity over which man  the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor  is the real threat  unfortunately  stuart tips his hand far too early in the game  both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal  once the mystery of the killers identity is dispatched  the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable  in fact   stale and predictable  describes the direction that switchback takes in general  falling back on fartoocommon hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere  a climactic fistfight on board a freight train  and edgy law enforcement agents  its too bad stuart wasnt willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead  far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film  played with atypical restraint by r  lee ermey  hes a wonderful  unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions  a film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a filmmaker willing to take a few risks with his casting and storytelling  instead  stuart places his trust in a  name  star who cant carry the material  maybe next time hell throw away that one crucial page in the script  the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story  
1	its hard not to recommend  the others   the supernatural thriller  written and directed by alejandro amen  bar   open your eyes    adroitly establishes and maintains a lowkey atmosphere of menace  the cinematography  by javier aguirresarobe  is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances  but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied  overall  the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old  twilight zone  episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented  only to learn they are actually a childs toy  a military test subject or a department store dummy  watching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter  i always wanted to shout   get on with it   as much as i appreciated the atmosphere and acting in  the others   my reaction was much the same  set at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii  the story focuses on grace  kidman   who tends to her children anne  alakina mann  and nicholas  james bentley  and worries about her husband  charles  christopher eccleston   a missing serviceman  anne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all 50 doors  protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at a time  at the beginning of the film  three servants  mrs  mills  fionnula flanagan   young  mute lydia  elaine cassidy   and mr  tuttle  eric sykes   an aging gardener  join the family  the two that speak seem agreeable enough at first  but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not  to make matters worse  the children are upset  nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts  grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home  only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them  thats essentially the whole story  with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear  earlier  there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside  only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog  the visuals in the otherworldly sequence  courtesy of aguirresarobe  are simply astounding  i also enjoyed the presence of religion  a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural  grace is a christian and answers her childrens questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper  when mother is away  though  the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore  just as real children do  but those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster ending    the others  sets out to be a classic ghost story  but fails to grasp that special something that makes such films more than layers of mist  
1	labelling is sometimes everything  in original mad max  the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future  thus making it one of the science fiction classics  despite the future world being almost exactly like our own  walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors  producers werent thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones  on the other hand  producers were right on the mark  walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america  to make the movie even more distant from future  plot was loosely based on anabasis  historical book written by xenophon  greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago  instead of ancient persia  movie begins in contemporary coney island  where cleon  dorsey wright   leader of the warriors  local youth gang  gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city  the gathering  organised by gramercy park riffs  most powerful gang in the city  is taking place in bronx  that is far away from warriors home territory  but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce  on the gathering  cyrus  roger hill   charismatic leader of the riffs  announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city  crowd is enthusiastic  but the small gang of rogues  led by psychopathic luther  david patrick kelly  uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus  police simultaneously raids the gathering  and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing  and their leader gets killed by riffs  the remaining eight  led by cleons lieutenant swann  michael beck   must now try to get to coney island  but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs  upon its release  despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it  the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status  however  despite being one of the best movies of that year  and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career  the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year  the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly  if walter hills idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america  he failed miserably  the future was much worse than his vision  the youth gangs  as presented in the warriors  are far from shadowy armies  able to take over entire cities  their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic  and for the public more annoying  matters like crime  in their vocabulary  word  arms  is reserved for small knives and blunt objects  and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns  they even have their own  very strict and detailed laws  upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own  many people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors  some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour  despite those objections  the warriors have all the elements of a very good film  the plot is simple  and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes  the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic  although there isnt much bloodshed or gore in the movie  editing is superb  events happen at quick pace  with the exception of middle  when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his wouldbegirlfriend mercy  deborah van valkenburgh  drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory  the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable  yet  the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent  although most of them later sunk into anonymity  best known of them is david patrick kelly  whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains  michael beck as cool  almost statesmanlike leader of a gang  is also very good  and james remar gives good contrast as his hotshot contender for top spot  all in all  this movie is perhaps dated  yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies  
0	this review contains spoilers  but believe me  i dont say anything you cant guess 10 minutes into the movie  i  did  go into this one with high expectations  i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks  i sort of expected another exorcist or the shining  i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film  boy  was i wrong  another garbage slasher flick  the only difference being that  this  one has a story  the story  you ask  well  a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk  he takes it home  somehow getting it past customs    and starts fiddling with it in his attic  lo and behold  after he takes it apart  three demons appear and start taking him apart  but with meat hooks  when theyre finished  his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling  they botch up their cleanup job  however  and manage to leave his heart  or some gland  i didnt really recognize the organ  under a floorboard  the guys brother and his brothers wife appear at the door soon after  and decide to move in  they throw away scumballs belongings  and set up house  turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho  and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage  she starts having some wild hallucinations  later  hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards  slowmo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the groundall from the tiny cut on his hand   said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumballs organ  the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing  it establishes mind contact with wife  who agrees to help him get more blood  because she really wants to be screwed again  so  she helps him kill three businessmen  scumball  at this time  gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back  problem is  he doesnt have any skin  and even after three or four corpses  still doesnt get any skin  he finally gets some  though  but strangely enough  he ends up looking like his brother  guess they couldnt get the original actor back  who knows  scumball  whose name is frank  is not a nice guy  he describes his torture by the demons fondly  as the  ultimate pleasure and pain  since at that level there is no difference between the two   somehow  i dont see getting torn apart by 90 fish and meathooks a lot of fun  this guy is  so  bad   how bad  is  he       so  bad that the  rats  cower in a corner in fear  for good reason  too  he crucifies two of them for fun  and carves a third while the nymphos horsing around with hubby  anyway  hubbys daughter  who  if course  is not  wifes  daughter  starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams  the dumb bimbo meets scumball  and is not impressed  she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle  and brings out the demons  at any rate  the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup  theyre normally quite meticulous about that type of thing  the story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake  the demons are not  however  the good guys  the dumb bimbos the good guy  she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank  but also banishes them to hell or oblivion  were not too sure which  not too shabby for someone with singledigit iq  this is basically a  bad jinn  story  it is an  awful  movie  awful acting  bad focus in the photography  many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks  which is really unrealistic  and looks like the latex that it is  continuity  who cares  acting    terrible   script  horrible  sounds canned  unrealistic  story is soso  but the impact is lost long  long before the film ends  i do think the  rat  acting was quite good  i have never seen rats look afraid  they should get nominated for an award  really good acting there  the best in the movie    the envelope for best furry rodent  please     a   rating would be far too generous  a  110  rating  or 4 in the 4 to 4 rating system  is far more accurate  this movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing  chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog  i can see this film turning into the next rocky horror picture show  people were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen  had to have something to do  dumb  dumb  dumb movie  i was embarrassed that i spent money to see it  it goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself  lots of slime and reddyed corn syrup does not constitute  horror   in my opinion

1	the calendar year has not even reached its midway point  but that hasnt prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscarbait season  bille augusts highprofile adaptation of victor hugos classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epichandsome production values  strong performances by a topnotch cast  a literate screenplaywith one critically missing element  emotional sweep  for those not familiar with hugos original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired  the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19thcentury frenchset version of the fugitive  after serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread  the brutish jean valjean  liam neeson  is paroled  immediately upon release  he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night  he is caught by authorities  only to be forgiven by the bishop  who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow  that he does  and in doing so breaks his parole  which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert  geoffrey rush   who was one of the guards in valjeans prison camp  on his trail  thematically  however  les miserables is a story about redemption  which valjean finds through his dealings with two women  the hardluck factoryworkerturnedprostitute fantine  uma thurman   and her illegitimate daughter  cosette  years after breaking parole  valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau  where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert  valjean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette  mimi newman  from her cruel caretakers  the thenardiers  and raise the child as his own  the  father  and  daughter  eventually land in paris  where the teenage cosette  claire danes  falls for dashing student revolutionary marius  hans matheson   the decadesspanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of  and the danish august turns in his most accomplished englishlanguage work  following the underrated 1994 superstar soap the house of the spirits and last years stylish but highly preposterous mystery smillas sense of snow  he and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace  production designer anna asp  costume designer gabriella pescucci  and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast  neeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable  rushs finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated  oscarwinning theatrics in shine  and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role  the younger members of the cast fare less well  danes is convincing as cosette  but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction  and matheson  while competent  is a less interesting robert sean leonard  as technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is  by the time les miserables was over  my emotions had only been superficially involved  while i was touched by valjeans relationships with fantine and cosette  i was not moved  not even reaching the  touching  level is the cosettemarius pairing  my only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical  as i am sure many others is   and i was dismayed to see eponine  a friend of mariuss who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him  almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation  the daughter of the thenardiers  here she is only briefly seen as a child   her presence would have added some muchneeded conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance  but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine  fantine  was enough  even so  as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season  les miserables is a thoughtful  wellmade  entertaining film  one that will sate moviegoers hungry for a dose of drama before popcorn nobrainers invade the multiplex  
1	this is the movie not the perfume  a slow moving  stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcocks vertigo  it is adapted from an original story by brian de palma and paul schrader  and is directed by de palma and scripted by schrader  set in new orleans  1959  it shows the wealthy michael courtland  cliff robertson  sitting on top of the world  celebrating his tenth wedding anniversary with a party in his mansion  as his lovely wife elizabeth  genevi  ve bujold  and young daughter amy  blackman   both look up to him beaming with joy  his realestate development partner bob la salle  john lithgow  proposes a toast to him and to their prosperous business  while his high society friends give him their best wishes  upon retiring for the night  his daughter and wife are kidnapped in their bedroom and he is left with a ransom note to deliver 500  000 tomorrow or they will be killed  inspector brie  stanley reyes  comes up with a plan to put in phony money and a transmitter in the briefcase exchange  as that will lead them to the kidnappers  but the kidnappers burst out of the house surrounded by the police  taking the two victims with them and in the pursuing police chase  the kidnappers car explodes and goes over the bridge  where none of the bodies were found  grieving the loss of his wife and child  the guiltridden michael builds them a tomb on the expensive land they were to develop  sixteen years later he goes with his partner bob on a vacation and he revisits florence  italy  where he met his wife  when he goes to the church where they met  he sees a young girl who looks exactly like his wife  her name is sandra portinari  genevi  ve bujold  and shes working there restoring art that is decaying  he falls instantly in love with her and doesnt heed bobs warnings that she might be a gold digger and decides to take her back to new orleans and marry her  sandra becomes his second chance to prove his love  as he thinks he can finally put the past behind him  the surprises to come werent really all that surprising  as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson  the emotionally impactful performance by genevi  ve bujold  and the competent acting of john lithgow  it plays too much like a rehash of the masters work  to break any new ground  yet it is still thrilling in its own way  
0	    be warned    the following review contains some harsh language    the blair witch project  quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time  if you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace  because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy  my colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more  then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more  and this worked for him  well  im sorry  but nothing    is nothing      nothing is not more  its nothiiiiiinggggggggggg        i do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing    nothing  is free  available all around the world at a location near you  i am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary  i could just discount them and say   well  i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow   but i have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesnt hold water  there must be some other reason    then again  maybe my first thought is correct  i think ill try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction   when i hear people praising this film  i never hear them talking about what makes up about 97 of this movie  three kids bickering with each other about being lost  they only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time  this being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout  josh    over and over  this film should not be called the blair witch project  it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost    and argue with each other  oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting  josh     and if you thought that was scary  wait till you see a pile of rocks  and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs  oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear  oh yeah  and some goo on one of their backpacks  youve never seen terror like this folks  and you dont want to  the chevy chasegoldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film    for current films  i highly recommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience   this film is an example of marketing with no substance  the marketing was brilliant  and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film  they want this film to be good  and i think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they dont have anything else to praise  that wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along  but this is not it  this film could have been so much better  just think  if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost  and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff  i saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it  she was sold on this film  and then  at one point during it  she turned to me and asked     are we supposed to be scared by this    ive heard one opinion that you  have to use your imagination  to create the fear in this movie  well  i thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do  use their imagination and create a good movie  i mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay 5 bucks for it  but even if you like this idea  then what are you imagining  an entity called the blair witch  some rednecks fucking with these kids  are either of these things really scary when you think about it    ive heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something  well sure thats scary in real life  but there are a lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary in a movie nor even interesting  you could sit in your house and see a snake or a spider and it could be scary  but in a film it wouldnt be  and no  a movie does not need a big budget or cgi special effects to be scary or creepy  actually the less the better  see the equally awful remake of the haunting   but you have to do something  you cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary  if it were real  and by the way  about the shakycam filming in blair witch  arent these supposed to be  filmmakers  who should know how to point a camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly  im not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified  thats justified  im talking about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they cant seem to shoot anything smoothly at all  minor quibble there  there is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers  that the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank  and i think there is a good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves  what was i thinking     but  if they dont  then thats fine  if it works for them then thats okay i guess  i just lament that by making this movie a hit  we are going to be subjected to more of the  nothing is more  approach  pretty soon were going to get some movies like this  just a still shot of a prison jail cell  for 90 minutes  and well have to use our imagination and think to ourselves   my god  wouldnt it be scary to spend life in prison    this movie is the scariest movie of all time        or  a shot of a coffin  with some funeral directors arguing with each other    man  do you know how scary it would be to die        now this is the scariest movie of all time      r 
1	note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  be forewarned  during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction  the cinematic output from its creator  quentin tarantino  has been surprisingly low  oh  hes been busy  doing the talk show circuit  taking small roles in various films  overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn  making cameo appearances on television shows  providing a vignette for the illfated anthology four rooms  everything  it seems  except direct another featurelength film  its been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr  tarantinos new feature film  jackie brown  one of the most anticipated films of the year  and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s  things arent going well for jackie brown  pam grier   shes 44 years old  stuck at a deadend job   16  000 a year  plus retirement benefits that arent worth a damn   as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america  and shes just been caught at the airport by

target is ordell  and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a halfmillion dollars  only through a series of clever twists  turns  and doublecrosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses  although jackie brown marks mr  tarantinos first produced screenplay adaptation  based on the elmore leonard novel  rum punch    theres no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film  while hes adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense  the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead characters now black  in terms of ambiance  the film harkens back to the 1970s  from the walltowall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets  even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions  the opening sequence featuring ms  grier wordlessly striding through the lax  funky music blaring away on the speakers  is emblematic of films of that era  the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995  but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro  of course  nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads  and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists  backstabbing  and deceptions deliciously unfold  the strength of jackie brown is the quiet  understated relationship developed between jackie and max  when they kiss  its perhaps the most tender scene of the year  tenderness  in a quentin tarantino film  sure  thereve been moments of sweetness in his prior films  the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer  or even in reservoir dogs  where a deep  unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters  but for the most part  mr  tarantinos films are typified by manic energy  unexpected outbursts of violence  and clever  often wordy  banter  these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown  but whats new here is a different facet of his storytelling  a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent  and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation  this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr  tarantino as simply a helmer of slick  hip crime dramas with fasttalking lowlifes  and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent  hes the real deal  this new aspect of mr  tarantinos storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character  that of the worldweary  sensitive  and exceedinglyprofessional max cherry  whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching  mr  forsters nuanced  understated performance is the best in the film  he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie  we smile along with him  much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitationera icon pam grier in the lead  with the wags buzzing that mr  tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travoltas thensagging career  as it turns out  ms  grier is solid in the films title role  although nothing here forces her to test her range  i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection  though  shes been working steadily over the years  often in directtovideo action flicks  but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burtons mars attacks  and larry cohens original gangstas  where she first teamed up with mr  forster   of course  its true that her role here was a godsend  a meaty a part as this is rarity for  any  actress  let alone one of her age and current status in the industry  while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone  it marks tremendous growth of mr  tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding  and whose characterizations have never been better  and while the films narrative doesnt really warrant a running time of 155 minutes  its filled with such sumptuous riches  ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining  inconsequential conversations between the characters  that there wasnt an unengaging moment  with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt  itll be interesting to see what he tries next

dateunsound reasoning  you see  net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionalsmiramax surely knows the difference between a member of the online film critics society  ofcs  and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at aint it cool news  no  the  mini major was afraid wed let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit  that scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved  by this writer  at least  franchise  something smells rotten in the state of california right from the getgo  cotton weary  liev schrieber   the former lover and wouldbe killer of maureen prescott  sidneys mother  is juggling phone calls in his luxury car    once considered a danger to society  weary now hosts his own talk show   100 cotton   a clever  if dated  jab at american pop culture   of course  a new ghostface dials him up  and  with memories of screams unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind  we immediately wonder  where is the killer  the backseat  the next car  thrilling prospects  to be sure  but actually  ghostface is at the weary residence  waiting for cottons girlfriend  kelly rutheford  to finishing showering  whats missing from this sequence  and indeed scream 3s remaining frights  most disappointingly  the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes  one of which might spring to life   is an elaborate and attenuated payoff  our other surviving regulars have become estranged  sidney  campbell  is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and passwordprotected locks  while dewey  arquette  acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream 2s moviewithinamovie   stab 3   and gale weathers  cox arquette  headlines a gossipy news program  murder reunites them  as knifewielding ghostface stalks the set of  stab 3   imitating its sadistic screenplayand hishertheir own personal draft climaxes with sidneys death  the appeal of ghostfaces villainy is that heshethey could be your boyfriend  your classmate  your next door neighbour    or a combination of people  scream was the first of its kind  a slasher mystery  with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next  but also who isare the perpetrator  s  and what isare hishertheir motive  ironic selfreflection aside  parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because theres at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume  with scream 3  the novelty of ghostfaces evermutating identity has worn off some  but the character remains conceptually potent  conceptually  the execution of ghostfaces master plan this time around is creaky  because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what wed come to understand in scream and scream 2  the movie gets in the silly habit of saying  all bets are off   in reference to the  rules  of a trilogys third act  but theres a difference between rule breaking and cheating  with the departure of kevin williamson  who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3  that  for reasons incomprehensible to me  was ignored  save the notion of  stab 3    kruger needed to be reined in tighter  and by wes craven  cravens direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects  how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo  the slacker duo of kevin smith movies   akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny  it pains me to write this  but scream 3s comedy is generally laughless  with the exception of welltimed performances by josh pais  as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in cravens music of the heart   jamie kennedy  resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2   and parker posey  through sheer force of will as a bactress   the visuals are much weaker in part three  as wellthe occasional sweeping gesture of peter demings camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before    aside  in the wake of columbine  craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3why the sanctimony  when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves   finally  marco beltramis music cues the suspense too blatantlydo you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2  its mostly silent  sting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere  here  they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nervejangling score  i look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe  the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iiiwoefully out of synch with its prequels  scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish  and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs  the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t   part three must disappoint

1	seen february 15  1998 on home video  borrowed from chris wessell   when it comes to modern gangster movies  its really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre andor just using the word  routine   ive always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea  no matter how many times its been used before  can provide for a good story and  donnie brasco  clinches this idea  its not unlike most of the great films of the genre  yet it never apes anothers style as it has a good layer of authenticity  even if its core is a tad stale  the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it  we meet lefty  pacino   an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk  he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this  somehow he comes across donnie brasco  depp   a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isnt afraid of lefty and his rep  and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him  its clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately  telling him all the tricks of the trade  i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit  however  we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone  an fbi agent working undercover  a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer  the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor  a brief history of the mob  definitions of their slang  and where their money comes from and who it goes to  the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements  however  the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original  most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works  probably from watching other gangster movies   and although this attitude comes across  the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable  thankfully the film doesnt become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime  and instead opts for character development  much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie  pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would  hes old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does  just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be  we learn of his accomplishments  which are quite impressive within their context  and when he complains about not being made top boss  its easy to sympathize with him  newell constantly plays up this aspect  making it a major theme which works well in the long run  as donnie is constantly impressing and even oneupping lefty  its hard to tell which emotion is more powerful  the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob  or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed  most of the film tells the story of donnies life in mafia  which creates for many subplots and individual conflicts  but doesnt always seem to come together as a whole  the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout  even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar  the resonance to donnies actual assignment varies  he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress  but it doesnt always seem to have much meaning  back home  his wife maggie  heche  is ready to divorce him because hes never a and the family is suffering  since this is based on a true story i wouldnt doubt this would happen  although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic  my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act  or at least any real sense of closure  a climax of sorts does occur  but theres little feeling of a payoff  we get a happy ending  which is good  but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful  aside from a few minor  general flaws   donnie brasco  manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development  it may be routine  but its good  and thats respectful  
0	okay  okay  maybe i wasnt in the mood to watch a mindless action movie  i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii  even while admitting that it wasnt as good as the others  howewer  the latest segal picture didnt look that bad  and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them  i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash  boy  was i wrong  in the first half of the movie  we are already assaulted with segals acting   he is not simply wooden  he is like a wall   gratuitous violence  an incredible plot  sexist and even more gratuitous nudity  and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes  by the end  it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers  not once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided  which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense  of course  in movies like these  there must be a sidekick  and a love interest  in these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model  in the movie   which only functions as a supposed comic relief  by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines   and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie  oh  of course  she appears naked from the waist up  and  of course  segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship  they did not even seem to be interested in each other  i have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie  often  the villain saves the movie  unfortunately  the villains here are cartoonish  stupid and unfunny  unmenacing  how many movies have psycho exspecial forces bad guys  too many  i was able to predict the action all throughout the movie  including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death  the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him  the scene where we are shown the heros superiors are stupid  the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand  etc    simply said  this is moviemaking by the numbers  boring  and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience  my recommendation  if you go see it  bring a watch  youll be looking at it for most of the movie  my  rent die hard  read a book  stare at the sky  do not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid  the real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen  once again  dragged in by my friends  which by the way  liked the movie halfheartedly  they probably like wrestling too     
0	dont let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare  no one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work  and this movie makes a vain attempt at that  any moves to  glamorise his life  which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do  will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness  this movie about his life  although well written  puts too much makeup on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes  rather than lobster and champagne  oh well  lets fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious playwrite  who falls in love with a beautiful woman  gwyneth paltrow  and from her inspiration  several plays develop   romeo and juliet  and  the twelfth night  it is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream and thats how all his plays develop  but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama  but i guess my version probably wouldnt draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen  so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare  when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul  i think not  as for the oscars were they deserved by this movie  i think not  in many aspects  private ryan and  life is beautiful were far superior movies  but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar  as time and again  for reasons unexplained  an undeserving movie will win the accolade  another sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead  over a more polished cate  but i guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being hospitalised  people will start feeling sorry for you  
1	part one of  the strangest movies ever made  series at www  mediajunkies  com by scott watson light spoilers  nothing you shouldnt read existenz has been called  a gooey matrix   and while this is a correct description in some ways  in others it is completely off  the only thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal   real  reality  a major difference is that  the matrix  has a base reality that is obviously the true reality  while existenz does the impossible and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true  and oh what a reality it is  david cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies  naked lunch  crash   but this one is one of the strangest  maybe its because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre  technology is organic  but only some of it  cars are normal  gas stations are the same  cell phones are glowing bug like appendages  you jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus  referred to simply as a  pod    high technology has been replaced with organic creatures  and it provides a truly surreal setting for the characters  a famous game designer  allegra geller  a fine looking jennifer jason leigh   flees a demonstration of her latest game  existenz  after an assassination attempt  she is on the run  from who  im still not sure   and has to save her pod by playing her game with  someone friendly   that someone friendly is her dubious companion and security guard  ted pikul  jude law   unfortunately he is lacking a fundamental requirement for playing  a bioport  sort of a hole in your spine  ok  exactly like a hole in your spine   a bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entraillooking wires from the pod into you  allowing you to play the game  luckily a bioport can be installed easily  they install them in malls   so off they go to get one  after a crazy series of events at the local country gas station  they are able to plug in and play existenz  the plot itself is a surreal melding of conspiracies  reality distortion  chinese restaurants  and multi appendaged amphibian things   its a sign of the times    but the plot  while cohesive in its own creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this universe  cronenberg just slaps this weird organictech world into the viewers lap  and its up to you to figure out how all these things work  and thats the true joy of this film  entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which existenz takes place  you learn a little bit piece by piece  oh  they make pods out of those   and its just enough to get you to accept the world that is presented to you  there are all kinds of twists and turns as the characters wander around  including a fantastic scene in a chinese restaurant that will leave you trying to assemble something out of your moo goo gai pan for months afterwards  also the bioports are occasionally used for things other than porting into existenz  the specifics of which i will leave for you to discover  theres lots of little things that set off the weirdometer  like the little tiny pods that you can buy in the video game store  the two headed amphibian creature  and why that guy at the gas stations name appears to be  gas   it all adds up to a supremely far out trip  and given the choice i think i would rather live in the matrixs virtual world    oh wait  i already do

0	  virus  is a monster movie without a monster  any movie with a hurdle that large to overcome had better be pretty damn good otherwise  sadly   virus  does not deliver  on any level  the movie opens with the russian space station mir about to transmit something  we never find out what  to a big boat with lots of satellites on it  sudddenly  a wave of colorful lightning comes flying through space  and winds up destroying mir and using it to transmit itself to the aforementioned big boat  cut to seven days later  we meet donald sutherland and his band of seafaring vultures  see  they spend all their time sailing around looking for deadinthewater ships to rescue  and then collect the reward money  at least  i  think  thats what they do  along with many other things in the film  their reason for being out in the middle of the ocean isnt really explained  so  they stumble upon this big boat with lots of satellites on it  and decide to haul it back to russian waters  the only problem is  the crew starts disappearing onebyone and turning into borg  yes  borg  complete with the red laser beam in place of an eye  apparently  this alien lifeform can only survive if inside something electrical  so  it creates makeshift machines and uses humans for  spare parts   blah  blah  blah  i could go on forever describing the ludicrous socalled plot  but i wont  suffice it to say the most original thing about this movie is having donald sutherland play an irish man     everything else in this movie has been taken from other  better  movies  for example  many of the machines resemble those found in the littleseen japanese movie   tetsuothe iron man   and the plot is right out of  aliens   the funny thing is  i was actually expecting to enjoy this movie  i have a soft spot for cheesy monster movies  like last years underappreciated  deep rising   but  virus   as i mentioned earlier  doesnt even have a monster  it just has a big pile of circuits and wires and expects the audience to fear this ridiculous looking contraption    virus  is the type of movie that really makes you wonder what the screenwriter was thinking about when he wrote it  besides the lame  monster   its chock full of dialogue that no real person would ever say  and situations that no real person would ever allow themselves to get into  for example  there is a scene late in the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to  negotiate  with the alien  now  i dont know about you  but if i came upon a lifeform that viewed mankind as a virus to be eliminated  i doubt that i would attempt to reason with it  that makes about as much sense as a baby squirrel calmly asking a fierce predator to spare his life  finally   virus  isnt scary  the least the filmmakers could have done was to make the movie just a little scary  as it is  its about as frightening as a box of cookies  skip  virus   if its a cool monster movie you want  rent the far superior  and the granddaddy of this genre   aliens   
1	you may not have heard of lucas  or if you have  you might not think much of it  probably because it stars corey haim  or maybe because its about a little geek who collects insects  or maybe because it doesnt feature slick oneliners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80s  however  you have been missing out on a true masterpeice  the best film of 1986  and the best film about adolescent life ever made  corey haim stars as lucas bligh  a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair  thick glasses  and an interest in insects and other outdoor life  one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him  her name is maggie  a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty  with lovely red hair and a sweet  innocent complexion  maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her  but somehow he interests her  and soon they are talking and getting to know one another  they gradually become good friends  and spend the summer together doing various things  such as studying insects  namely locusts  who come out of hiding once every 17 years   playing tennis  and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover  lucas is obviously in love with maggie  and while she is charmed by him  its clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend  this is not clear to lucas  however  he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate  and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows whats about to happen  we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally  they throw him on stage  right in front of his beloved maggie  surprisingly  he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around  but he takes it too far  and is embarassed in front of the entire school  the next scene is brilliant  maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally  she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened  he rails back against her  in a cruel unfair fashion  in lesser movies this wouldve turned into a confrontation between the two characters  but maggie is written smarter than that  she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him  next we are introduced to another great character named cappie  charlie sheen   he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend  whats interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks  of course anyone with a brain can tell whats gonna happen next  cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas relationship  this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone  shes been assigned to show him how to operate the washerdryer so he can clean his shirt  maggie is charmed by cappies tender undertsanding demeanor  not to mention his shirtless body  this scene is so delicate and sweet  but cappie still has a girlfriend  preventing either one from acting on their desires  desperately trying to puncture the tension  cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room  its not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend  in the films only subpar scene   lucas finally figures out whats going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance  this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself  such as try out for the football team  the last third of the film revolves around this attempt  while the idea seems cliched  the way it is executed is not  there are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up  dave grusins memorable score  played at the perfect moments  certainly helps  lucas is filled with great performances  forget everything you know about corey haim  back in 1986 he had talent  and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3dimensional performance filled with anger  humor  and pain  kerri green is very appealing as maggie  showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her  sheens cappie is almost too good to be true  but sheen makes him beleivable  especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas  there are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popittis ben  a friend of lucas  whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks  also turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina  the girl who admires lucas from afar  when people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s  you hear john hughes this and john hughes that  lucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his socalled classics  but hopefully  like with heathers and say anything  lucas can begin to find its own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald  it deserves more than that  but i dont want to be greedy  
0	if you have ever seen fox tvs special car chase programs  youll have a good idea about the content of ronin  the new action  thriller  from director john frankenheimer  the film involves a mysterious briefcase  that several groups of terrorist want to get their hands on  an irish women  dierdre  played by the truman shows natascha mcelhone   hires a group of mercenaries to assist her in getting the briefcase  among the people she hires are sam  robert de niro   vincent  jean reno   and gregor  stellan skarsg  rd from good will hunting   dierdres groups assignment is too seize the briefcase while the current owners are transporting it  they accomplish this task  but a traitor is in the bunch and the briefcase is soon on the run again  the briefcase stays on the run  as the movie leads the viewer through several plot twists that are badly executed  the writer seemed to be attempting to make a smart action movie  but failed to understand that just because there are surprises  it doesnt add too the credibility of a senseless script  the plot twists get no reaction because they come at a time where no one cares what is going on  after the apparent climax of the film  but to add to the excitement  as i mentioned earlier  there are endless car chase scenes  they are unrealistic and fail to add anything to the story  dont get me wrong  i love car chases  but they were overdone and too long here  we never do find out whats in the briefcase  but i doubt anyone cares by the time they finish sitting through this two hour long attempted thriller  
0	talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters  spice world is the feature film debut of the prefabricated pop band  the spice girls  its intended as a sort of hard days night  but ends up simply hard to watch  when watching the spice girls  im reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick  such as from the smurfs  the snorks  or teenage mutant ninja turtles  in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name  the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles  and about as talented  theres ginger  geri halliwell   the brainy one  sporty  melanie chisholm   the athletic one  baby  emma bunton   the childish one  posh  victoria adams   the fashionconscious one  and scary  melanie brown   the one with a tongue pierced back so far youre almost certain the post sticks out her throat  the film itself doesnt really have a plot  it follows the girls as they travel here and there  culminating at their  first live performance  at albert hall  the action  however  seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas  the various misfires include  an alien encounter  a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls  the shooting of a spice girls documentary  a movie producer  george wendt  trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie  nearly all of which  though incredibly far fetched  seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up   a meeting with a pregnant friend  whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends   a boating adventure  a bus race  clubhopping  wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd    even when they start to sing   and an assorted number of musical performances  press conferences  and general allaround celebrity stuff  whew  for some reason  the film is littered with star cameos  from elton john to elvis costello  from bob hoskins to meat loaf  heck  even roger moore shows up  though he cant decide if hes parodying himself as james bond  or if hes lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld  richard e  grant has the largest secondary part  a thankless role of the bands manager  clifford  the celebrity spotting is partially amusing  and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film  neither amusing or spontaneous  when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring  their songs are alright  but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos  my advice to fans is  stay home and watch that video collection  or at least spin that cd a couple of more times    either option will be more enjoyable than the film  nonfans should know to stay well away from this one  
1	note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  be forewarned  its startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth  the lion king had just cracked 300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history  continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast  since then  though  disneys animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns  with pocahontas  the hunchback of notre dame  and this years hercules successively proving less and less potent  with the once seeminglyimpregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable  and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from foxs anastasia  disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation  the little mermaid  while the animation for the film is  as is typically the case for disney films  unquestionably topnotch  the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation  but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music  the films storyline is fairly straightforward  young teen falls for handsome man  father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter  teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man  except in this case  the chaperone is a crab  the teen is a young mermaid  and the object of her desire is a human prince  what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions  from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric  shes resolutely smitten  and shes such a pure and endearing character that one cant help but invest their heart with her  this simple but touching love story  coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour  makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture  one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it  the voices cast for its motley crew of characters  this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue  which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams muchheralded turn in aladdin  by the release of the lion king and henceforth  the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities  while its understandable that animated features lacking the namerecognition or drawing power of disney  say  baltos use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda  or even anastasias showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack  would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products  its unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy  do we really need to hear  say  demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame  is the films entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice  rather than a voice which best suits the role    im not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan   fortunately  the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid  although perhaps more obscure  are impeccably cast  chief among them is jodi benson  a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you  who voices the films heroine ariel to perfection  with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor  and gorgeous singing voice  ms  benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film    shes the only reason id even consider catching flubber   similarly  samuel e  wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian  the weary guardian crab  he easily milks his lovable characters comic moments for all theyre worth  and his rendering of two of the little mermaids big tunes   under the sea  and  kiss the girl   have become the stuff of legend  pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil seawitch ursula  while kenneth mars booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariels father  king triton  in large roles and small  edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal  and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef   the little mermaid is impeccably cast  of course  the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken  music  and howard ashman  lyrics   who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr  ashmans untimely death  not only are mr  menkens tunes unbearably catchy  but mr  ashmans charming lyrics are fully integrated into the films storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the characters dialogue  and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film  mr  menkens score for the film is equally topnotch  the sequence where eric  voiced by christopher daniel barnes  and ariel tour his kingdom in a horsedrawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr  menkens fine score  it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypsostyled  under the sea  as joyfully crooned by mr  wright  which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song  indeed  one of the many little joys in screening the film during its rerelease was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune  but my favourite is ms  bensons heartfelt rendition of the ballad  part of your world   an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope  wonderfully lyricized by mr  ashman  which  accompanied by the films most dazzlingly polished animation sequence  packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes  during the songs reprise  which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in  the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking  and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history  as of this writing  november 1997 has come to an end  as has disneys limited 17day rerelease of the little mermaid  theres no question that the primary motivation for  if not the films reissue itself  at least its timing  was to reinforce disneys dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to foxs costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture  anastasia  in every respect  the rerelease of the little mermaid appears to be a success  the films 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic 100 million mark  the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video  pulling in close to 10 million in its opening weekend  and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressivelymarketed anastasia in headtohead competition  it siphoned enough from the fox films opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot  allowing for disneys odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away  but although disneys motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were selfserving and protectionist  the real winner is the public  any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one  and its a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen  the little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disneys modern animation renaissance  and one of the greatest animated films ever made  
0	what were they thinking  nostalgia for the seventies is bad enough  but do we really need an eighties film  robbie hart  adam sandler  used to want to be a rock and roll star  but in 1985 hes singing at weddings and having a good time  a romantic at heart  he loves weddings and is just about to get married to his highschool sweetie  when she leaves him waiting at the altar  his tune changes to  love stinks   he meets waitress julia  drew barrymore  who is engaged to a junkbonds salesman and you know that they are going to get together  in fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movie  sandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role  but there is no spark  barrymore doesnt seem to be able to convey anything other than a pretty face with nothing behind it  beauty but no attitude  both characters are just there  bit parts by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show  the eighties are shoved in our face  references to deloreans  madonna   dallas   ivana and donald  burt and loni and  miami vice  get old fast  the filmmakers must have realized that there wasnt much entertainment to the story and thought they could dazzle the audience with humorous period allusions  theyre not funny and it doesnt work  with change on all fronts accelerating more and more  nostalgia appears to have a great appeal  but dont you think we could have more than 14 years before we yearn for the past  maybe we can look forward to a film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino    michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and he knows that nostalgia is not what it used to be   
0	warning  may contain slight mild spoilers  rated  r for intense violencegore  some strong sexuality and language  starring  arnold schwarzeneggar  robin tunney  rod stieger  gabriel byrne  running time  132 minutes we go into a movie theater  boom  the lights go down  our hearts race  we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie weve been waiting to see for a long time comes on  we sit there  watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is  why shouldnt i have know what i was getting myself into  again like this past summers hit  stigmata    end of days  may be worse  its not like this is any kind of original idea  it just throws in some  rosemarys baby   along with  the devils advocate  a little  exorcist  and some  stigmata  here and there  whala you have  end of days  a movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific  sadly but truly again like most recent films  all the good parts are in the trailers  the plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be a hit in the first weekend  and flop in the next  jericho cane  arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role  is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan  living in gabriel byrnes body  and stop him from impregnating christine york  robin tunney  because if he does  and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist  he has to do this before it turns into the year 2000  and strangely hes trying to fight him 5 minutes before 2000 comes  he seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger  in a terrific role  and tries to save this girl leading to an ending thats satisfying  but turns into a typical action movie  thats pretty much it on plot  it does have the razzle and dazzle of a great action movie  and with the 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it  parts you have to wonder where all the money went  as for arnie  good role  ok performance  i think since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts  the thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing to the film  in the trailers it looks like a good scary  action film and ends up being a boring  long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions  gabriel byrnes  who ironically played a priest in  stigmata   here plays satan and gives a good performance but again seems held back and not into his character  two years back al pacino gave a terrific performance in the fun  the devils advocate  and here it seems like the idea of him is in the character also  robin tunney  great performance as always  plays satans main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child  of course rod stieger gives another great performance which really isnt nothing new  the direction by peter hyams is at times a bit overblown  though not nearly as the visual style was in  stigmata   here we are given great camera work  and some great scenes that are terrifically directed but sadly just dont work in this movie  the script written by andrew marlowe has a few witty lines  but again the movie is all style and no substance and by the ending finale climax i was ready to go home  only a few things work here and those are a few of the performances  the writing and visual style  but the storyline and the finished product dont work as well  the sad thing is that  end of days  had so many things going for it  the plot could have been more organized  the action scenes could have been more brainy and less mindnumbing  at times it seems like  armageddon  and started to get old and tiresome  hollywood is running out of ideas bad  and like ive always said before needs new ones  even with its 100m budget  end of days  is less than pleasing  in fact the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over  and easily could have had a 70m budget  maybe i sound crazy  but i am really looking forward to the new exorcist film  and hope that they make it as good as the original  we need to get new ideas and stop recycling old ones just to make money at the boxoffice  we need to get more films like  the blair witch project  that could scare people to death  while people thinking well what exactly is scaring them and how do i know that it is in fact the blair witch  overblown effects  stupid and thin plotline  good performances  disappointing     umm yup those pretty much describe  end of days   
0	this film is extraordinarily horrendous and im not going to waste any more words on it  
0	a life less ordinary  r  while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title  a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided  for this confused  confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle  producer andrew macdonald  and screenwriter john hodge  at the core of this strange film is a fairly basicand  yes  ordinarypremise  after robert  boyle regular ewan mcgregor   an aspiring writer of trashy novels  is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation  he kidnaps navilles  ian holm  spoiled daughter celine  cameron diaz  and holds her for ransom  the joke here is that celine is a willing victimher father threatened to cut her off financially  so she wants revengeand that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme  teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping    and  ultimately  didnt we see this one coming    love  so far  so mediocre  but mediocre is better than dreadful  which this film is  thanks in no small part to the hodges contextual frame for the romance  it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth  so the chief of heavens police  gabriel  dan hedaya  dispatches two angels  oreilly  holly hunter  and jackson  delroy lindo   to earth to hook up celine and robertor lose their angel status  this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture  but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film  as it stands  it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand  not that there is much of a romance to begin with  try as diaz and mcgregor may  celine and robert are too onenote to become very endearing characters  celine is rich bitch  robert is a dullard  as such  it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these twothen again  they never seem to really connect with each other  when celine and robert start to overtly act on their  feelings   it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural  but i am not exactly sure if boyle and companys point was romance  honestly  i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish  boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz  but it remains just thatenergy  not energy in service of a story or even acting  the cast seems lost  especially hunter  whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling  and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film  some violent confrontations involving the angels  who are not exactly angelicin fact  they end up staging their own ransom scheme  some mystical hokum in the climax  and a cutesy claymation epilogue  watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell  stockpiling quirks in the name of cool  instead  the film just gives quirky a bad name  my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic  yes  misspelling intended  whimsy  which comes through in only one scene  an extended musical number where celine and robert sing  beyond the sea  at a karaoke bar  after a verse or two  the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos  and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter  the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard  just relying on the innate charm of the leads  allowing them to build a romantic rapport  alas  not nearly enough is built  for this moment comes to an abrupt end  i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses  but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill  a life less ordinary certainly delivers something  different   but by the time the film was over  i was clamoring for a life more ordinary    i can accept failure  everyone fails at something  but i cant accept not trying  it doesnt matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart   michael jordan 
1	a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings  a prime example of this is 1999s 10 things i hate about you  which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school  less successful was last years adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp  here the setting was the corporate world of new york  now comes o  a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeares tragedies  like 10 things i hate about you  the stage is a high school  a private prep school where odin james  mekhi phifer  is the oncourt general  the basketball teams standout player  julia stiles  featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawkes hamlet  plays desi brable  odins girlfriend  whose father also happens to be dean of the institution  josh hartnett  pearl harbor  is on hand for the villainy  playing the scheming hugo  who sets the tragic wheels in motion  o was actually filmed a couple of years ago  but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy  the movie  directed by tim blake nelson  best known for his costarring role in o brother  where art thou   and written by brad kaaya  is very grim  an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits  and that is how it should be  of all of shakespeares tragedies  othello is the most harrowing  not because of any body count  but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago  whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery  kaayas profanefilled script  after all  these are high school kids  does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts  the young man considers himself the basketball teams prime utility man who does a little bit of everything  pass  shoot  rebound  but is constantly in the shadow of odin  plus his father  the teams coach  played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen  showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood  the script follows the familiar lines of the classic  hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desis fidelity  eroding the stars confidence in those he considers closest to him  affecting both his relationships and his game  it all ends in blood  of course  which is why the movie was originally shelved  the performances in o vary  phifer is at first cocky and selfassured  emotions he handles with ease  he also does quite well displaying odins darker side  his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution  his growing distrust of those he loved  his rage and the erosion of his belief system  hartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit  turning friend against friend  and lover against lover  stiles seems a bit stilted  but occasionally also rises to the occasion  moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight  the film does contain a few missteps  a subplot involving hugos theft of the school mascot is left hanging  also desis actions concerning michael  andrew keegan   odins former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugos machinations  is puzzling  why she would continually be seen with michael  however innocent the circumstances  when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back  it is irrational  but these are minor carpings  overall  o is a stylish and faithful adaptation  if nothing else  it may encourage some people to read the original text  and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature  
1	this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated  there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywoods most famous celebrities  some fabulous animation and a compelling story  this is the best weve seen from disney since  beauty and the beast   1996   this film begins an unspecified time following the happilyeverafter conclusion to toy story  in the aftermath of their earlier adventures  buzz  voice of tim allen  and woody  voice of tom hanks  are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony  content with their  lives   one day  andy broke woodys arm off  while playing with him  woody is now officially discarged and worthless  left with his nightmares  where he lies in a trash can with the other discards  later andys mother decides to have a yard sale  and she collects a few old toys from her sons room  since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang  woody goes to the rescue  leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back  although his mission is successful  he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al  voice of wayne knight  spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale  the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series   woodys roundup   if he can acquire woody  al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit  so  after andys mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy  al steals him  and its up to the other toys  led by buzz  to go into the city to save their friend  and so  buzz  rex  voice of wallace shawn   hamm  voice of john ratzenberger   mr  potatohead  voice of don rickles   and slinky  voice of jim varney   go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend  they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys  there are car chases  gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis  who  by the way  resembles darth vader   meanwhile  woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family  a cowgirl named jessie  voice of joan cusack   a horse named bullseye  and a father figure called the prospector  voice of kelsey grammar   they offer him another life  as a celebrity  a toy in a museum in japan  he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while  before he grows up  and be forgotten  or be admired by children for generations  the problem is  if woody escapes from als clutches and returns home  they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage  a real effort is made in the technical department  the animation is rich and colorful  with lots of wonderful details  the  cinematography  is also extremely improved since toy story  there are a lot of complicated swings  turns and closeups that really make an impression  lighting and filters are used to create a mood  as in a surprisingly emotional moment  jessies remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy  the film contains a lot of inside jokes  such as the one about videogames   and entertaining parodies on  jurassic park  and  star wars   the film ends with the  failed takes   the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv  these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film  but what in the end makes  toy story 2  a memorable experience is not the jokes  its multiple parodies or marvelous animation  it is its heart and emotions  the story about the meaning of friendship  love and even life itself  it is not difficult to predict that  toy story 2  would be a huge economical success  but its artistic achievement was unexpected  unexpected because the first film wasnt much more than a demonstration of special effects  but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasnt produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs  but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film  making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years  this is a big stepaway from the ancient laws of disneyanimation  off course  this is not  antz   it is not as intelligent  this is not a landmark and no masterpiece  but i promise that youll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have  whether this is the best animated film of the year  i dare not say  my choice would probably be  the iron giant   but  along side with  american pie   this is the comedy of the year  i almost lost my hopes for disney  but  toy story 2  proves that disney hasnt lost their ability to entertain  
1	after hearing reviews for woody allens upteenth movie in history   celebrity   range from terribly boring to just soso  my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of  manhattan   my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time  woody allens films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair  so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit handinhand   manhattan  really is one of the bestlooking films ive ever seen  beautiful black and white photography of the citys best areas  etc    a fan cant help but feel visibly moved  the film opens up  with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds  and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack  but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky  with the word  help  being spelled with an airplane  beethovens 5th blasts on the soundtrack  the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment  and its all rather lovely to look at  and then we cut to a film crew  shooting this as the films hilariously banal key moment in the film  where the lead actress in the film  melanie griffith  looking as buxom and beautiful as ever  has to realize somethings wrong with her life or whatever  its a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film  with the great opening shots or without  and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again  a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works  though  for the record  last years  deconstructing harry  came awfully close   what the hell has happened to him  the man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny  but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas    bullets over broadway   though wonderful  relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off    mighty aphrodite  is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story    everyone says i love you  was more of a great idea than a great film  even  deconstructing harry  is admittingly cheap in a way  even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films  if anything  the reception of  celebrity  by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time  its not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is  its him    celebrity  is  yes  a good film  but its only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film  instead of creating the great woody allen world  hes created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about  and hes fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities  so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections  its like  la dolce vita  without the accuracy  the right amount of wit  and the correct personal crisis  woody  becoming more insecure in his old age  choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities  and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny  and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead  much has been said about his performance  dead on but irritating  makes one yearn for the real thing  blah blah blah  but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branaghs performance  though featuring some of the same mannerisms  stuttering  whining  lots o hand gestures   is hardly a wartsandall impersonation  branagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm  which actually allows for his characters flaws to be more apparent  woodys a flawed guy  and we know it  but we love him anyway  because hes really funny and really witty and really intelligent  branaghs allen is a bit more flatout bad  but with the same charm so that  yes  we like him  but were still not sure if hes really a good person or not  his character  lee simon  is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie  hits on extra actress winona ryder  then goes off to interview griffith  who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her  and she denies him    sorta  we then learn  through flashbacks  that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a midlife crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion  he has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts  covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate  so that he can meet them  and maybe sell his script  a bank robbery movie  but with a deep personal crisis    as such  he has divorced his wife of several years  allen regular judy davis   and continues on a quest for sexual happiness  boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film  after griffith comes his escapades with a model  charlize theron  who is  polymorphously perverse   glad to see allen is using new jokes  ha ha   who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of  la dolce vita   following are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen  a relationship that almost assures him success  and his continued escapades with ryder  whom he fancies most of all  his story is juxtaposed with that of davis  who flips out  but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome  friendly tv exec  joe mantegna  who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status  while lee is fumbling about  selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness  davis becomes happy   ive become the kind of woman ive always hated    and im loving it    without doing a thing  the result is a film of highs and mediums  the mediums are what take up most of the film  with sitations and scenes which dont exactly work but you cant help but pat allen on the back for trying  but other places are really great scenes  the opening  the sequence with theron  which is so good that i wished it hadnt ended  a banana scene with bebe neuwirth  droll as ever   and  perhaps the best sequence  a romp with hotashell teen idol  brandon darrow  played by none other than leo dicaprio  who is so undicaprioesque that if any of this fans could sit through this film  theyd never look at him the same way  he ignites the screen with intensity  and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical  and totally heartbreaking for lee  who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read  and finds himself on a wild allday ride with him  they go to atlantic city to watch a fight  they gamble  and they wind up in his hotel room  where darrow gets it on with his flame  gretchen mol  and he lends him one of the leftover groupies  allens writing in these scenes are so good that just for them  id almost recommend the film  almost  but what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that its a mess  despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself  its still a smart and insightful film  though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced  some seem too cartoonish  even for this environment   allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities  as it may seem to be  if it were  itd be extremely outoftouch   but about those who want to be celebrities  and how they equate celebrityhood with happiness  we never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if theyre really happy  they may appear to be on the surface      but we do get close enough to lee and davis character  lee is obsessed with the phenomenon  while davis takes is at arms length  and never gets too involved in what it is  and soon becomes one herself  besides  its witty  and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allens  that great woody allen feel  it may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject  and yes  as a part of woody allens oeuvre  its merely a blip  no  annie hall  but its no  shadows and fog  either   but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him  and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor  like the one in the beginning  and make it work not once but twice  
1	a wonderful little movie that is really interested in its characters and in its theme  the scene of  second best  is laid in wales  james  chris cleary miles  is a 10yearold boy who must live in a home because his father  keith allen  is in prison and his mother committed suicide  james is a mentally unbalanced child  he cant forget what happened in the past  and he dreams of living a happy life with his beloved father  in the home he feels sadly and lonely  one day  a social worker  alan cumming  tells him of a person who wants to adopt him  this person is graham holt  william hurt   graham manages a post office and shop in a village  he is a single and hasnt any real friends  his mother is dead  and his father is ill and will die  graham feels that he has been a disappointment to his parents  there has never been real love between his parents and him  grahams monotonous life would get a new sense if he could adopt james  but graham has not only to convince the institutions  but must also win the love of james  james and graham have to open theirselves  they must get to know each other and learn to understand and trust the other person  james and graham aid each other to cope with their problems  but will their relationship really have a future    second best  is based on a novel by david cook who also wrote the screenplay  the film was directed by chris menges who had made his directing debut with the very good antiapartheid drama  a world apart   198788   and maybe   second best  is even a greater picture  this precise  richly detailed  sensitively and convincingly directed study about a special adoption treats its theme with great seriousness  the breathtakingly intense film shows the necessity of human contact and communication  william hurt delivers an outstanding performance as graham holt  and chris cleary miles is remarkably convincing in the role of the boy  the supporting cast is also fine  especially jane horrocks as debbie  a social worker who is charged to examine grahams living circumstances     second best  is an underestimated masterpiece  its a pity that films like this one are made so seldom  i eagerly await menges next directorial work   the lost son   which will star daniel auteuil  
0	the swooping shots across darkened rooftops suggest a very tim burton movie  but  alas  no caped crusader descends to save  this  film  instead  its a skeletal housemaid  julia roberts  who must bear witness to this unfortunate retelling of  dr  jekyll and mr  hyde   for a few  fleeting  maddening moments  director stephen frears  dangerous liaisons  gets everything just right the tone  the colors  the characters  all the ingredients to make a mostpowerful potion out of valerie martins bestselling novel  yet it fizzles too quickly  the volatile mixture losing potency from the very first scene  casting is a large part of the problem  the story all but collap ses around ms  roberts she doesnt have the range for this kind of drama  her accent also comes and goes  though its nowhere near as glaring as the total lack of chemistry between her and costar john malkovich    he looks the same in both of his roles an incredible fact thats missed by everyone in the story   the very british supporting cast including michael gambon and george cole gives credibility to the smaller parts  glenn close also appears as a madam that the good doctor calls upon  her performance is as close to intentional camp as the movie ever gets and as a bonus offers a likely peek at her upcoming cruella de ville in the liveaction 101 dalmantions  the biggest botch in mary reilly is suspense  there is none  no terror  no tension  nothing  without any weight  wit  or wonder to propel the story  the viewer is left with little more to do than pay attention to the period detail  a few buckets of blood  and stuart craigs fabulously dreary production design  all of which gets old after about an hour  at which point i recommend leaving    the pacing in the secondhalf is especially abominable  if you  do  stick it through  your sole reward is a halfhokey special effect depicting the infamous transformation   mr  frears reportedly recut his film several times  missing several release dates in the process    obviously  no one advised him to throw up his hands and just turn the whole damned thing over to mel brooks  blucher   mary reilly is the second robert louis stevenson story of the month  after muppet treasure island  perhaps mr  frears should consult with brian henson on future projects  i daresay that even ms  piggy is a better choice for a certain roles than julia roberts  and she does have a great chop  
0	last summer  a featurelength version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning  based on the famous 60s television show  the film was an enormous boxoffice flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros  a year later  the studio is up to their old tricks again  with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild  wild west  but it sounded promising  the same tagteam of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld  who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success  is at the reins again  and costar kevin kline is attached to the project  as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects  i mean  what could possibly go wrong  the answer is just about everything  wild wild west is a cinematic abomination  a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate  there are a lot of fancy special effects  and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression  but the script is so deliriously uneven  the entire movie so off course  that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it  at square one  we have a bizarre case of casting  will smith plays james west  a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series  my guess regarding the casting of africanamerican smith is a simple one  the actor  a cozy summertime release  big bucks for all those involved  smith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material  but this is not an ideal role for him  hes too much of a joker  i heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role  and frankly  that sounds a lot more plausible  what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such selfassurance in his eyes  you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office  the plot involves west and crossdressing government agent artemus gordon  kevin kline   who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists  the trail leads to the diabolical dr  arliss loveless  kenneth branagh   a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry  witty southern accent  loveless has taken the countrys top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control  using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns  one such weapon is an 80foot mechanical tarantula  bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right  the visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular  seamlessly blending computergenerated imagery with the western surroundings  unfortunately  all of these effects seem so detached from the story  and can do little to support the films plot deficiencies  which are undoubtedly the main problem  wild wild west is a running gag that never truly works  most of the jokes  usually care of smith  die on arrival  if its one thing that could possibly be the saving grace  its the performances  and even they are mostly offkilter and poorly delivered  kline is admirable  but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot  salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest  because she is viewed as little more than that  window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon  branagh  an esteemed shakespearean actor and director  adds marginal enjoyment to the film  but even he is so utterly weird and overthetop  rarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is  i suppose theres always one turkey of the summer season  a highly anticipated  bigbudget release that manages to completely disappoint  wild wild west is such a movie  and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999  but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office  perhaps after this  audiences will be less assured when they see will smiths name stamped on a summer movie  after such hits as independence day and mib  wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume  
0	anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landons fact based novel the king and i  and its big  expensive and soulless  though goodlooking  its lavish sets  fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meersons script  so much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting  this is jodie fosters first movie since the jawdroppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isnt the best choice to show off her acting chops  shes trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens  the uptight  widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam  now thailand  with her son to instruct the kings  chow yunfat  son in the ways of the west  because  the ways of england are the ways of the world   the king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family  58 kids with 10 more in the way  impressive  no    the eldest prince is none too happy about this   father  have i offended you in some way  why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher    but soon gets to know anna and her stern motherwholovesyou personality better and comes to like her  meanwhile  siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma  the king and his close advisors suspect that this is britains doing which arouses suspicion in siam  putting anna in an uncomfortable position  she is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the kings prejudices  he  though selfrighteous as ever  cant help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly  quietly  develop affections for each other  there is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the kings younger daughters dies  its your classic deathbed scene  with the girls mournful eyes staring at her father  who tries only semi successfully to maintain his composure  anna then comes in and cries a bit  the sequence was there for a purpose  to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer  im usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time  i was just sitting there  my emotions untouched  this remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren  we never develop connections to the characters  never given a reason to care  this ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant  whose last film was ever after  one of my favorites of 1998  i do not doubt tennants ability to put together a decent movie  but anna and the king  aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient  the sets and scenery are gorgeous  but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur  even terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from 75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia  we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view  there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with largerthanlife awe  i liked both foster and yunfat  who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles  fosters generally stoic persona serves her well here  as she is playing a reserved  formal and rather underdeveloped character  yunfat is especially effective  perfectly conveying the king of siams sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts  what does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations  the cast is great  the director is talented  and the budget is lavish  but this illadvised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole  this is an emotionless costume epic  
1	bob the happy bastards quickie review  i must admit  no doubts single  new  is quite catchy  it was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon  the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back  the result  a movie thats just as good as that song  really  it follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend  first we hear about a grocery bagger  sara polley  who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave  with bad results  as a drug dealer feels hes been swindled by her   then comes the story of an english grocery store worker  same store  who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends  where sex  gunplay  and stolen car trouble come into play  then we see the story of two gay movie actors  played by scott wolf and jay mohr  who deal with a cops strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl  sara  with their car  and  finally  we come to another grocery worker  katie holmes  who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer  the one mentioned earlier   really  its all confusing to keep track of in review format  your best bet is to just  well  go  the movie features some very good acting from all angles  and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product  the dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized  not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending  think of it as a  well  ending  the intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie  as its never really confusing and tells different sides of the story  like sliding doors kinda did  however  its better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks  which sliding doors kinda isnt  
1	i swear i have seen the edge before  in fact  it reminded me of the bear  the river wild  and other various films mixed into an entirely different film  however  the edge has done something that most action films should do  and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot  in doing so  the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than  say  the peacemaker  unfortunately  because of those overused moments  we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film  but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head  one surprise  in particular  left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script  action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood  and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us  they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre  intelligence  even horror films have learned this  a genre which is probably the least respected of them all  the river wild was one of the best actionsuspense films i have seen from the 90s  the intelligence of the screenplay  and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day  the edge has the intelligence and smart characters  but this time the lack of originality is the downfall  i must admit that it was very suspenseful  and had an original third half  but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes  this is an example of the final act saving the film  instead of the other way around  as in the lost world   if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes intensity  it could have become a great action film  and i use the term loosely   the edge is pretty much a survivalofthefittest film  but taking screams lead  the edge makes fun of the genres cliches  and then uses them  though not quite as effectively   charles morse  anthony hopkins  is the main character  a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him  for once  we dont immediately care for the main character  instead  we like bob  alec baldwin   a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles wife  mickey  elle macpherson   out in the wilderness  they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic  charles birthday is the same day  and he receives a gold watch from his wife  and a pocket knife from bob  as action films go  these items do have importance to the rest of the story  but quite a bit more than we first expect  soon  however  bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his  personality   charles  bob  bobs assistant steve  harold perrineau   and the pilot head off to find him  and as shown in the previews  hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter  down the plane goes  the pilot is killed  and the three are left to survive in the wilderness  director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow  and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations  he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film  take  for instance  the entire manhunting bear plot  this has been done many times in films with different animals  and even bears  but given the charles intelligence  and bobs uncertainty  many of the cliches are given fresh twists  even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before  my favorite line of the film comes from charles   most people die in the wilderness because they didnt do the one thing that could save their life    thinking   despite the predictability of the main plot  a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise  and made me smile when i realized that everything isnt as it seems anymore  i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise  so instead i will avoid it entirely  the first twothirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along  and some of charles survival techniques seem possible  even making fire from ice  tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear  but whenever the bear is present  the characters lose all sensibility  i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water  why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across  i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while  thankfully  we already have begun to care for the characters  and so we let this small detail slide  but some of the technical details are awkward  such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make  where did they get thread and needles    the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature  and borders on phenomenal  anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance  creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day  hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles  but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences sympathy  something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs  alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen  it sure is better from his fair game   baldwin can be a good or a bad character  and here he succeeds at both in a way  you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end  and baldwin is able to handle the doublenatured photographer  elle macpherson gives a good performance  albeit slight  she isnt in the film all that much  but for the scenes she does have  she handles as an actress  not as a model  harold perrineau is a good actor  and his scenes are nice and underplayed  he is eliminated early  and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable  the edge is rated r for graphic violence  some gore  and language  some of the violence is a little too disturbing  even for me  this film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to  but too many cliches bog it down  director tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts  david mamets script  though  has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat  and the acting is solid  the best thing about the script is the ending which doesnt end with the normal highstrung action sequence  but with a small detail involving a certain gift  its a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear  and by the way  most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear  way to go  bart  
0	has hollywood run out of interesting characters and plotdriven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and a gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs  in enemy of the state  that is exactly right  a few parts the net  and a few parts conspiracy theory  enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997s lame brained men in black  will this guy ever get a real role  he has the bruce willis syndrome  the plot is bascially smith  playing a lawyer  getting into hot water with some high government murderers  who assassinated a powerful political figure earlier in the movie  when a tape of the killing gets into his hands  he inlists the help of an old conspirator  hackman   and  at the end  er    you know  enemy was one of the worst films of last year  not only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight  the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven  and i didnt like how smith always magically outsmarted the badies when all the other extra characters  seeming more intelligent than smith  somehow got run over by a truck  enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek  insurrection  i know these two films are different in  well  everything  but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me  somehow  quality cant overshadow quantity  
0	cradle will rock is the latest effort from directoractor tim robbins  while he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995  dead man walking   he gets a little overconfident and sloppy here  the story is confusing  and filled with many subplots  so ill try my best and explain it as simply as possible  the film is based on a  mostly  true story about a federal theater in the 1930s  that produced a play  the cradle will rock  that apparently was offensive to some  so the government shuts it down  its during the time of the depression  and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs  or are poor  between this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots  about those who work in theater  or those associated  also along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience  tim robbins just keeps piling on political views  and characters  that we just give up on the film  or in some cases walk out  for robbins it may be a nice achievement  but to me it seemed more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue  and fancy outfits  i thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast  unfortunately are all uninteresting  except for a few  let me recap what each important character does  so please bear with me  its the least you can do  especially if you were considering seeing this   ill begin with those involved with the play  theres orson welles  angus macfadyen  who of course is the director of the play  the producer john houseman  cary elwes   marc blitzstein  hank azaria  the writer of the play  emily watson  a woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock  outside the play theres the  ventriloquist  bill murray  who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk  joan cusack   another subplot involving a painter diego rivera  ruben blades  whos unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage  john cusack   theres a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories  susan sarandon  philip baker hall too name a few  but those that i mentioned  were the most significant to the story  anyway  most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted  except for emily watson  who does another great job  and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack  who always delivers through thick and thin  now although most of the film was weak to say the least  there were some nice moments and some involving subjects  but all this is overblown  sure the free speech segment was a nice feature  but not when it becomes repetitive  the whole film is like this  and its basically nothing but a headache  on the brighter side  tim robbins direction was masterful  his camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas andersons latest magnolia  only smoother in my opinion  but even that cant make a movie that much better  although it has its moments  not many of them  but theyre there   cradle will rock stays true to its title  because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over

1	who would have thought  jim carrey does drama  when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show  i thought   what a hilarious idea for a movie   however  it was an even better premise for a drama  the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man  that man is truman burbank  jim carrey   truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly  cristof wants to keep it that way  christof is the  god  of this madeup world  he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles  there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world  but they failed and life went on as normal  the opening parts of the film introduce to trumans world  we see what he is doing at his current age  then we get a flashback at his past  it may seem a tad boring  but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start  the film can be described in one word  weird  it seems like such a simple idea  yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of  but andrew niccol did  it seems like a warped idea  but it is andrews idea and he did wonders with it  jim carrey actually lived up to the hype  the hype  whether good or bad  always focused on carreys ability to do drama  no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be  the only thing they doubted was carrey  and he showed them all up  jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars  i do not think he was the best actor  but he deserved the nomination  he plays truman burbank  the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world  he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years  but then strange things start happening  he ventures into the wrong elevator  a light crashes in front of him  his father comes back and is then pulled away  we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show  but truman does not  and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish  carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama  laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife  she plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point  peter weir does not make the cast perfect  and their flaws eventually lead to trumans escape  the story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down  despite carreys greatness  the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris  who plays the  god  of trumans world  he displays the pressure he is under  the world he has created  he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life  the action moves at a good pace  and rarely gets sluggish  but  the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show  it really makes you think  maybe your brother is an actor  maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show  some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking  or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for trumans arrival  and when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon  noah emmerich  delivers his dramatic line  all of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative  i was not only enjoying the film  i was overwhelmed by genius of it  overall  the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood  jim carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million faces  but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best  andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection  the truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film  
1	in many ways   twotg  does for toughguy movies what la confidential did for police stories  theres savviness in its writing and a mature patience in allowing the material to unfold  but  i suppose  we wouldnt expect less from christopher mcquarrie  who was responsible for giving us  the usual suspects   his writing talents are still in tact as he brings to us a bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but dimwitted thugs and a plan gone awry  the two goons are parker and longbaugh  ryan phillipe and benicio del toro   these two men show the hardened wear of those who have always had it tough  their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive  given the choice of minimum wage or petty crime  theyll always choose the latter  yet  they are incredibly foolish planners  actually  these two never really have a plan  they just improvise along the way  hoping that their bravado and arsenal of guns will take care of anything that they might have overlooked  their next scheme  which they cook up about as fast as a mcdonalds burger  is to kidnap some surrogate mother named robin  juliette lewis  that was hired by some welltodo family  if all goes well  theyll receive a nice bit of ransom money and life goes on  what parker and longbaugh do not realize is that robin is carrying a baby for the chidduck family  whose patriarch is a feared crime boss  moreover  two bodyguards  nicky katt and taye diggs  constantly escort her  these two protectors find an eerie sense of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life and death situations  they would rather die than fail  thus their bravado level is equally high  but it seems that the testosterone levels of parker and longbaugh are a bit higher  and they employ some unusual but funtowatch tactics to pull off the kidnapping and to outrun the pursuers in a sort of slowmotion car chase down a series of alleyways  the next hour or so  we watch the chidduck camp regroup and assess their situation  during this time  additional plot lines come into play and more and more details are revealed  because the chidducks can not go to the police and because of the special circumstances involving the kidnapping  we are introduced to more characters that will help to influence the outcome  we discover that not everyone in the chidduck camp is loyal to the cause  as a result  there are undercurrents of a conspiracy  and elements of betrayal and subterfuge  the sepiatoned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings  shrills of intrigue and crescendos that tell us of life and death situations that are about to occur  the momentum and the coolness of the film  however  begins to fizzle in the last 30 minutes  which featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try to make their way off with the ransom money  you can expect lots of bloodletting and an odd denouement  in fact  you may admire this film more than you like it  yet  for the most part   the way of the gun  stays on target  it feels cool with its elements of conspiracy and gunplay  and smart for its invective dialogue and tough guy poetry  
0	all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos  please raise your hands  thank you for identifying yourselves  now would you all please go away  your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade  and it shows no sign of abating any time soon  it isnt just the strobe light quality of your twentycutsperminute editing  or the numbing overuse of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised  featuring the music of     no  it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected  banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles  welcome to the club  scott kalvert  your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and onedimensional  serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole  dicaprio stars as jim carroll  the new york poetsongwriter performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based  as the film opens  jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey  mark wahlberg   pedro  james madio  and neutron  patrick mcgaw   one night  jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine  and shortly thereafter to heroin  jims addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral  as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach  bruno kirby   kicked out of his home by his mother  lorraine bracco   and drops out of school  along with mickey and pedro  jim becomes a victim of the street  living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower  the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years  but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner  screenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carrolls posse  resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic  but now with equally unsympathetic friends  as a film  the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale  a 100 minute long  just say no  public service announcement  but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie  jim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie  but i suppose that his pseudosensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out  perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those  good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd  that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be  i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd  without a character who changes in any appreciable way  the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strungout cohorts  all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack  director scott kalvert doesnt have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work  so he substitutes silly slowmotion photography  selfconsciously funky camera angles and choppy editing  on only one occasion  when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in  are any of the gimmicks effective  mostly  they just draw attention to how hollow the story is  they also dont allow leonardo dicaprios performance to be as strong as it could have been  for every impressive moment  like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money  there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics  dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors  particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an exjunkie who tries to help jim straighten out  but kalvert wont let character interaction define this story  he wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star  shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting  at isolate moments  the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprios talents  far more frequently  it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like  
0	  battlefield earth  is the best comedy of the year  it has to be  the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider  bad movie syndrome struck me again  so after witnessing how much  battlefield earth  has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles  i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster firsthand  is it as bad as advertised  oh yes  very much so  the plot is incomprehensible  the acting is atrocious  the special effects are mediocre  the action is dull  the implausibilities are legion  the dialogue is cringeinducing  the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny  i dont even want to continue reviewing this movie  id like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible  but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory  so here it is  the premise is basically a ripoff of  planet of the apes   only minus the apes and philosophical discussion  and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo  the year is 3000  the psychlos have conquered earth  and the human population has been enslaved  only a handful of humans escaped to radiationrich areas to escape the aliens  they live out their lives in fear  one man  johnny goodboy  i know  i know  tyler  barry pepper   ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos  there he confronts the psychlo head of security  a big  ugly  klingonlooking creature called terl  john travolta   pressed into slavery  johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back  meanwhile  terl is faced with his own problems  he has recently learned that hes stuck living on earth  which he hates  for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big mans daughter  he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology  this is where the plot gets ridiculous       so the  mananimal  can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos cant go  terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself  of course  his plan doesnt work  so many things wrong with this movie  where to begin  how about with travolta  whose hollywood clout brought about this  the cinematic version of scientology guru l  ron hubbards scifi novel  early previews for  battlefield earth   with constant shots of a makeupladen travolta cackling like lex luthor  had me  and several audience members  remarking   what the hell is travolta thinking   the movie did nothing to stem such remarks  all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here  terl cackles after nearly every line  and so does every other psychlo  of course  this makes every scene hilariously overwrought  no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary  the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america  but ceos generally dont laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees     you were going to be promoted  but now youre not  fwahahahahahahahaha        its no big surprise terl loses to the humans  hes an idiot  he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book  he underestimates his enemies  assuming hell win just because hes smarter    he uses the word  leverage  like some sort of scientologist mantra   not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero  he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos language and technology    why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me   he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him  no wonder this guy never got his promotion  the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention  why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive  how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open  how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1  000 years  and how do all these previously braindead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly  theres a whole lot more to scratch ones head about in  battlefield earth   bring a scorecard to track the plot holes  director roger christian shoots  battlefield earth  in the most distracting way possible  tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason  all the characters appear to be standing on the walls  and its awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue  the action sequences are atrociously edited  every one turned into an endless slowmotion parade that drains all potential excitement  are these things really so hard to construct  my respect for supposed  lightweight  action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in  battlefield earth  how badly an action sequence can be shot  this movie is an absolute headache  its not just the shot selection and editing  the movie  quite frankly  makes no sense  for most of  battlefield earths  running time  i just didnt know what was happening  it didnt have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical  though they certainly are   i really had no idea what the hell was going on  when i pieced the plot together later  it didnt look any better  heres how much of a disaster this is   battlefield earth  is already the worst movie of the year  and its going to take something really  really inept to top it  the only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it  in fact  id think that hubbards cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible  thatll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again  
0	my first press screening of 1998 and already ive gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list  what an auspicious beginning  welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l  a  and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere  firestorm  the directorial debut of dances with wolvess academy award winning cinematographer dean semler  is the first of the new years crop of movies  as our story opens  the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are  smokejumpers   we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl  where one of the gungho guys is taking a romance quiz from  cosmopolitan   having the time of their lives  they then jump into the middle of a burning forest  when  even in the beginning  the director cant get the small parts right  you can sense the movie is in trouble  with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasolinefilled cars  smokejumper monica  christianne hirt  tells them to get away from their soontoexplode vehicles  not bothering to shout nor even get close to them  she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people  miraculously  they manage to hear her and move away  in a movie that specializes in cheap shots  the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building  as it does throughout  overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f  windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girls face  our shows two heroes  the crews chief  wynt perkins  played laconically by scott glenn  and his secondincommand  jesse graves  played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal  enter the burning house looking for the little girl  in a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames  the manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse  this mawkish show cuts back to monica  who has a lifeordeath decision to make  the chopper with the fireretardant chemicals has only enough to save one group  will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monicas two firefighting buddies  she has only seconds to decide who will be saved  yes  she goes for the majority  but  miracle of miracles  the other three come out alive anyway  not content with a traditional firefighting story  chris soths screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape     hoods in the woods   is what the  groundpounders  yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire   along the way  shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis  who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father  who was a marine drill instructor  most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing  he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck  arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside  using a ramp  he shoots straight out of the top of the buildings attic  and when he hits the ground  he just rides off in a cloud of dust  when the film isnt using some stock footage of actual forest fires  the simulated ones look hokey  editor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions  the ending  with its sick twists  manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie  perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby   its not as bad as some of the television sitcoms   firestorm runs mercifully just 1  29  it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers  
1	luckily  some people got starship troopers  some people knew it was supposed to be silly  for those of you who didnt  how could you miss it  from the very beginning  when we see an interactive internetlike promotional video for the armed forces of the future  it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly  i guess without blatant oneliners and home alone style slapstick  some people just dont recognize such goofy humor  such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned  first thing to do before seeing this movie  lighten up  meet the equivalent of  beverly hills 90210  meets  mighty morphin power rangers   four close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces  which  in the future  means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country  johnny rico  casper van dien  is ready to join the infantry  mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez  denise richards  has enlisted to be a pilot  dizzy flores  dina meyer  has enlisted as a trooper  and its possible shes joining merely to follow rico  whom shes always had eyes for  if you saw these three on the street  youd automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers  for never has a movies cast looked so much like the cutout cover of  seventeen  magazine  the lone nonsupermodel  carl jenkins  played by doogie howser himself  neil patrick harris  is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division  the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie  er  carl out of the picture    good call  now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters   right off the bat  rico becomes the star of the show  far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time  but a horrific accident during a standard training exercise  which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen  leaves rico ready to call it quits  with his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on  johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home  well sorry  rico suave  but theres no place like home  especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it  thats right  the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnidlike alien beings that a can of raid just isnt going to destroy  with a sudden change of heart  and clothes   rico is back in the game  following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs  what starship troopers really is  is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on  the soap opera like love affairs of high school  the love for scifi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group  etc  nothing is taken seriously  its almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless  but with its sly and futuristic approach  its not as recognizably so  its a spoof so subtle that many wont recognize the spoofery  if you deem this as scifiaction  youre wrong  its scifiactioncomedy  with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2  starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well  gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film  but the gore  too  is meant to be cheesy  yes  its graphic  but its also brutally phony  and thats what makes it such great fun to watch  not since the old  mr  bill  skits on  saturday night live  has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch  people were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated  perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters barbie dolls as young children  with the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely  its a good chance this is the case  whether were fully aware of it or not  starship troopers has its slow parts  but its truly an alternative to your typical scifiaction flick or lame juvenile comedy  aside from the intentionally cheesy gore  the special effects are quite astounding  when the spaceship passes a meteor  its quite an awesome spectacle  visually crisp and captivating  if youre looking for brainless fun  this is the epitome of your search  a beautiful cast  awesome special effects  fastpaced action  campy acting  and a whole lot of gore  this is brainless heaven  just remember not to think  
1	when i first heard that romeo  juliet had been  updated  i shuddered  i thought that yet another of shakespeares classics had been destroyed  fortunately  i was wrong  baz luhrman has directed an  in your face   and visually stunning piece with this film  it revolves around the two rival families  who in this version each run multimillion dollar enterprises  these rival companiesfamilies are the capulets and the montagues  the younger generation of these two families have formed gangs  who despise one another  as the storylines goes  romeo montague  played by leonardo dicaprio  and juliet capulet  claire danes  meet at a fancy dress party  and it is love at first site  i never believed love at first site was possible until i saw this film  the scene in which romeos eyes meet juliets through the fish tank is one of the most memorable  of course  they cannot publicly reveal their love  for their families are arch enemies  so they marry in secret  this is where things begin to go wrong  the story  as with all good shakespeare  ends in tragedy  the cinematography is spectacular to say the least  and the soundtrack provides the perfect atmosphere in which to  lay our scene   as the film says  there is very little to criticise  the performances are convincing  and several of the films younger stars may find that it provides a launch for their careers  the modernisation of the script is ingenious and clever  despite the well known storyline  this latest version still manages to cause tears among many members of the audience  especially the younger generation   and this is certainly a great credit to the film  
0	the first in a very long list of things wrong with  i still know what you did last summer  is the title  think about it for a second  if the last movie was called  i know what you did last summer   wouldnt the next movie have to be  i still know what you did two summers ago   if anyone working on this movie had an i  q  greater than five would have thought about it logically and said   hey    wait a minute   but alas  the people behind this film are obviously idiots  so i wont hold them to that  what i will hold them to is the fact that they have a pretty bad movie on their hands  even for a teenage slasher flick  i guess im one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original film  emphasis on the  kind of    it wasnt great or anything and maybe not even necessarily good  but at least it didnt have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like its sequel did  there are just so many problems with this movie that its hard trying to figure out where to start  first of all  i guess  is the setting  the movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take place in the bahamas  other than the fact that the producers wanted a seaside setting  exactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking a radio contest to get julie james  jennifer love hewitt  one of the only survivors of the first film  and her new college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up  the movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through  in one scene  julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress cant get out  no matter how hard she tries  when julie discovers shes going to slowly fry to death  she screams for help and her friends come to her rescue  now  this is all fine and dandy except for one thing  instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth  why not just turn the freakin thing off  in another scene  one of the characters  after having their significant other all but decapitated by the man in the slicker  says to julie   just dont tell anybody it rained the whole time   oh yeah  ive just been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered  but hey  ill crack jokes anyway  after all  it is in the script  the films only saving graces are a few wellexecuted suspense sequences and a really cool cameo by the  reanimator himself  jeffrey combs  he brings some good comic relief and life to an otherwise limp movie  way to go  jeffrey  i have a hunch that the reason this film fizzles while the first one at least kept its head above water is the recent absence of writer kevin williamson  with  scream  and even its sequel  he displayed a real talent as a screenwriter  his ear for dialogue and the terrific endings he puts on all his films make him a standout from all the rest of the horror writers  and i think  i still know  has really suffered by not having him on board  the cool atmosphere is still there this time around  but i just didnt like the characters or the writing as much as i did in the first one  even though the movie doesnt have williamson  it still has a hacky ending  trying to do what kevin did with the first two  scream  s by  some may consider this a spoiler  but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever  then you should be able to guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes  having two killers and  this time  having one of them being a family member to the other  i think someone in the audience put it best when  after the movie had ended with another  the killer is back   cliffhanger  he said  who is this time  the grandma   all in all   i still know  tries to be as successful as the first the film was  but really fails in the attempt  i mean  its okay when slasher movies ripoff each other  but when they start copying themselves    
1	one of the funniest carry on movies and the third with a medical setting  the main story is about dr  james nookey  jim dale  who is disliked by his superiors  frederick carver  head of the hospital  kenneth williams   and dr  ernest stoppidge  charles hawtrey  who seems to dislike everyone  they attempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible and all the blame is laid on nookey  carver learns of a possible job opportunity from wealthy ellen moore  joan sims  on a distant tropical island and gets nookey trannsferred there  when nookey arrives at this island  he meets gladstone screwer  sid james  who has lived on the island just about all his life  screwer is in possession of a wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients  dr  nookey returns with the drug to england and sets up a new slimming business with ellen moores financial backing  however  nookey and moore face opposition from screwer who goes to england to cash in on the drug  and carver and stoppidge who want to know the ingredients to create a rival drug  the performances are all very commendable  sid james has a slightly ambiguous character to play this time and he excels in his role  kenneth williams  as usual  plays the unpopular and cunning head of the hospital  joan sims is entertaining as the wealthy benefactor and jim dale should really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey  charles hawtrey plays an outofcharacter role as dr  stoppidge  the nasty and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch  some critics have said that this combination of hawtrey and stoppidge does not work well  but i think that it at least gives hawtrey a new part to play instead of the usual dimwit characters  as a matter of fact  hawtrey is suitably cunning in the part  other regulars in the movie include hattie jacques as the matron yet again  but this part is probably her most boring matron  and barbara windsor as nookeys love interest and unofficial womens lib campaigner  goldie locks  both jacques and windsor play their parts well  patsy rowlands appears briefly as miss fosdick  and there are very small cameos from wilfrid brambell  from steptoe and son fame  and peter butterworth  the jokes are mostly very funny  the story is quite appealing  and the regulars seem interested in what theyre doing  although it is another medical carry on movie and some of the jokes are borrowed from previous movies  it still comes out on top  it is the best medical carry on  because of the above factors  a mustsee carry on movie

stamp  pernilla august  frank oz  ahmed best  kenny baker  anthony daniels screenplay  george lucas producers  rick mccallum runtime  131 min  us distribution  20th century fox rated pg  mild violence  thematic elements copyright 1999 nathaniel r  atcheson a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review  ive attempted to obey this rule in recent months  but to do so would be impossible in this case  the fact is  nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them  the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people  for me  they calibrated my creativity as a child  they are masterful  original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time  and they still hold up pretty darn well   i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release  but that doesnt make me any less dedicated to it  on the contrary  the star wars trilogy  and the empire strikes back in particular  are three items on a very short list of why i love movies  when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the ninefilm series  i got exited  when i first saw screenshots from the film  well over a year ago  i embarked on a yearlong drool of anticipation  and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving  i was ready to see the film  but then there was the hype  the insane marketing campaign  and lucasfilms secretive snobbery over the picture  in the last weeks before the picture opened  while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater  i was tired of hearing about it  i was tired of seeing cardboard cutouts of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell  i just wanted to see the movie  reader  do not misunderstand  i did not have an antihype reaction  the hype was unavoidable  i understand and accept the hype  its just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released  five minutes into the phantom menace  i knew there was a problem    who are these jedi knights   i asked    why are they churning out stale dialogue with machinegun rapidity     why arent these characters being developed before their adventures     why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film   these were just some of my questions early on  later  i asked   wheres the magic of the first three films   and  why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes   by the end of the film  i was tired  maddened  and depressed  george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless  mindless  summer blockbuster  the phantom menace is no star wars film  take away the title and the jedi talk and the force  and youre left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time  its an embarrassment  i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored  or a new theme is examined  or a special effects shot isnt used  there are a few of each  but theyre all token attempts  the fact is  george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects  this is not what i wanted to see  i didnt want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth  but i did  the story centers mostly around quigon jinn  liam neeson  looking lost and confused  and his apprentice  obiwan kenobi  ewan mcgregor  who scarcely has a line in the film  and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo  naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation  their contact on naboo is queen amidala  natalie portman   the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people  after picking up jar jar binks  a completely cgi character  voiced by ahmed best   they head to tatooine  where they meet young anakin skywalker  jake lloyd  and his mother  pernilla august   quigon knows that the force is strong with young anakin  and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys  the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious  neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters  there isnt anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form  the way lucas has handled it  however  it unsatisfactory  first of all  we dont learn one single thing about quigon jinn  not one thing  what was his life like before this film  well  i imagine he didnt have one  thats why he feels like a plot device  this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role  and why hes recently retired from film  i dont blame him  honestly   obiwan  a character i was really looking forward to learning more about  is even less interesting  mcgregor has just a few lines  so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere  since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace  lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie  things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine  young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshedout character in the film  and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role  i was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene  rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting  and when anakin says goodbye to his mother  i found it moving  also fairly good is portman  and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written  jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters ive ever had to endure  but hes more interesting than most of the humans  as soon as the relativelybrief segment on tatooine is over  its back to the mindnumbing special effects and depthless action scenes  ive seen many movies that qualify as  special effects extravaganzas   but the phantom menace is the first one ive seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie  the reason is obvious  george lucas has no restraint  i cant say that i didnt find the effects original  because i did  the final battle between darth maul  obiwan  and quigon is visually exceptional  as is most of the film  but i also found the effects deadening and tiresome  my breaking point was near the end of the picture  as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters  in the background  we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky  and i wanted that to go away  cant we have one stinking scene that isnt bursting at the seems with a special effects shot  i got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours  and then theres the question of magic  what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi  i have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel  john williams familiar score is no help  nor is lucas direction  i think it comes right down to characters  there are none here  i longed for the magnetic presence of han  luke  and leia  but i got no such thing  and what about the ridiculous expectations  mine werent that high  i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving  a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects  instead  i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show  i dont hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it  id like to forget that it exists  and yet i cant  its here to stay  i can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them  because if they dont  then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series  
1	i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video  it really scared me  and i didnt want to go see it  however  after i heard about how wonderful it was  i wanted to see it  i didnt get a chance to do so  until now  the film  disneys 25th animated feature  opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale  a long time ago in the land of prydain  there was a king so evil  that his spirit was captured in the cauldron  it has been hidden for centuries  and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors  and with them rule the world  and destroy it  then  we meet a farmerwizard  dallben  and his young apprentice  taran  taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a pigkeeper  they have a pig named henwen   one day  as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath  the pig goes crazy  and dallben then realizes  after watching hen wens thoughts through a bucket of water  that taran must hide hen wen in the forest  an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron  and only hen wen has the power to show its location  taran leads hen wen into the forest  but of course  he loses her  and tries to go find her  along the way  he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi  who desires munchings and crunchings  much to his dismay  besides  he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen   when he hears hen wens squeal from far away  though  he races to her rescue  only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants  taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned kings castle from far away  taran climbs the castle walls  and brings himself into the castle  where he attempts to rescue hen wen  he manages to do so  but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon  there  he meets princess eilonwy  and her magic bauble  another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron   and the two escape through the deep castle walls  along the way  taran finds a sword in a burial chamber  and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm  who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie  the three manage to escape the horned kings castle  but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic  as they rest in the forest  gurgi reappears  claiming to have found hen wens trail  he leads taran  eilonwy and fflewdurr  by way of pig tracks  to a whirlpool  suddenly  they all get sucked under  and they meet the fairylike fairfolk  taran is reunited with hen wen  and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva  he then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron  it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world  with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli  the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage  it turns out to be no ordinary cottage  three comically strange witches inhabit the place  when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron  they agree to let him have it  in exchange for his sword  taran agrees  much to eilonwys horror  but at least they get the black cauldron  but  the cauldron cant be destroyed  only its evil powers can be stopped  the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will  never to return alive  things take a turn for the worse when the horned kings henchmen capture taran  eilonwy  and fflewdurr  along with the black cauldron  and lead them back to the castle  taran  eilonwy  and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors  this is the most horrifying scene in the film  because here  a dead army comes alive    just when all seems lost  though  gurgi reappears  and rescues taran  eilonwy  and fflewdurr  taran is about to jump into the black cauldron  but gurgi stops him  not wanting him to throw his life away  gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron  and the deathless warriors decay  taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi  but he is forced to do battle against the horned king  he kicks the horned king away  who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron  where its powers immediately destroy him completely  taran  eilonwy  and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned kings castle just as it selfdestructs  the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away  but fflewdurr stops them  saying that they never give anything away  they bargain  in response to this  the witches offer taran his sword back  but taran instead has a new trade  the cauldron for gurgi  the trade is made  gurgis seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group  as taran cradles him in his arms  though  gurgi stirshe is not dead after all  the happy group then returns home  where hen wen  brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past   dallben  and even doli  await their triumphant return  as spectacular as it sounds  the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times  before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions  he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron  a sword and sorcery tale for the studio  bringing this book to the screen was the studios fondest dream  miller  who entitled himself as the executive producer  promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects  when micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio  the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron  by this time  things had gone really rocky for the animation department  many of the studios old men had retired or died  therefore  the animators suffered a hard time making this film  originally budgeted at 25 million  the costs raised to 40 million because of constant changes on everything  and when it was finally released on june 24  1985  the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics  but somehow the film flopped  the film was rated pg and the film  although disneyfied from lloyd alexanders chronicles of prydain  which is what this film is based on   was much more scarier and darker than disneys other previous efforts  such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound  which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it  in addition  other critics rejected it for having no heart and unmemorable  compared to other disney animated features  but whatever the real reason  the black cauldron was a financial disaster  grossing only 21 million  the failure of the film grounded the studios animation department  and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale  and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studios reputation  the next two disney animated features  the great mouse detective and oliver and company  although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron  didnt do much better  although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective   only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features  as for the black cauldron  it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron  finally  the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released  because of all this  you might ask yourself  was the black cauldron really such a bad movie  the people who had seen the film didnt think so  in fact  many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film  but of course  they denied it  for a while  it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video  until september 1997  disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom  few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc  including me  and for those who hadnt seen the film yet  i am included here   they got quite a treat  but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors  about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating  in the uk  the u rating means universal  suitable for all ages  kinda like their own version of g   somewhere online  a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said  bring back the black cauldron    and because of that  disney finally decided to release the video to the united states  before that time  rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed  like the uk video  so that it would get a g rating  and that they would add in songs  those rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron  would  be released in its pg rated version  even still  when it was finally released to the us  some reaction was mixed  some felt that it was indeed cut  but some felt that it wasnt  but these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable  since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available  as for myself  when i saw the movie for the first time  on converted ntsc video   i didnt expect much at all  in fact  i had heard so many mediocre things about it  that i didnt think the film would ever be such a good film  much to my surprise  when i saw the first few minutes of the film  i was asking myself   this is the same film everyone saw  the one that flopped at the box office  the one that critics and filmgoers alike called  a bad movie   this doesnt seem like all of the above  instead  its a classic in its own right  the film has a wonderful cast of characters  theres taran  grant bardsley   an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pigkeeper  the storys hero  the critics have said that taran is not likeable at all  but the opposite is true  he is brave  loyal  and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on  theres a likeable character here  not that hes the only likeable character in the film  theres gurgi  john biner   a lovable little  uh  thing who remains loyal to taran  even though they dont quite hit it off at first  but another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman  a dwarf named creeper  phil fondacairo   who is loyal to the films imaginative and sinister villain  the horned king  voiced gruesomely by john hurt   yet he also fears his neck  the other characters  including the sidekicks  a spunky  but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm  and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret  although pleasant and likeable  arent quite as well rounded as they should be  the story itself is an adventurous one  a quest involving the mystical pig  hen wen  the black cauldron itself  and an army of deathless ones with everything  a hooking opening to a spectacular finale  elmer bernsteins music also tells the story perfectly  in a dark  yet calming manner  the animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios  even though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good  like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth  the animation overall is top notch  overall  this film is an entertaining endeavor  fans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one  except young kids  there are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disneys other films  although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary   which is the main reason why this film is rated pg  fans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie  even though it doesnt have all of the ingredients of a true disney film  this film is a classic in its own right  and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given  that better chance has finally come  whatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared  and the film has finally achieved its place among disneys most proudest achievements  i cant help but think though  whatever would have happened if the black cauldron  was  a box office success  
1	no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordans harrowing  humorous  horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabes novel about young lad francie bradys  eamonn owens  descent into madness in 1960s ireland  on one hand  it was difficult for me to become invested in francies story because he is such an unsavory character  unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs  nugent  fiona shaw   on another hand  i found it difficult to laugh at some of francies darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick  needy child  having been raised by a drunken father  stephen rea  and a suicidal mother  aisling osullivan   on yet another hand  i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his  for lack of a better word   bad  deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them  however  the butcher boys power is undeniable  and the film as a whole is unforgettableperhaps because it is so disturbing  what makes it so unsettling is the francies overall winkwink yet matteroffact attitude about everything  expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie  rea again   think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs  and youll sort of understand  anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens  love francie or hate him  you cannot take your eyes off of owens  the butcher boy truly is a twisted  unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable  in the lobby after the screening  i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was  i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust   that movie was so unfunny     i didnt know what to expect  its like something you chase for so long  but then you dont know how to react when you get it  i still dont know how to react   michael jordan  on winning his first nba championship in 1991    or  my thoughts after meeting him on november 21  1997 
1	the thoughtprovoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of  leila   a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui  that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirtyyear career to gain u  s  distribution  thanks to first run features  although unfamiliar with mehrjuis previous directing efforts  perhaps the reason for this is that  while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country  the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers  set in modernday iran   leila  begins on the birthday of the title character  leila hatami   after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband  reza  ali mosaffa   as leila and reza set off to visit his parents  and then hers  where a birthday celebration has been planned  things seem rosy for the couple on the outside  but for leila  life isnt quite as sweet  earlier  on that very same day  leila had gone to see her physician  and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child  when all of the conditions are ruled out  and leila passes up the possibility of adoption  reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her  and doesnt care at all about having children  nonetheless  leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby  which is the societal norm  and her selfesteem is not helped at all by her domineering motherinlaw  jamileh sheikhi   whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news  reza is her only son   bluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and  in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition  she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with  leila hesitantly agrees  and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens inadequacies  reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like  even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesnt give her full blessing  there are no easy answers to be found within  leila   a film that thoughtfully examines the central characters unfortunate plight  as well as the inner workings of leila herself  told through matteroffact narration  almost completely taken over by her own shame  she has no option but to agree to her forceful motherinlaws requests  even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman  maybe because  leila  is from iran  the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences  since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence  leila  however  is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily  but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy  no matter what the circumstances  one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza  who married only three months after their first meeting  but obviously love each other very deeply  it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful  and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible  although seemingly unimportant at first glance  an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing  nearly uncontrollably  actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half  as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another  ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday  and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her  these  small  moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn  outraging sequences in the latter half  in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road  and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman  left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage  foolishly unbeknownst to reza  leila prays each time that the date will not go well  so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer  refusing to stay over at her parents house  the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman  and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency  leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart  as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below  despite her initial agreement to such a thing  leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza  whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him  sure  the whole second marriage was his mothers idea  but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children  then he could have still easily backed out  couldnt he  in the pivotal role of leila  who appears in every scene  leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable  injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength  unavoidable vulnerability  and utter despair  unlike most american films  in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences  hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words  every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa  as reza  a man who  i believe  does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife  but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else  for all of its strong aspects   leila  isnt a perfect film  on a technical level  i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed  and concerning the plot developments  the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before  mehrjuis decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice  particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful motherinlaw  played memorably by jamileh sheikhi  despite these minor missteps   leila  is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new yorks cinema village  and then on may 21 in la  the thoughtprovoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales  and when the climax arrives  leilas selfworth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation  to which there is no return  its difficult to not consider how leilas culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided  had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila  the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme  was going through  
1	jake kasdan  son of one of the best screenwriters around  breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hardtocategorize detective story  part mystery  part comedy  part character study and part romance  for the most part  kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film  daryl zero  bill pullman  is a modern day sherlock holmes  the parallel is present down to his love of music  though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin   and his addiction to drugs  amphetamines  rather than morphine   he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces  the case about the man who lied about his age  or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes  however zeros observance of the fine art of detachment  though it makes him a brilliant private investigator  makes him somewhat of a selfimposed outcast in society  he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr  watson  i mean steve arlo  ben stiller   arlo is not happy with his job  he is thrilled to be around zeros brilliance  but his bizarre behavior  and strange requests  are frustrating to the former lawyer  and theyre even more so to his girlfriend  jess  angela featherstone   who is fed up that her boyfriends boss means more to arlo than her  this is the situation when a new case comes knocking  gregory stark  ryan oneill  hires zero to find his lost keys  it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring  and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence  now  stark is being blackmailed  and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end  to solve this case  zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell  however  this is when he is vulnerable    and this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic  gloria sullivan  kim dickens   who may be involved in the blackmail scheme  for the first time  zero has to question his own objectivity  as he finds his client less and less sympathetic  zero effect is weakest in its obviously  wacky  scenes depicting daryl zeros odd behavior  such scenes might be appropriate in an outandout satire  making zero an ace venturaish character  however  theres a much meatier movie in here    it just takes a while to get out  thats not to say that theres not a place for humor in this film  in fact  some of the best scenes are ben stillers wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer  however  the overthetop scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film  and they arent funny enough to stand on their own  once the investigation is underway  however  zeros brilliance really begins to shine  his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlocks own  as the mystery begins to unfold  zeros deductions lead the plot in interesting directions  but never lose the viewer  zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well  zeros relationship with gloria is lowkey  but it hits all the right notes  however  we are always kept distant from glorias character  shes given plenty of development  but we never understand what she is thinking  perhaps that may be intentional  to place the audience in zeros zone of detachment  but  on the whole  it is frustrating  bill pullman  when hes not spacing out  creates a vibrant character in daryl zero  theres one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years  and it is shockingly moving    expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character  but one which fits in well  and  although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called  zero  seriously  it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name  although zero effect is a bit awkward in places  it is a strong debut for kasdan  and shows great promise

1	historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s  for many critics  scholars and  most importantly  film producers  it was a thing of the past  something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of blackandwhite television and noncgi special effects  but in 1995  same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago  there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor  producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre  and  same as in the case of dances with wolves  he was awarded for his effort with  oscars   the name of the film was braveheart  and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson  the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace  1272  1305   in his time  english king edward i  longshanks   played by patrick mcgoohan  has almost completely subdued entire british isles  including scotland  whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by  ius primae noctis  and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights  although english had killed his father many years ago  young scottish commoner william wallace  played by mel gibson  doesnt care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron  played by catherine maccormack   murrons death changes that and wallace takes arms and  together with small but dedicated band of followers  begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country  through time  more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallaces ragtag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge  but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves  especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce  played by angus macfadyen   who wouldnt like to have a simple commoner as a national leader  braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson  so it wouldnt be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann  however  even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre  the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism  while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytalelike vision of picturesque castles  splendid costumes and knights in shining armour  gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard  short and brutish  this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle  where handtohand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details  never seen since verhoevens ultranaturalistic flesh  blood  compared with this naturalistic approach  most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays  braveheart also employs humour at the right places  not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences  but also to underline its downtoearth atmosphere  so different from previous historical epics  what makes braveheart  larger than life  is his protagonist  mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and  as a result  character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero  wallace is more than superior to his enemies  both physically and mentally  yet he is able to show his sensitive  more vulnerable side  naturally  when the character is based on epic poems  most of historical accuracy is going down the drain  which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s   however  even those who dont particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace  especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel  played by sophie marceau  and make her a child  because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended  and final scenes arent as effective as they should be  mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful  and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors  most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan  whose cold  calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema  brendan gleeson  who would later become famous for his role in boormans general  is also very good as wallaces trusted companion  as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosystricken king john balliol  david oharra is very entertaining as wallaces irish ally  and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his consciencestricken character of robert the bruce  women in this film have rather thankless roles  especially marceau as onedimensional french princess  catherine mccormack as wallaces wife was more interesting  but she was eliminated from the picture early on  from the technical point of view  the film is also very good  photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen  on the other hand  the musical score by james horner employs too much of modernday instruments for period piece set in medieval times  although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike  braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism  the main reason for that was the fact that gibson  among many historical facts  chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of  longshank  s son prince edward  played by peter hanly   he is not only presented as a villain  but also as one of the less competent in villains camp  and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in  politically correct  hollywood  to make things even more obvious  good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward  rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals  however  although the message of this film might look rightwing  it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century  according to that ideology  oppressed classes  workers  peasants  are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and  as such  they are more radical  less willing to make compromises and more efficient  on the other hand  privileged classes  aristocracy  bourgeoisie  are more likely to

1	tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever  not surprising  considering its tiny us100  000 budget  to date it has earned in excess of us130 million  thats a shocking 100 times profit  rumours have it that a smart internet marketing ploy was so successful in gaining cultlike fanatics  by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews  the film just exploded in the boxoffice  raking in millions on its opening weekend  shot in 16mm and video  i suspect    the film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in search for the legendary blair witch  audiences are put in the firstperson perspective in the entire misadventure  often wobbly and blurry at times  it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning  this is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the 3 disappeared  edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences  tbwp is simply smart  filmed to look as if it was really a stockshoot by a bunch of students in search of the blair witch as a school project  one may suspect  like yours truly  that its simply a lazy but smart approach to filmmaking  simply amazing in that respect  i must say  talk about impact  oh yes  tbwp does have quite a bit  in fact most audience will find it deeply disturbing  i did  especially the last bit but im not revealing more  you have to see it for yourself  i cant help but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become  could it be that finally  an indiefilm has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal  or was it all simply a ploy by the big players right from the beginning  well  i guess the fact stays  tbwp is highly original  clever and will most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk and think about for weeks prior to watching this film  no gore  no special effects  i just cant get over how terribly smart this film is  
1	andrew lloyd webbers musicals  preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice  present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time  webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as  oklahoma    or the slapstickness of shows like  a funny thing happened on the way to the forum   they instead tackle hot issues from our past  and view them differently  and pack them together with redundant  catchy music  as well as thoughtful lyrics  like  jesus christ superstar   which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective  in the cool tune  superstar   a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didnt spread his message wider    evita  takes an inventive stance on its topic  this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator  juan per  n  eva  who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention  much like the woman playing her  madonna  although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent  among other things     evita  deals with the rise and fall of eva per  n  a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan  jonathan pryce   then died at the young age of 33  creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di  the two do share a bit in common  although it wasnt like di slept to  the top    webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals  but they always have a point for doing it  here  they wish to expose her for what she is  but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks  her lying  and covering up for her fascist husband  but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions  and her death was very sad  its also a musical  with almost no words not unsung  the film plays like a rock opera  much like their  jesus christ superstar   with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals  even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics  which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience  but also a very entertaining one  after all  this is a musical  and webbers musicals never undermine this  they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth  walking on a fine line between the both  and never stumbling on either side  this is why the beginning of  evita  is kind of a letdown  okay  it is a letdown  im not saying the opening moments are bad  because theyre pretty good  but what comes after is a lifeless  unentertaining  and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer  jimmy nail  into taking eva to buenos aires after a onenight stand  in the musical  its a fun  energetic sequence  culiminating in the show stopper   buenos aires   which is also lifeless  then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer  instead of her leaving him  where she ends up singing the sad tune   another suitcase in another hall   which was meant for a later character  screwed over by eva  the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft  seeming like parker and oliver stone  who adapted it for the screen  are afraid to present her for what she is  even while its being narrated by a hater of evas  the omnipotent  antonio banderas   who presents her in a negative light  for a while  it looks like alan parker cant pull it off  however  the film pulls itself together in a flash  and after that song is over  and the giddily nihilistic song  goodbye and thank you   where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend  is magnificent  darkly comical  and just gleeful  from this point on  the film is hypnotic  satisfying  and satirical  no more punches are thrown  and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact  we see eva woo and marry juan  get him out of jail  rise to stardom  falter a bit  come back  and then gradually die of cancer  i think it was because of cancer   more importantly  many of the themes from the musical carry on with this  as well as some fillinginthegaps reconnassaince work  juan  who is pretty underwritten in the musical  is given some extra scenes  and exposed as what he was for eva  an accessory  a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan  and understand his sadness more than we did before  from the  goodbye and thank you  number on  the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation  and saved a government  even while it left the nations people downtrodden  but despite this  the nation still loved eva  and when she slipped into death  the world mourned her because she was a star  thats when our narrator  ch   comes out to show that she wasnt the great woman she really was  and expose her fame  describing this character is difficult  mainly because he has no real realistic background  hes said to be based on the revolutionary ch  guevera  but the two probably could have never met  like they do in the film   but he serves as a perspective on eva  but even his perspective cant help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death  alan parker  no stranger to bizarre musicals  hes done  fame    the committments    bugsy malone   and  pink floyd the wall   the latter which is absolutely brilliant   nails the film  exposing everything for what it is  we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should  by the way it is presented  his direction is manipulative for a reason  to show the mourning for what it is  and there is energy throughout  with lots of bright colors  and scenes which are cinematically entertaning  as well as enriching and deep  such as the balcony scene where she sings  dont cry for me  argentina   and her death sequence  which is poignant becuase of how sad it is  madonnas golden globe winning performance is much like the movie  starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly  remaning there for the rest of the film  at the beginning  she looks like shes too busy concentrating on her singing to act  but she eventually gets it right  though never really getting the presence of  say  patti lupone  who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s   her death  though  is brilliant  her singing could be better though  i know she took lessons to improve her range and all  but it still sounds like shes trying to hard  she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding  like    patti lupone  i heard her sing on an old  evita  cd  and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her   but its generally very good  although not up to the brilliance the role really requires  antonio banderas  who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days  im one of the few people who thinks he rocks   is extremely comanding in his performance  presenting a lovable narrator  his singing is very good  though nothing compared to the original  mandy patinkin  he does have a pretty good singing voice  and a great range  and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome  although very brief at times  in his role as juan  seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade  although it gets off to a rocky start   rocky  s polite for what it really is   it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical  like the other musical released in 96  woody allens  everyone says i love you    its a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead  but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance  
0	the catch phrase for disneys rocket man is one spoken by fred z  randall  harland williams   the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes    it wasnt me   he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others  well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is  williams cant take all the blame  but he sure cant justify himself with his own simple tag line either  fred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy  turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wideeyed at a poster of the earth  as a 30yearold  fred hasnt grown up much  but at least hes somewhat closer to his goal  now designing astronaut software for nasa  when an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured  nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void      fred  yes  although hes an obviously klutzy moron  nasa doesnt think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program  and time itself  has ever known  for the first part of the film  we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park  he laughs  he screams  but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than childs play  his passive approach to the program eventually leads to many recordbreaking feats  much to the dismay of cocky counterpart  mission commander captain overbeck  william sadler   who once held the records  overbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet  one being astronaut julie ford  the stupids jessica lundy   and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist  from here on out  we are subjected to one lame gag after another  dealing with snot  laxatives  and flatulence  you know  standard kid movie material  almost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist  williams is awful in his first starring role  we get the feeling that if jerry lewis and peewee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring  williams would be it  while hes not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany  stupid comedy  hes just as unlikeable  to say it more understandably  jim carrey might annoy you more  but this guy is even less funny  why  because while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such a role  his performance is too understated and boring  classic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy  stan laurel  for example  was so innocent in all his troublemaking that we were immediately fond of him  peter sellers  as inspector clouseau  was so selfassured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip  it was humor at its best  williams  on the other hand  cant garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his antiglory  as for the rest of the cast  including some bigger names in smaller roles  beau bridges and shelley duvall   nobody is worth watching whatsoever  this is just another example of the fastfood equivalent of cinema  massproduced  less than mediocre  over priced  and hard to stomach  giving it oneandahalf stars is  extremely  generous  but even ill admit to laughing a few times  the amazing thing is that even in a theater packed with little kids  laughter was something rarely heard  even from the children  i must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they didnt crack up over every little thing  then again  maybe they were asleep  some people might think critics are harsh on kid movies  claiming adults arent the targeted audience and therefore arent meant to  and wont  enjoy them  sadly  its also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if its presented right  a twohour still shot of a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there  but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast  which could easily do the same thing  and saying that a parents perspective isnt important is quite a poor theory to have when theyre the ones who take the kids to these films in the first place  
0	a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted  and shortly after during the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city  the lawyer  kevin lomax  keanu reeves  is not offered a job yet  he is asked to simply pick a jury  he accepts  the jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered a job with the firm  making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money  but a gorgeous apartment  he convinces his wife  mary ann  charlize theron  to make the move to new york  the first case given to him is a big test  a  winless  case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement  the charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal  his new boss and partner in the firm  john milton  al pacino  is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing  explaining many of his philosophies on law  women and sex  and angles the promise of a blissful  wealthy life  kevins next case is a dream case  given to him by milton himself  much to the chagrin to his colleagues   defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law  although kevins career is taking off  his home life is not doing very well  mary ann is starting to have numerous problems  she is experiencing severe depression over kevins long hours  and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls  their faces becoming horribly disfigured  kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife  he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with  then focus all of his attention on his wife  not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer  connie nielson  also working with the firm  mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home  kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife  and gets disturbing news from his mother  judith ivey  about the mystery concerning the identity of his father  he also starts to lose control of his case  kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man  that man is his boss  mr  milton  a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself  kevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store  but how do you defeat the devil  why is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd  do filmmakers really believe that  normal  courtroom drama doesnt fit the bill and they have to juice them up  the courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom  which wouldnt have been too bad if it werent keanu reeves trying to pull it off  i give reeves credit for trying hard  but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character  just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short  charlize theron defines the term  overthetop  in her performance as mary ann lomax  a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in  2 days in the valley   the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino  but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess  maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil  and you can tell he is having fun doing so  but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him  its pretty standard stuff  including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom  please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled  but i have to get something off of my chest  in 1986 i remember watching a movie called  wisdom  with emilio estevez and demi moore  and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do  what i like to call  guess what  it was all a dream  scenario  in  wisdom  the two lead characters are killed at the end  only to have one of the characters  wake up  from an apparent and say  gosh  im glad that didnt really happen    i considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with  well  the same thing happens in  the devils advocate   and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream  perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan  since it failed and he is the devil   but the point is that the last 90 of the film didnt happen  i know its a stretch  after all it is a movie and nothing really happened  but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that  of course  the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one  as i recall   wisdom  was a decent film    the devils advocate  is not  the devils advocate directed by taylor hackford john milton                   al pacino kevin lomax                 keanu reeves mary ann lomax            charlize theron mrs  lomax                   judith ivey eddie barzoon                jeffrey jones christabella                   connie nielson

1	it was easy to fear the worst  begin with a classic 1960s television series  add a big budget and an alist star in the lead role  and stir  script  you ask  who needs one  kid    weve got ourselves a formula  that was my fear  a bloated monster without any sense of direction  then  much to my amazement  everything that could possibly go wrong    didnt  the fugitive is as lean  taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years  under the direction of andrew davis  1992s under siege   the fugitive grips you by the throat from the outset and never lets go  expect box office to go through the roof  deservedly  and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones  the premise is a simple one  dr  richard kimble  harrison ford  is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer  a man with an artificial arm  after an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry  kimble finds himself on the run  his one goal  to find the onearmed man  andreas katsulas  before u  s  marshall sam gerard  tommy lee jones  finds him  where the fugitive surprises the most is the script  by jeb stuart and david twohy  in a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic  the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence  its attention to detail and its respect for the audience  in an early sequence  kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard  slick back his hair and change into a lab coat  on his way out  a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesnt know is kimble to zip up his pants  its a small moment  but it punches home the urgency of kimbles situation  and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget  later  while trying to lose himself in a parade  kimble thinks to drop his overcoat  the most likely way hed be recognized from behind  its these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimbles tells gerard that hes too smart to be caught  he may just be right  credit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators  the bus crash which allows kimbles escape is a spectacular sequence  as is a leap from a dam into the water below  the action is crisp and brutal  and never romanticized  special kudos go to director davis for maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the singlemindedness of the two leads  and what a pair of performances those leads are  tommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard  because he manages an incredibly challenging feat  for the first third of the film  there is really no  villain  per se  kimble is on the run  and gerard is out to find him  it would have been very easy to turn gerard into a malevolent  vindictive inspector javert  but that never happens  instead jones plays him as a sharp  committed man whos just doing his job  so that when he responds to kimbles comment   i didnt kill my wife   with a matteroffact   i dont care   we know exactly what he means  its not his job to determine guilt or innocence  its his job to bring in a fugitive  this is a well written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form  the only unfortunate thing about jones stunning turn is that its likely to overshadow harrison ford  and thats a shame  for his entire career  ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an action hero  however  he does a fine job with the less flashy part of kimble  always keeping at the forefront the advantage this man has because of his intelligence  the fugitive could only work to its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed to be on equal footing  and ford is up to the task  this summer has been loaded with actionsuspense films  and most of them have been doing brisk business  however  its time for clint  sean  and various dinosaurs to step aside  the chase is on  my advice is to catch it  
1	in some respects  rush hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking  the hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone  the cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble  all chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element  the duo must always be completely mismatched  the hero has to say some smartassed comment before  and after  shooting someone  however  that doesnt necessarily make for a bad film  rush hour is jackie chans first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector  1985   proving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foreign film markets  ie  hong kong   jackie chan is given much more free reign than before  still  some diehard jackie chan fans may be disappointed  as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes  which he views as too short  according to one interview   this film takes a familiar theme of east meets west  jackie chan is lee  the straight laced inspector who is imported to help deal with a kidnapping case  while chris tucker is carter  the loudmouthed  destructive cop that is promoted to the fbi to help him  or  at least  so he thinks  also another classic notion in action films  the fbi must always get in the way of our heroes   despite the necessary conventions of action films  rush hour is some of the most fun youll spend and hour and forty minutes watching  jackie chan continues to be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen  continuing to perform his own stunts and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks and punches  chris tucker  familiar from his whiny  annoying role in the fifth element is more palatable  complementing jackie chans straightlaced character  however  jackie chan still maintains his comicslapstick edge  as expected of him and his films  perfectly downplaying the fishoutofwater routine through his characters attempts at mixing into american culture  he makes up for the down time his character experiences  when he is in action  however  youll be amused and dazzled  still being inventive in the use of objects to beat people up  in this case  a steering wheel  a serving tray  and a barstool   jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu  chris tuckers character may come across as irritating  yet is also humorous  since hes not a physical actor to the level of jackie chan  he uses his main weapon  his mouth  hence  the tagline  fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west   while dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare  it is appropriate for the film and still very funny  while not necessarily poignant  attempts at character development and growth between characters come off surprisingly well  lees knowledge of american pop culture  thats the beach boys    when contrasted against carters lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick  while carter teaches lee hiphop dance moves  while rush hour is not at the same level as police story 3 and 4  known in north america as supercop and jackie chans first strike  respectively   it more than makes up for the poorly received films operation condor and mr  nice guy  with its appropriate mixture of high kicks and lots of laughs  it makes for a fun film  as well  it is a true departure from jackie chan films  as it is missing one common element  a whiny female costar  
1	after a rather disappointing  mary railly   stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise  this is one of the best surprises of this season  a sweet  small budget comedy with a big heart  in fact its not even a comedy  its a drama or even more precise  a clever satire on human relationships and needs  based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby  high fidelity is a wry and likable story about a mans quest for fulfillment and happiness  rob gordon was a dj  it seems that he could make everything spin  except his own life  now he owns championship vinyl  a little musical store  somewhere in new york  when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend  a gorgeous blond attorney  life suddenly looses every purpose  decimated  humiliated and on the verge of a mental  and emotional  breakdown  he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been  about whats right and whats important  he starts  categorizing  life  dividing it into  top 5 lists   and the most important is the  top 5 list  over the most painful breakups of his life  starting with 5th grade  when he found his young girlfriend with another boy  though you might think that people change  grow more mature with age  it just doesnt seem that way and all robs relationships were different versions of that first  where did he go wrong  was it he that screwed up  or maybe life just stinks  while he is lost in his own selfpity  he must think of the  top 5 list  over his needs for the future  find the right elements and mix his life together  with clever parallels to the cult of celebrity  music and with incredibly direct narration  it addresses the average audience member  in other words  people like you and me  although a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter  and frears  the director  the acting is equally important as the written word  and here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned  he is simply superb  it is as much his movie as it is frears  the film would not be the same without him  cusack  whose character is sadder  wiser and 35  brings intelligence and warmth to post mod irony  most of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera  not an easy task  but cusack pulls it off  his interpretation feels so emotionally right  so incredibly realistic and precise that frears message simply cant be ignored or overseen  the other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job  both  and jack black are fabulous  even catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts  not just looks beautiful  however  the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as robs coworker and friend dick  this is such an impressive achievement that its almost worth a oscarnomination  he is simply a joy to behold  otherwise  everyone are in their place  and at the right time  all part of frears colorful blend  pretty much like edward nortons  keeping the faith   this film doesnt follow any formula or belong to any genre  its dramatic  tragic  sarcastic  comic and even cynical  but never bitter or angry  its a little bit of everything  pretty much like life itself  nothing seems unreal or staged  it reflects reality as a mirror  as you watch it  you go through the same emotional problems as the main character  you feel and think and reflect  this effect has become a rarity nowadays  although its primarily about the perils of love  high fidelity is secondarily about pop music  rob owns championship vinyl and his employees  timid dick  todd louiso  and overbearing barry  jack black   are fellow music snobs  music is the language in their lives  the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives  and so does the movie  it is as much a musical film as anything else  as robs journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments  in the end  you have gained something while watching it  its not the film of the century or even of the year  its not an special effects extravaganza  it doesnt require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed  its a small movie about the big things  and even though it does not contain heavy philosophy  you feel as if you have experienced something of significance  and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time  
1	  jaws  is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen  the movie opens with blackness  and only distant  alienlike underwater sounds  then it comes  the first ominous bars of composer john williams now infamous score  dahdum  from there  director steven spielberg wastes no time  taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly  right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean  and once  jaws  has attacked  it never relinquishes its grip  perhaps what is most outstanding about  jaws  is how spielberg builds the movie  he works it like a theatrical production  with a first act and a second act  unlike so many modern filmmakers  he has a great deal of restraint  and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act  until then  he merely suggests its presence with creepy  subjective underwater shots and williams music  hes building the tension bit by bit  so when it comes time for the climax  the sharks arrival is truly terrifying  he doesnt let us get bored with the imagery  the first act opens with police chief martin brody  roy scheider   a new york cop who has taken an easy  peaceful job running the police station on amity island  a fictitious new england resort town where there hasnt been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years  the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july  and the mayor  larry vaughn  murray hamilton   doesnt want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money  brody is joined by matt hooper  richard dreyfuss   a young  ambitious shark expert from the marine institute  hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it  his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark   its a perfect engine  an eating machine   make it that much more terrifying  when vaughn finally relents  hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint  robert shaw  on his decrepit boat  the orca  to search for the shark  the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark  and inevitably  are hunted by it    jaws  is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing  tension  and horror  it is like ten movies all rolled into one  and its no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975  taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time  until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by  star wars    even today  fascination with this film is on par with hitchcocks  psycho   and it never seems to age  although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences  including several mechanical sharks  obsolete  none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill  the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing  characterization  sharp editing  and creative photography  instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects  scheider  dreyfuss  and shaw were known actors at the time  jaws  was made  but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman  nevertheless  this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark  scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing whats right and going against the entire town    its your first summer here  you know   mayor vaughn warns him  dreyfuss  who had previously been seen in  american graffiti   1973  and  the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz   1974  gives a surprisingly mature  complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers  however  most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movies captain ahab  a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards  bordering of parody  shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism  hes slightly deranged  and shaws performance is almost a caricature  however  there is one scene late in the film  when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars  quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u  s  s  indianapolis  a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese  his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1  000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hairraising than anything spielberg put on screen  shaw delivers the story in one long take  and it is the best acting in the film  of course  we cant leave out the shark itself  with its black eyes  endless rows of teeth  and insatiable urge to eat  it is basically the epitome of all mankinds fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature  a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real  having survived sinch the dinosaurs  great whites do exist  they can be as large as the shark in  jaws   and they are a threat  every one of spielbergs subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark  a bunch of writihing  dangling  completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into  the shark in  jaws  was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks  all nicknamed  bruce  by the crew  built to be shot from different angles  many have forgotten  but  jaws  was a sort of precursor to  waterworld   1995   a movies who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb  but  as we can see now  spielberg overcame all the obstacles  and delivered one of the finest primal scarethrillers ever to come out of hollywood  
0	i still cant figure out why people went in droves to see this movie  now before you go assuming im some sort of high brow snob  who cant appreciate a little dumb humor  let me say that i love cheap humor  i thought theres something about mary was one of the funniest films that i have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998  low brow adolescent humor can be a lot of fun  the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow and adolescent  there is no humor component  i wanted to like the waterboy  i really did  i think i only laughed maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire movie  actually  i smiled a couple of more times on top of that  not a great record for a 90minute film  the problem with the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies  those responsible for this mess seem to think that the sheer fact that sandler walks around using a goofy voice and playing dumb the entire movie is a substitute for actual funny material  nothing could be further from the truth  as matter of fact  sandlers idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film  its really a shame too  because this film had the potential to be very funny  i personally believe that sandler is probably a very talented comedian  its just that so far he hasnt been able to find the right film to showcase his talents  if his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons  my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live  most of whom are now happily no longer in the entertainment industry  sandler plays a 31yearold  somewhat mentally challenged  waterboy for a college football team  the teams somewhat mentally disturbed coach  henry winkler  realizes that his waterboy has a great deal of pentup rage  which  if harnessed properly  would make him a force to be reckoned with on the football field  you can figure out the rest from here  sandler joins the team and this once lowly waterboy becomes a football star  as i said  the film had a great deal of potential  the idea was a decent one  but the main potential of this movie is a result of the cast  all of whom are very good  just hamstrung by really  really  lousy material  even sandler  annoying goofy voice and all  has enough charisma and natural comedic ability to overcome some of his bad material  even as unfunny as his character is  i still found myself rooting for him throughout the film  but it is the supporting cast that i feel most badly about  if their material had been just a bit better  this film could have been such a funny movie  fairuza balk plays sandlers leatherwearing bikerchick love interest and does a great job playing sleazy and sexy at the same time  winkler is great as the coach who uses a  coaching for dummies  style book to help him get through games  the real standout though  is kathy bates  even with some of the worst material of her career to deal with  she is still a treat to watch in her role as sandlers overprotective and overbearing mama  even with the performances of bates and winkler  there is absolutely no way i would recommend this movie  although i get the distinct impression that without them  this film would have ranked in negative numbers for me  which is sad  because i cant really put my finger on a particular element of the movie and single it out as the cause of the disaster that it became  its obvious that those involved  specifically the actors  tried very hard to make what they thought was going to be a funny movie  its just too bad that 99 percent of all of the jokes fell flat

0	keep cool  a chinese film directed by semiaccomplished filmmaker yimou zhang  was one of the kickoff films for this years hawaii international film festival  on the day it premiered  lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block  some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater  they need not have wasted their time  the movie is billed as a comedy  but is surprisingly bereft of humor  there are noticeable attempts at laughs  but very few tries actually click  i wondered if there were jokes that i wasnt getting because im not from china  but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldnt be attributed to the cultural barrier either  keep cool just isnt very funny  the prelude to the film was a visit by keep cools producer who  with the help of an interpreter  regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time  an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii  although the print made it  the assistants luggage was lost  too bad that story wasnt in the movie  because it got a big laugh  qu ying  the films female lead  was also on hand to give a few comments  however  whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed  ms  ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one  fastpaced  incredibly long tirade  it was dizzying  good foreshadowing for the film  you see  keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes  at least thats the way it seems  since the camera is constantly moving  cinema verite is one thing  but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another  although some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing  i found it thoroughly distracting  and after a while  quite annoying  headache  as i said  the film is about a young bookseller  wen jiang  who is after a young woman  qu ying   they used to be romantically involved  but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship  the first half of the film is about the young mans plan to win her back  of course the thing is  she doesnt want to be won back  and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit  in the fight  the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker  but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost  we later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced  there is a funny scene  the only one in the film  where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner  baotian li  in order to recoup his losses  there is no sense to be made out of the young womans behavior  cold one minute  caring the next  so we feel no sympathy for her character  the bookseller would be better off without her  although the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well  who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owners hand as revenge for the beating he took  it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man  while the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge  the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation  his quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with  but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time  a friendship develops between the two men  but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate  although only an hour and a half in length  keep cool contains extraneous material  the whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out  since we dont see her from the midpoint on  a case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner  and would have saved us from the booksellers boring pursuit during the first half  but of course  this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour  there are a few things that keep cool does right  as mentioned before  the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good  although it grows tiresome  the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic  and represents the differences in thinking between generations  in one scene  for example  the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across  but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted  and that it means something entirely different  also effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene  such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner  the nightclub owner is counting out money  slapping each bundle of currency on the table  with every shot of his hand  we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge  unfortunately  these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the films shortcomings  and werent enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater  
1	martin scorseses films used to intimidate me  because of his reputation  i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks  as much as i enjoyed them  i usually felt like i missed something  i learned from scorseses casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story  no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies  for example  in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other  there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on  or toward the end  when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building  again  the simple  mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing  i dont mean to say that his techniques are not creative or goodlooking  but he simply uses the best tool for the job  it shouldnt have surprised me  then  that kundun  a film about a mystical religion  actually turned out to be quite straightforward  the movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama  the spiritual and political leader of tibet  the movies title is another name for the dalai lama which means  ocean of wisdom   his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story    one of which makes an interesting statement  pay attention to the films opening shot and watch where it is repeated   we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old  his curiosity and selfassuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama  a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before  several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items  the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own  the boy picks correctly  proving that he is the new  and the old  dalai lama  scorsese and longtime editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk  before selecting an item  he would look at the monk  perhaps for some sort of confirmation  sometimes he picked right the first time  and sometimes he made a second choice  either way  whether through reincarnation or quick human perception  the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise  perceptive leader  from this point on  the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lamas spirit and the future leader of a nation  it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child  in the u  s  it might be grounds for a call to social services  but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage  neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable  wellrounded person  certain patterns take shape over the years  for example  the dalai lama is fascinated by technology  radios  clocks  and telescopes are some of his favorite toys  when he is old enough to accept his leadership  he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet  he also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain  including herd animals  its nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter  but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibets gigantic neighbor  china  tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china  as  first the propaganda  then the political pressure  and finally the armies  come across their common border  the chinese invasion is so successful that the lamas life is in danger if he stays  the movie ends when  after much agonizing  the dalai lama leaves tibet for india  the story doesnt lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do  it just doesnt fit that mold  if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie  perhaps more like seven years in tibet  which is good in its own right   the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that  the structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events  not viceversa  perhaps because the pace is slower  we have more time to notice the beautiful art  vestments  and architecture of tibet  a mandala   tibetan sand painting  with beautiful  vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie  the robes and hats of state are bright red and gold  the bricks are a rich reddish brown  not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans  even the touchstone pictures logo before the movie  which is usually light blue  is the red and gold of tibet  philip glass composed the music for kundun  and he was the perfect choice  for those who dont know of glass  his music is like a tibetan mandala  his building blocks are lots of small notes  tiny grains of music  which are first grouped  then repeated in patterns  these patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition  people wont be flocking to kundun for its great ending  or talking about its outstanding plot  but it does have a lot to offer  an interesting lifetime  exotic sights  rich cinematography  and innovative music  it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person  on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese  who gives the film a strong  beautiful  consistent look

1	what if one of our cities became the target for terror  what can we do  what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism  what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster  so far america has been the leading nation  opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world  it is the land of opportunities  it is the land of freedom  but what if it became the new target  this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality  when a special branch of the united states military  under the command of general william devereaux  bruce willis   takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal  islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice  the only warning the fbi receives is a single  cryptic message   release him   then all hell breaks loose in new york  a bus is destroyed  killing 25 civilians  a broadway theater is bombed  hostages are taken at a school  as the wave of terrorist activity crests  the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law  devereaux argues against that eventuality  but is nevertheless ready to lead 10  000 men into action on american soil  another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard  denzel washington   the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities  his staff is comprised of smart  energetic  intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o  f moronic feds were used to seeing in movies  hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft  annette bening   whose department knows more about the situation than theyre willing to reveal  but the attacks escalate  the fbi are helpless  chasing an invisible enemy  the land is under siege  they have lost control   a terror is coming from within   whats great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life  it reflects reality  and thats why it makes such an impact  edward zwick has created a clever  well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season  the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously  and so his film plays on several levels  never loosing focus on its main objective  he is exploring the abuse of power  the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u  s  government  the army  the fbi  and the cia   he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved  the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii  there are concentration camps and unlawful interments  all in the name of the  greater good   in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul  freedom  was that what the terror  ists really wanted  this film has evoked protests and objections from the arabamerican population in the u  s  and n  y  especially  but to me these protests seem unnecessary  zwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys  the script is therefore wonderfully balanced  agent hubbards best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad  tony shalhoub  is lebaneseamerican  and it is quite often you hear lines such as  my first boyfriend was palestinian  they seduce you with their suffering  or  they love this country as much as we do   but no matter how you twist this matter  you wont get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arabspeaking population who are in the great majority  more to the point  the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arabamericans by the u  s  military  and thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any  way  denzel washington is dashing as always  in this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual  anette bening is enjoyable and believable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage  a network of snitches and seduction to gather information   bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist  hungry for power  that never looses his connection with the audience  since his point of view is not too hard to understand  the film is elegantly shaped  the scenes are easily floating into each other and the film never seems overlong  zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension  horror and emotions and does it with a rarely observed professionalism  he tightens the intensity as the events progress  and when a plot twist comes  it actually is surprising  it is not a film drained in patriotism  like the work of roland emerich  nor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values  it is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky story and difficult journey  it has courage enough to get involved in politics  it questions our foreign policies  mentality and defense  i must admit that it ends rather disappointing  as the director turns the patriotism way up and innovation down  but despite of that  it is certainly an intelligent and thrilling film that provokes emotions and thoughts  a virtue that few summer films can boast of    this is the u  s  army  its a broadsword  not a scalpel  believe me  you do not want us in an american city   gen  william devereaux   the siege  
1	with stars like sigourney weaver   alien  trilogy  and academy award winner holly hunter  the piano  raising arizona  etc   together in a single hollywood production  one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot  sadly for copycat  though tightly scripted and nicely plot  is still at heart  a typical hollywood thriller  helen  weaver   after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer  darryl  harry connick jr    has developed a phobia for being outdoors  so to speak  incidentally  helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers  which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes  a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco  detective monahan  hunter  and getz  mulroney   baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer  seeks the professional help of helen  who  as expected was reluctant at first  copycat  borrows  a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases  it did work  but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability  this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also    much of the time wasted couldve been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama  even so  weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments    weaver being the vulnerable yet strongwithin character  as in aliens  and hunter being the short  tough  texan speaking cop  as in raising arizona   harry connick jr   a very good jazz singer  shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter  which comes to the moment of judgement  drum roll please      copycat is a good thriller  although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show  copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats  in anticipation of the killers next immediate move  this worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts  nice movie to bring your girlfriend to

0	apparantly money talks      and uses quite a bit of obscenities doing so  ive always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity a film can possess  whether in language  violence  sex  or what have you  i find that this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain when a movie goes overboard  and money talks definitely does  its not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly  and i mean constantly    but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way too staged  perhaps if one character were foul mouthed  but in this film  everybody swears nearly every other word  money talks is about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett  played less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker   franklin is your typical conman and ends up with more than one person out to get him  when the plot finally gets underway  theres no less than three people  or groups  that want him  dead or alive  the frenchman whos somewhat responsible for franklins escape from a prisonerpacked bus  a hoodlum whom franklin owes seven grand  and the cops who wrongly suspect him of murder  franklins only hope  james russell  charlie sheen   an investigative reporter for the local news whos out to prove himself a worthy journalist  james offers to help clear franklins name if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report to help channel 12 conquer sweeps week  both of these elements are completely lost along the way however  and never do reappear  as expected  the odd couple of franklin and james do wind up friends at the end  which is another wasted element seeing as how they show no signs of becoming friends at any point along the way  there is just nothing original or intriguing about this film  and so many developments are either nonrelevant  or just plain forgotten about  money talks is a paintbynumbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience  frivilous dialogue  a predictable  flat storyline  and twodimensional characters make money talks a reason to save your money

1	lean  mean  escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by  most are unnecessarily complicated  and others have no sense of expediency  the thrillride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot  perhaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive  which featured none of the flashbang effects of todays market but rather a breadandbutter  textbook example of what a clever script and good direction is all about  the latest tony scott movie  enemy of the state  doesnt make it to that level  its a true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through a maze of cell phones and laptop computers  without looking back  although director scott has made missteps in the past  such as the lame thriller the fan  hes generated a good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide and top gun  that vibrant spirit is present here  shown in welltimed and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed  enemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography  director of photography daniel mindel throws a staggering amount of different views  angles  lenses  and film stocks at the audience that goes a long way toward involving the audience in the movie  enemy is truly a visual experience  and thats only one of the reasons its such a fun watch  the movie lights up with an aging senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds  jon voight   reynolds wants a new communications act passed to allow the government free reign in the use of surveilance equipment  but the senator plans to bury the bill in committee  reynolds has the senator offed  but not before the murder is caught on a naturalists camera  by an extremist chain of events  the tape ends up in labor lawyer robert dean  will smith  s posession  and its not long before hes running from reynolds cronies  its only with the help of an exspook named brill  gene hackman  that dean is able to get to the bottom of things  the acting is top notch  and the three principles  smith  hackman  and voight  are generally more mature and excellent all around  smith puts aside the wisecracking act and becomes a normal human being  voight tones down the amount of sneer he puts into his character for greater ominpotence  and hackman is simply over the top in the mysterioso role  smiths regular joe comes off particularly well  as he runs from authorties for reasons that he knows not  the supports are also in fine form  lending credibility to the main roles and advancing the plot in key areas  this is  for the holiday crowd  the hot ticket  as well as anyone looking for a serving of genuine action in a market that is otherwise lacking

0	forget get carter  instead    get me a cup of coffee  what the hell has happened to all good american action movies  did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere  when did all of the badass  kicking butt and taking names  guntoting  crazed  vengeful characters of the 1980s  from such films as commando  cobra  predator  raw deal  first blood  suddenly turn into innocent  compassionate  sensitive  tearyeyed knuckleheads  the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east  and i dont mean new york city  get carter  the latest masterpiece from uberthespian sylvester stallone  is a prime example of large and in charge 80s action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown  stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up  a few years ago  stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey  that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland  a strange film about redemption within a broken soul  stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past  too bad get carter returns stallone to action  but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges  get carter is a simple story  stallone plays frank carter  a vegas bruiser for a loan shark  played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore   when franks brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident  frank  feeling all guilty and mushy inside  thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented  carters way   he talks tough with his brothers wife  lends a helping had to his brothers daughter doreen  rachel leigh cook   and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee  carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultracool  mcqueenesque mickey rourke  a multimillionaire computer geek  alan cumming   and a strange foreign guy  michael caine  who speaks in riddles and talks tough  carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties  what a minute  this sounds just like another film i saw last year  the limey  better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off  actually  get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name  starring caine in the title role  and what with his cameo here  the cleverness is astonishing   while stallone still carries his own weight here  the movie lacks what the original did as well  purpose  throughout the film  stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough  while nobody is taking him seriously  his oneliners fall flat  and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions  mental and physical  required of his character  there is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations  in both fists and words  the biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke  an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs  spousal abuse  a boxing career  and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way  rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character  he may not win any oscars  but he still ranks highly in my book  get carter has great directing  strong acting by rourke and caine  and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud  the only thing it lacks  as with most hollywood productions  is a good script and proper casting  never mind that it should never have been made at all  
1	seen may 19  1999 at 5 p  m  at the crossgates cinema 18  guilderland  n  y    theater 1  with my brother john for 8  50  theater rating       excellent seats  sound and picture   critics note  this review is the longest ive ever written and still only scratches the surface  id recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis   as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of the phantom menace  how do i even write this review  never mind the fact that ive been waiting for a new star wars movie since i was seven years old  never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released  never mind that theres so much going on in this movie in terms of plot  action  special effects and longterm story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldnt cover everything  and also like ted does in all of his reviews  ill try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you  the reader  before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film  many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered  to get the specifics of the film  skip this and the next four paragraphs   as has been made obvious for the last several years  another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the missing initial three installments of the star wars series  the first of the films was actually episode four  not one   george lucas  the creator of the series  has probably just assumed most people know the firstproduced trilogy  star wars   the empire strikes back and return of the jedi  is actually the second trilogy  chronologically  in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order  but i cant recall his reasons  with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy  err    second trilogy    well you know what i mean   and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which  unfortunately  may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution  critics note 1  it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed  but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule  critics note 2  reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics law of reviewing movies  which as roger ebert coined  its not what a movie is about  but how it is about it   because so many outside factors come into play in the films plot and significance as part of a trilogy  and just considering modern society  it again would be difficult  if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story   first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it  we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker  who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire  we know obiwan ben kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of the force in attempts to become a jedi knight  but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the dark side   we also know something about the force itself  that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it  the jedi   what we dont know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy  which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth  to me  this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle  definite order to all the complexity  also  it seems that were supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended  most notably  details regarding the emperor from empire and jedi   and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine  for those who havent kept up with all the star wars paraphernalia over the years  there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor  or his voice at least   with the phantom menace being the first chapter of a long saga  one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid  including the history behind all the major factors of the series  especially the force and the jedi knights  unfortunately  this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained  i didnt liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness  if youre going to tell a story from the beginning  tell it from the beginning  is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes 1 through 3 to clarify the back story even further    but i digress  ive said so much and yet i havent even touched on the specifics of the film itself  all these necessary disclaiming elements should go to show just how vast the story of the star wars series is and this individual film itself  what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three weve come to know and love since the late 1970s  its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar  but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality  the basic story is rather sorted  complex and even confusing at times  were told that an army known as the trade federation has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo  were not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is  instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly  were introduced to two jedi  the master quigon jinn  neeson  and his apprentice obiwan kenobi  mcgregor   the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planets queen  amidala  portman   the leader of the federation  an alien called viceroy  is following the orders of a strange  mythical character  an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears  he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance  and especially that creepy evil voice of his  he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series  sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person  clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity  which is never openly revealed in the film  but should be clear to most viewers  i have a feeling well delve into his background in the next two films   but it doesnt take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the films story begins to move along  the film doesnt have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one miniplot and adventure on top of another  there are so many of these miniplotswithinplots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook  the other films have relied on this type of storytelling  but because of the limits of the technology at the time  the films screenplays were also limiting  the sense of limitlessness here is what gives the phantom menace its unique traits  as we already know  the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original star wars trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear andor unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story  and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10yearold anakin skywalker  lloyd   by quigon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council  to briefly summarize the story  jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidalas spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation  their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force  jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force  and through another subplot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter  more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves  this also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before  in fact  it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before  the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary  by the films third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot  its funny how the reality of the star wars world seems so embedded in mythology  new agelike philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence  not that this technique hasnt been used in movies and in reallife situations countless times throughout history  and at least its all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter  it does border of the cartoonish sometimes  but thats just the film appealing to our inner child  which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society  the phantom menace delivers exactly what youd expect from a star wars film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness  so many things in the film weve seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited  but this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies  
0	  spice world  is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls  sure theres a hint of humor in there every once in a while  actually  theres a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls  but overall  who cares  not me  if you dont know by now  the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power  yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood  in  spice world  they ride around in their big tour bus  whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews  amazingly  all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things  things they want to do  not things they are required to do to keep earning money  and they keep babbling about  girl power  when they should really be talking about  cleavage power   i mean  if all it takes is girl power  then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits  the film is pg  but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions  youd have yourself one raunchy adult film  by the way  theres something in the opening credits which says  based on an idea by the spice girls   wow  they got idea credit  i certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood    giving credit for simply having the thought  say girls  lets make a movie   the supporting cast fares well  roger moore  the real james bond  mockingly plays the clichespewing  chief  of the spice girls  and darn it all  hes fun to watch  mark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the bands manager  richard e  grant   one question though  george wendt  youd think that  spice world  would envoke one of two reactions in people  if you like the spice girls  youll like them even more afterwards  and if you cant stand them  like me   then  spice world  will really make you sick  oddly  the audience i saw the film with  roughly 50 twelve yearold girls  sat in silence for the entire film  well  not the two who sat directly behind me  they kept muttering  this is stupid  over and over again  maybe there is hope for humanity after all  pg 
1	  love is the devil  is a challenging film  munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot  perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artists psyche rather than the artists lifeline  watching it  i was enthralled with the look of the film  the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre  personalized filter  everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon  the films subject  looked at it personally  but while i was engrossed  i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film  awakened from my trance by some inner distraction  and began to try and follow whats going on  exactly what was i looking at  watching this film  i wasnt sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous  directed  and written  by john maybury   love is the devil  is stylish masterpiece for the senses  everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing  the camera angles are ferociously askew  and the closeups are uncomfortably too close  the editing is deft  occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds  but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs  or rather  intruders to bacons world and psyche  as such  there is no real story  ive not heard much about francis bacon that i didnt read prior to the film  but what i learned was this  he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s  drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like  he was one of the first to really come out of the closet  and in interviews  he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty  as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi  hes like a foppish and selfabsorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero  he lives life the way he wants to live it  to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him  its as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself   champagne for my real friends  and pain for my sham friends   he says one night at the bar he frequents     love is the devil  chronicles the latter part of his life  bacon  wellknown in his midlife  awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor  he walks in  unafraid of what he finds  and discovers a thief  george dyer  daniel craig   bacon gives him an offer  if he spends the night with him  he can take anything he wants in the morning  george agrees to this  and off to bed he goes  but ends up staying with him  for whatever reason  the film shows their lives together  at least in reference to one another  while creating bacons world of friends  like  high art   this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood   the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant  bacon is haughty and bizarre  george is simple and doesnt understand bacon in the least  especially not his paintings  while watching this  thats basically all i thought was there  the film has a hypnotic feel  free of any restraints of form  and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about  once the film is over  its easier to piece it together  i kept on thinking about this film  wondering what the point to all of it was  someone doesnt merely make a film of all style and no substance at all  and if they do  they do it by accident  but still allow some substance to creep in  thinking about it  i remembered how the two fed off of eachother  i thought about how bacon was a masochist  in love with cruelty  in one scene  he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight  and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxers head splashes across his face  in another scene  he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisensteins  battleship potemkin    and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain  he drove him over the edge  and for him that was love  even if it wasnt for george  i guess that explains the title  a bit  thats great and all  but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning  i wish it hadnt reduced itself to making some point about humanity  about how love is the most selfish thing in the world  and it is  if you look at it a certain way   or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one mans twisted pysche  its almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one mans uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audiences throat  that way you dont reduce your film to something its just not  i cant say i totally enjoyed  love is the devil   though  despite all of the things i respect about this movie  its still rather uncomfortable to sit through  even at a normally trite length of ninety minutes  the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through  especially after an exhausting first hour  though hypnotic  it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times  as if it were taking advantage of one mans truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it  as such  i respect the way the film looks  its beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that  along with  what dreams may come  and  dark city   its the years most visually stunning film  in fact  if a better script had been forged  id almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film  complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever  and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi  it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs  i just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance  then i would have had something to hold me over even now  
1	kirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue  all he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow  and you instantly know what hes thinking    detective story  features one of kirk douglass finest performances  he stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night  the film is based on a play  and this is quite evident  as most of the movie takes place in the oneroom flat that the detectives work in  the film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife  but through a series of events  he never quite makes it there  the bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider  a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate  however  this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglass wife  a connection douglas himself is not aware of  many secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film  secrets i would not dream of giving away  with a name like  detective story   one would assume the film would resemble an episode of  nypd blue   but it doesnt quite work out that way  however  we do see douglas at work on a few other cases throughout the running time  lee grant  virtually unrecognizable  plays a meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting  her scenes with bendix  another detective  provide the movie with a few laughs  the performances all around are fantastic  douglas may be the leader of this ensemble  but hes not the center of attention all the time  we get to catch a glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases  which brings me back to douglas  he has a really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him  we can see that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime  but has finally realized that what hes really done is gotten back at his criminal father  how he handles coming to terms with this is something really worth seeing  kirk douglas is the kind of actor we dont seem to see to much of these days  hes a tough guy  but the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior  
1	linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction  and her being cast as dogmas lead is nothing short of inexplicable  shes still in fine form as bethany  an abortion clinic worker whos lost her faith  one night  a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethanys bedroom  he is metatron  alan rickman   the voice of god  and he needs her help  she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey churchthe fate of the universe depends on it  god would do it himherself  but heshe is    missing  having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again  bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the  prophets  jay  jason mewes  and silent bob  kevin smith  doing doubleduty   the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smiths films thus far  at some point  rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus  the undocumented  and very black   thirteenth apostle   and offers his assistance  as does divine stripper serendipity  salma hayek   its a wild ride  theyre in pursuit of loki and bartleby  damon and affleck  respectivelythis is probably the sharpest either has ever been   who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return  loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates  at one point  he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets  its a nasty  guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks   how corrupt are you    wings of desire this aint  since debuting with clerks  smith has grown as a director  particularly in terms of working with actors    chris rock is this films only weak linkbetween jokes  hes wooden   his nofrills visual style hasnt changed much over the years  though  dogmas widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations   nor has his writinghis characters still sit around delivering one caustic  hilarious speech after another  dogma chips away at big religious issuesnamely  the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefseloquently and articulately  but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition  as well  the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever  any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum  hurlyburly  anyone    and eventually dogmas pacing goes slack  a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game  in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings  comes at a point when weve heard enough  because his change of heart  bartleby is initially the good cop to lokis bad  drives the climax  said rant is given a great deal of screen time  sure  affleck deserved a big moment  damon steals their scenes together prior   but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated  like tarantino  smith was a videoage sponge who became a samplemad indie filmmaker  dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies  including indiana jones and the last crusade  with silent bob doing his best harrison ford  and weird sciencea shit demon attacks our heroes  smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour  his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical  a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan  catholicism wow    and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished  i bust  ed   a gut on several occasions  proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever  its a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease  for to read it  one actually has to see dogma  the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christs  martin scorseses 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis controversial novel  in that it is not directly linked to the pictures content but to rumours and heresy  theres a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime  just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against    not one of them had watched it   every single person refused  smith and scorsese have a lot in common  and so do the two films in question  because both smiths bethany and scorseses jesus are hollow shells without their faith  in fact  dogmas denouement  which follows a thrilling showdown thats worth the wait  is a catholic lovein  a veritable recruitment poster    i felt sentimental about a religion i dont belong to  now thats powerful filmmaking   smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god  and that spirituality shines through  its enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins  my religion is movies  when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine  in a roundabout way theyre attacking what i live for  freedom of expression through celluloid  i therefore feel that  although im no biblethumper  im at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers  
1	finding the courage to face life fullon is a difficult task  summoning up the audacity to fall in love is a harder job  if youre a total jerk like melvin udall is  the odds are even more against you  melvin  jack nicholson  is a successful romance author who is just the opposite of what you would expect someone in that profession to be  a solitary man hidden away in his new york apartment with no human interaction and not even a hint of ever having been in a passionate relationship  he avoids the outside world as much as possible  his obsessivecompulsive disorder rules his life as he uses several different bars of soap to wash his hands and refuses to step on a crack on the sidewalk    theres a great scene when he has to cross a floor made of mosaic tiles  verysmall mosaic tiles   melvin has some great lines  when his publishers receptionist asks him how he writes women so well in his books  he responds  i think of men and i take away reason and accountability   dont get him wrong  hes not merely a misogynist  setting his sights higher than that  hes also a homophobe  racist  antisemite  xenophobe  animalhater and intensely dislikes people who talk in metaphors  when we first meet him  hes busy dumping a neighbors dog down the garbage chute  hes an equal opportunity bigot  he does venture outside his apartment every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe  melvin is such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly  helen hunt  is the only one willing to wait on him  and shes none too happy about it  when carol doesnt show up for work  melvins routine is shot and hes determined to do something about it  tracking down her address  he shows up at her place begging her to come back to work so that he can eat breakfast  the fact that shes a poor single mother caring for a chronically ill son doesnt appear to phase him  he wants his food  much more upsetting is that his gay artist neighbor simon bishop  greg kinnear  is brutally attacked during a robbery  this doesnt upset melvin much   dont worry  youll be back on your knees in no time   but when he is bullied into taking care of simons dog  his life is turned topsyturvey  melvin is sequestered because hes afraid of whats out there on the other side of his apartment door  he has to make sure its ritualistically locked three times to keep the world on its proper side  when he brings the dog home he reluctantly grows fond of it  talking to it and taking it everywhere he goes  this little crack in his emotional armor opens him up  hiding behind his need for carol to return to work so she can serve him  he pays for a specialist to treat her son  he even develops a friendship with simon  all three people are heavily damaged  melvin has retreated from life in his apartment  carol has devoted herself to her son  convinced that she has to give up her life for him  simon is estranged from his parents and his friends disappear when he is hospitalized and his money runs out  a more unlikely trio to form relationships  youd rarely see  and in the midst of it all  there are some wonderful moments  melvin is hilarious in his grouchiness and touching as he attempts to be nice    you make me want to be a better man   he tells her  one of the best aspects is that even as he opens up  he is still a curmudgeon  carol  afraid that his monetary contribution to the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain to explain in no uncertain terms that she will never sleep with him  it only takes her a second to realize that she is delivering that statement while looking as if she just left a wet tshirt contest  theres hardly anything left to say about jack nicholson  i dont remember ever seeing him in anything less than a stellar performance and his overtheedge melvin is no disappointment  nicholson may be the best actor working today  hunt does a commendable job matching nicholsons energy  she isnt afraid to be seen as something less than a babe and her portrayal of exhausted rundown carol struggling with seemingly overwhelming obligations is topnotch  their onscreen chemistry is a bit odd  each does a wonderful job with the character  but together  theres something a little off  its a minor problem  they do work well together  but that missing element is what prevents this from being a fourstar film  director james l  brooks   terms of endearment    broadcast news   has a movie that is picking up awards by the bucketsful  nominees for all the top golden globes  winners from the national board of review  inevitable oscars  and has a winner on his hands    as good as it gets  isnt exactly the quality that the title says  but its pretty darn close    michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and as soon as he finishes this one  hes off to an annual 12 night celebration typically held in freezing weather during a snowstorm  this year its in the sixties and raining  that wacky el nino   
1	note  after claiming otherwise  my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branaghs hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap  as it happens  it didnt take long   is there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli  known mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968s romeo and juliet  required viewing for many high schoolers  and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare   he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera  where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria  last year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre  one of the twin peaks  with wuthering heights  of romantic literature  it might seem peculiar  then  that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen  at first blush  hamlet is far removed from romance  the hero  though a prince  is depressed  conflicted and confused  the ostensible love interest gets little screen time  and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery  the plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus  it is zeffirellis genius  however  that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace  in this italian masters hands  romance is everywhere  in a sons worship of his father  in the bonds of deepest friendship  in the private thoughts of young lovers  even in the mystery of castles by the sea  after all  the story hinges on a ghost  and what could be more romantic than that  what seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all  namely  hiring thenreigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead  who could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and a  lethal weapon   in the series of the same name  would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the english language  franco zeffirelli  thats who  and it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money  what gibson brings to the role is a naturalness and ease which makes the whole story meaningful  not to mention comprehensible  his line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed  his movements and gestures  excepting his sometimes too active eyes  are totally in keeping with the character  this is a hamlet whose pain we feel  whose struggle we empathize with  and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at films end  glenn close  the other big name in the production  also does well by the script and satisfies as hamlets mother  gertrude  though i must confess im still trying to understand the character as written    zeffirellis incestuous interpretation of hamlets relationship with his mother doesnt help   alan bates makes a believably evil claudius without resorting to the mannerisms of a hollywood heavy  by and large the rest of the cast performs admirably and comfortably  of special note are the cinematography by david watkin and the score by ennio morricone  both support the realistic mood marvelously  as do the sets and costumes   without any overstated effects that declare  this is important  this is shakespeare   i particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all  the melody of a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due  perhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare  definitive   and there are certainly quite a few other filmed versions of hamlet that i have not seen  but if youve ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of the bard  this hamlet is an excellent place to start  
1	the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made  i know that is very sweeping statement  so ill qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of  science fiction   stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot  2001  a space odyssey is probably a better film  but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science  most all other films we normally classify as science fiction  or sf  are really just fantasy  action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting  the andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a hightech  for 1970  van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town  something bad happens to them  pictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight  apparently everyone in the town is dead  the authorities call a  wildfire alert   summoning four scientists  all but one of them somewhat reluctant  to a supersecret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada  two of scientists  stone and hall  fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks  their blood turned to powder in their veins  some went insane before they died and two of them  a baby and an old wino  are miraculously still alive  they take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab  where stone pressures the white house to call up a  directive 712   an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb  what they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda  an organism that defies all the normal rules of earthlike life and mutates as it grows  their only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict  what they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the abomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet  they barely call off the bombing in time  but then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out  this triggers the labs lastditch defense mechanism  an atomic bomb  to those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days  the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow  much of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts  but what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw  the performances are universally fine  with the actors keeping things lowkey and restrained  just like scientists  to me  the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting  we follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step  puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we dont expect  this film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it  it was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating  mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a bodys wrist is slashed  spilling its powdered blood  
1	jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation  even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited  the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation  this is  after all  the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction  to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood  since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio  desperado  four rooms  and from dusk til dawn  he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide    im willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him   tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films  but never took the directors helm  nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more  tarantino returns with a film he can call his own  the film opens up with an homage to the graduate  with jackie brown  pam grier  on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her  jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo  which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas  this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi  samuel l  jackson  who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico  however  while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u  s  for ordell  jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus  michael bowen  and atf agent ray nicolet  michael keaton   who catch her not only with the money  but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs  jackie didnt know they were in the package with the cash  but thats of no consequence to the authorities  who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted  of course  dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish  ordell  ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry  robert forster  to get jackie out of jail  but while max is immediately attracted to her  jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety  since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police  sure enough  ordell shows up at jackies apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good  but she  borrows  maxs pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell  instead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistols chamber to ordells head  jackie proposes a deal  since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico  jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more  but this time for a more substantial fee  fifteen percent of ordells half million dollars  with a gun in his face  how can ordell not agree  by itself  this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film  however  we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think  jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell  but shes also making a deal with the feds as well as with max  the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham  but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around  instead  its actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of todays movies  at least this film has a little imagination  most of the performances in jackie brown are above par  pam grier  of whom i had never taken notice before  plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable  samuel l  jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control  robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy  trying to do his best   never mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guys apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course  hes just so downtoearth  the nature of his job really doesnt occur to us  even when were shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison  or when we see the tools of his trade  in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara  a recently paroled friend of ordells  and bridget fonda as melanie  one of the girls ordell keeps around town  unfortunately  de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between  and then they are mostly clipped sentences  in this film  hes not really de niro  but stereotypical de niro  uttering things like   little bit   and  pretty much   fonda  on the other hand  plays the slightly spacedout melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness  such that even when she is annoying louis  we are taking her side  as is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand  the dialog is quick and snappy  it grabs our attention and is actually interesting  and in many respects  this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals  the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves  dont count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera  however  theres a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange  and hes not really sure whats happening  but by composing the scene just so  his realization of whats going on is felt simultaneously by the audience  we look at the screen and think   gee  thats clever   and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on  although tarantino isnt afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect  it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film  there are shots where a character is simply driving  and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head  this is a tribute to both direction and acting  however  there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall  and she is looking for something  desperately looking for something  we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search  but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what shes looking for  but instead hoping shell just stop  overall  viewing jackie brown is time spent well  some flap has already been made about the language used in the film  but its really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today  in fact  one might even be able to say that the way in which these  offensive  words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness  go see the film and see what i mean  
0	  return to horror high   wants to be a couple different types of movies at once  the film tells the story of a lowbudget horror movie being filmed at the closeddown crippen high  a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before  but what the cast and crew dont know is that a real killer  maybe the same one that was never apprehended  is going into action again  on one level   return to horror high  is a slasher movie  and it is at this level that it works the best on  watching the film  which was made in 1987  i couldnt help but take notice that the killers costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in   scream   and  scream 2   on another level  the film wants to be a slapstick comedy  and there are many hints of this throughout  unfortunately  most of these jokes fall flat  and the last thing the film wants to be is a  behindthescenes  look at an exploitation film being made  the only problem is that  while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made  no cameras are shown filming it  thus making it far more confusing than it had to be  and to top it all off  the  twist  ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever  and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time  there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous  and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through  if you see the film  or have seen it  youll know what i mean  the premise of  return to horror high   is admittedly pretty crafty  and i liked the atmosphere of the school  which is where the whole thing takes place  but director froehlich  judging from this movie  is an incompetent director  except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene  well  come to think of it  there is only one scene that is actually scary  and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in  but other than that twominute distraction   return to horror high   is certainly no great shake  note  look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film  and strangely enough  he is the first character to get the ax    literally  
0	heres something to chew on  whats the favorite food of big  cheesylooking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising  the obvious answer to this question is cardboard  because thats the depth of the most fully developed character in this painfully generic creature feature  deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer  in fact  considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas  perhaps it was  the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore  not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh  both human and nonhuman  been scattered in all directions  we learn some bloody trivia  as well  such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red  it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains  and what it does with halfdigested leftovers  i suppose deep risings gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre  but it doesnt do much for me  on the surface  and thats about the only level at which this film can be analyzed  deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic  everyone else is citing the equally valid alienstitanic connection  since james cameron directed both   in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongueincheek mayhem of tremors  deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin  the film is not humorous  tense  or exciting  in fact  its downright boring  and  despite being half the length of camerons current boxoffice champ  deep rising feels like the longer movie  is it really necessary to say anything about the plot  probably not  since its easy to guess  but ill go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis  the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship  in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics  theres finnegan  treat williams   the boats pilot  whos supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff  joey  kevin j  oconnor   the inept sidekick whos supposed to be lovable and funny  but is really just irritating   and hanover  wes studi   the  mastermind   and i use that term lightly  of the operation  their goal  attack a cruise ship  clean out the safe  then sink it using some illegallyacquired torpedoes  the problem is  by the time they reach the argonautica  the titaniclike luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste  aside from a beautiful jewel thief  famke janssen  and a couple of crew members  theres no one on board  the reason soon becomes obvious  the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles  the cast  which is led by treat williams  is primarily comprised of hasbeens and probablyneverwillbes  two exceptions  wes studi  best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans  and djimon hounsou  amistads cinque   williams  once a  cant miss  prospect in hollywood  has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising  and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career  famke janssen  who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye  is the perfect bland match for williams  given her limited acting abilities  its likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes  unfortunately  a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet teeshirt for half of the picture  meanwhile  kevin j  oconnor  who has entirely too much screen time  exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard  these days  audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computergenerated special effects  this is a lesson that writerdirector stephen sommers  who previously helmed the liveaction jungle book  needs to learn  the days of jurassic park  when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen  are past  now  moviegoers are looking for the sophistication of titanic  visuals that are so wellincorporated that its impossible to tell where they end and where  reality  begins  in deep rising  the monster  like everything  is artificial and unconvincing  unfortunately  the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isnt so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture  but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre  although  to be fair  deep rising is a particularly bad entry   even once this film has sunk out of sight  the knowledgeable viewer knows it wont be the last of its kind  like the slimy  slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies  more are waiting just around the corner in ambush  and that consideration  unlike anything on screen  is truly horrifying  
1	damn those trailers  had it not been for the advertising of this film  which reveals far too much about its contents  i would have been glued to under the sand  as it is  the film retains some value  thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling  and a more mature francois ozon in the directors chair  marie  charlotte rampling  and her husband jean  bruno cremer  lounge on the beach  she takes a nap while he goes for a swim  when marie wakes up  jean is nowhere to be found  she contacts authorities  but they cant find him either  did he disappear to start a new life  was he killed by accident  did he commit suicide  marie still asks herself these questions a year later  and in order to move on with her life  she must find some answers  its a fine premise  and this little movie uses it to the limit  the film moves at a leisurely pace  a bit slow  but relaxing  its a very visual story  and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles  this is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie  who shot the film in a dreamy haze  and the lead performance by rampling  rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie  you connect with her character instantly  despite that shes delusional  the scenes where she interacts with her husband  who she still believes is alive  are heartbreaking  she cant quite get over him  theyve been married for twentyfive years  the other actors  particularly jacques nolot  are excellent too  the sex in the film is rather unneeded  but compared to ozons criminal lovers  its the disney channel  likely to cause some discussion afterwards  under the sand is a fine movie going experience  while its hard to recommend as entertainment  its a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss  ozon seems to ask what you would do  and thats certainly a hard question to answer  
0	young einstein is embarrassingly lame  but that didnt stop it from becoming a phenomenon in australia  where it became the third largest box office hit of all time  in the u  s   warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan  inxs  and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under  personally  im hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb  young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious  who not only wrote  produced  edited  and directed the film  but also starred and did his own stunts  his creation is about as stupid and contrived as youd expect from someone named yahoo  the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einsteins youth  whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany  the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania  a remote australian island  in addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity  albert invents surfing  bubbles in beer  and the electric guitar  yahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hicka clown with an insatiable curiosity  although yahoos performance is at first endearing  the onedimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say emc2  yahoo has created a charming family for albert  and the scenes on tasmania are often clever  but after the first twenty minutes  the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy  young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot  yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack  unfortunately  the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing  almost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video  the instrumental score  on the other hand  is generally playful  yahoo uses such classics as the  1812 overture  and the theme from the good  the bad and the ugly to great comic effect  halfway through young einstein  i knew for sure the movie was a stinker  but it wasnt until the very end that i finally put my finger on why  the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies  such as young sherlock holmes  but from cheesy primetime sitcoms  in fact  young einstein might have been more at home on network television  where its sophomoric humor wouldnt raise any eyebrows  
1	the happy bastards quick movie review me tarzan    you happy viewer  for a minute there  i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disneys latest  another adaptation of a legend from the past    remember the pathetic pocahontas  yikes   but guess what disney  a company thats been on a roll lately with animated films  strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid in you  the story is pretty basic tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla whos lost her young adopts him into her group  as he matures into a much older man  tarzan still wonders just why hes so much different from the clan  and then arrives a hunter  a professor  and the professors lovely daughter  jane who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons  from there  tarzan faces tough choices should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind in england  the voicework here is pretty toplevel  tony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man  minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the alreadybeautiful jane  nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice  rosie o donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzans best ape friend terk  and wayne  newman  knight has his moments as a panicky elephant  the movie is superb throughout  mixing a great script with incredible computerassisted visuals  when tarzan treesurfs  a twist that was added on top of the same ol vine swinging and a great one  i might add   the camera twists and turns  allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly  i couldnt believe my eyes disney has come a long way since starting in a ballroom for beauty and the beast  and the musics not half bad  either  fortunately  theres no ridiculous singing characters here  just a great set of songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood  theres some great action sequences here as well  including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan  jane  and the aforementioned babboons  but  of course  its not all action theres a message here as well that has to do with family  this is easily one of disneys best animated films of the decade and its one i cant wait to put in my home library    that is  if my vcr still works in the year 2000  
0	perhaps if the impostors didnt have so much going for it  it wouldnt have been such a tremendous disappointment  written  directed  and produced by one of its two stars  stanley tucci  whose last picture was the indie smash hit  big night  the impostors almost never catches fire  sputtering like a twoday old campfire  the story plays like an adlib sketch that was never polished or completed  the films other star  oliver platt  was hilarious as the senators aide in bulworth  the bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent  including woody allen  steve buscemi  hope davis  alfred molina  campbell scott  lili taylor and tony shalhoub  all are wasted save allen  who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes    the audience will easily identify with allens sentiments   with the exception of a single original joke involving mirrorimaged subtitles  the movie engenders little genuine laughter  the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it  the plot for the movie involves two starving actors  maurice  oliver platt  and arthur  stanley tucci   who accidentally end up on a cruise ship  in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor  alfred molina   who is chasing them  they dress up as ships stewards  the overthetop script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer  when the leads hide from their pursuers  arthur covers maurices mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze  at other times  we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else  while darting in and out of staterooms  with the films chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage  it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce  the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having  too bad they werent more concerned with the audiences potential enjoyment  the jokes  frequently framed in silence  fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground  one wonders if anyone ever viewed the films dailies  surely  if they had  they would have realized what leaden results they were producing  it is tricky having good actors play bad ones  but  if they couldnt pull it off  they should have just given up    the show is over for this fella   steve buscemis character says towards the end  the mystery is why they didnt all give up in the beginning  there must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast  the impostors runs 1  42  it is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up  
0	well i guess its that time of the year again  the one time of the year where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even  try  writing a script that has more dialogue than explosions  its also the best time for the handful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies  pull on their black vests and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases  in america they call this time  summer  and it happens once every year  and maybe its the exposure to all that nasty sun that does it  but in the process normally weak  insipid lines like  consider this a divorce    hasta la vista  baby   and  youre the disease  im the cure  actually do end up being repeated more often then the phrases from my book of biblical proverbs  this is not entirely a bad thing  of course  what am i talking about  im talking about the summer  blockbusters   the  action thrillers   the  thisobviouslycostalotsoyouknow everyonesgoingtogo  explosions  gas threats  flying saucers  and special effects  in the rash of  my  what big guns you have  but wait  mine are bigger  movies  there are also the usual boymeetsfishandsavesenvironment movies  or whale  whatever   and  this  year  the odd crop of  savetheworldfromaliensorenvironment threats  offerings  im talking about the three batmans  the speeds  the terminators  etc  this year im talking about twister  independence day  the arrival  the rock  mission  impossible  and of course  eraser  here in singapore  as our local movie critics like to whine  we seem to get the pick of the crop of  my explosion is more reallooking than yours  movies  but nothing else  mission  impossible opened in our theatres almost as soon as it did in the us  the same goes for eraser  which is unfortunate for arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after what time magazine recently called  mission  unavoidable   on account of its worldwide megaadvertising blitz   eraser seems like a cheaper  less thoughtful imitation  thats saying a lot  because mi the movie was already a cheap  thoughtless imitation of its tv originator of the 60s70s  in eraser  arnie is a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their lives in danger  he does this by destroying all evidence of their present existence and resituating them with new identities  his new case is lee cullen  played by vanessa williams who  unlike all the other scumbags hes ever relocated  is  an actual  real life honest person   because shes so good  and has such nice legs  arnold spends the whole movie trying to protect her  and only uses the opening movie sequence to save robert pastorelli from  his  killers  lee obtains evidence that the hightechnology weapons company she works for is secretly selling sophisticated  blackmarket arms to people with foreign accents and stringy hair  of course  as the formula goes  her revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it because heck  there are people in high places who will go down with this  because yes  this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the world  that is  america  since watergate  in protecting lee  arnold is framed by the mentorturnedevil robert deguerin  nicely played by james caan  and ends up having to prove that he isnt the one killing the programmes witnesses in addition to making sure lee isnt accidentally torpedoed to death by the new  green guns his enemies all have  its around this time that people in the theatre with me starting humming the mission  impossible theme  because arnies mission includes breaking into a highsecurity building to run a disk  i guess i should tell you more about the particular gun everyone in this movie is so antsy about  its an electromagnetic pulse gun thing which fires aluminium missiles  and which can see through walls  it has some sort of xray vision  so its user can target the victims heart even from great distances  despite this  which i figure is a pretty cool feature in a gun  though im certainly no expert   however  arnold  whose own heart is targeted a number of times   never  goes flying 10 feet backwards with a twofoot missile through his chest like all the others who get shot by this gun  instead he outruns and outsmarts his trackers each time  giving eery and ironic resonance to that terminator line that practically made him famous   ill be back   like everyone else in the theater  i left the movie feeling that the trailers had duped me  because they made me want to watch this movie voluntarily  although there is a  lot  of violence in this movie  not to mention mutilation and some bloody tussles with alligators  i recommend this movie to most over18s who need some therapeutic mindless action to get over the weirdness of fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas  reviews rating system   wait for the video     a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha      pretty good  bring a friend       amazing  potent stuff        perfection  see it twice  
1	whenever studio executives try to combine the successful formula of two blockbuster films  the end result is always a mess of a script  acting  directing  and generally a waste of time for any audience with an average iq above 40  the latest movie morass from hollywood  the crew  appeared equally destined to fail  a strange combination of grumpy old men and goodfellas tossed together with the likes of richard dreyfuss and burt reynolds helming the ship  the scary thing is that its actually entertaining and a breath of fresh air in this otherwise stale month  the crew works for several reasons  the clever script is reminiscent of an old billy wilder movie  following four  past their prime  wiseguys from jersey who now live in the raj mahal apartment house in miami beach  the wiseguys find themselves being evicted from their  golden paradise  by greedy landlords bent on raising rents for new beach bunnies and boys looking for beachfront property  the four mobsters  bobby bartellemeo  richard dreyfuss   joey  bats  pistella  burt reynolds   mike  the brick  donatelli  dan hedaya   and tony  mouth  donato  seymour cassel  decide to hatch a scheme to plant there a dead body heisted from the morgue in order to drive out the new tenants and keep their home  this  simple plan  suddenly goes screwy  of course  and the boys become involved with a stripper named ferris  jennifer tilly  who wants her stepmother killed  a paranoid latin drug lord whos convinced a mysterious rival is out to get him  and a rat with its tail on fire  the crew works as a strong comedic vehicle driven by a great ensemble cast of talented character actors and subtle leading men  instead of concentrating on bobbys search for his daughter  the film gives equal screen time to all four wiseguys  balancing the production  the acting talents of such screen veterans as dan hedaya  seymour cassel  and the great  great burt reynolds are brought out by each characters uniqueness and synergy within the wiseguy circle  a strong supporting cast including jeremy piven as a philandering boyfriendcoppartner and miguel sandoval as the paranoid drug lord provide the most laughs  the film was produced by barry sonnenfeld and carries a hint get shorty with its energetic camera work by michael dinner  emmy awardwinning director of the wonder years  the quick script written by barry fanaro  screenwriter of kingpin  is carried by plenty of subtly dry humor and wit  the crew is a prime example of how simple and drywitted a comedy can get these days  the great thing is that this comedy does not need to be punctuated by bodily fluids  phallus symbols in the head  or grandmothers giving head in a spa  in the steady flow of  extreme  comedy these days flowing from hollywood like a broken water main  its the elder statesmen like dreyfuss  reynolds  and hedaya that can carry a comic arc with only a few weapons of choice  a decent script and good acting  
1	when i initially set out to review this film  my tag line was going to be  you too can believe whales can fly   then it was going to be  you too can believe pastel triangles can fly   then  it was going to be  you too can believe wood sprites can fly   finally  i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say    theres a lot of flying going on in this film  as our first host steve martin tells us  the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in  well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while  because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released  part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940  grossing somewhere close to 110  000 in its original month of release   subsequent rereleases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved  and rightfully deserved   to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia  disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before  six stories high  in an exclusive four month engagement  from january 1st to april 30th  2000   fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us  after the engagement is over  the film will be shown at regular theaters  is the format effective for the film  with a few exceptions  yes  the first segment we are presented with is set to beethovens fifth symphony  its hard to describe exactly what this segment is about  but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily  everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil  black batlike triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts  eventually  shafts of light from above help drive away the evil batlike things and peace returns to the butterfly things  though this segment isnt very story driven  some of the images are very visually strong  especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things  who are all outlined in blood red colors  begin to overtake the skies  the next segment is set to ottorino respighis  the pines of rome   in this segment  some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape  a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack  he is finally saved  by another liberating shaft of light  and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the  oceans  of clouds  again  visuals are the key with this segment  especially where the whales are involved  reportedly the whales  as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences  are shown as actual size  the cgi whales look incredibly lifelike  except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images  one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent  absolutely beautiful stuff  the third segment  and the least of the eight segments  is set to george gershwins  rhapsody in blue   this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld  and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york  theres a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer  an outofwork sad sack that dreams of having a job  a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm  and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife  i wont go into how everything works out  but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending  unfortunately  the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments  segment four is set to dmitri shostakovichs  piano concerto no  2  and is an animated version of hans christian andersens  the steadfast tin soldier   a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a windup clock ballerina  whom he assumes is also one legged because he cant see her other leg extended out behind her   much to the dismay of an evil jackinthebox jester  the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina  little does the jester know  the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from  the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl  although the ending has been altered from the andersen story   the steadfast tin soldier  is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short  some children may find the jester to be a little frightening  but otherwise the segment is well made  segment five is the funniest of the bunch  set to camille saintsaens  the carnival of the animals   this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yoyo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number  while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia  it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy  segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia  and its the one that people remember most   the sorcerers apprentice   the story is the most recognizable  so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo  unfortunately  the segment wasnt made to be presented on large format film  considering it was shot full frame  and exhibits large amounts of grain  there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain  similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately  but no one seems to notice for some strange reason   an anomaly common to many 18plus screen theaters  segment seven is set to sir edward elgars  pomp and circumstance march no  1  and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character  donald duck  stars  as an assistant to noah  whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark  during the loading  donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didnt make it on the boat  they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners  despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece  it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tearjerkers foisted on audiences these days  powerful stuff  segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich   saving the best for last   set to igor stravinskys  the firebird   an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape  trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation  when the sprite examines the formation  it awakens and becomes the titular firebird  in a stunning spectacle  the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path  including everything that the sprite has worked to create  some amazing animation is present here  and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone  although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film   the host segments are largely  no pun intended  throwaways  although steve martins clip is pretty funny  be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin  penn and teller are usually funny  but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting  the best segment comes from  of all people  bette midler  who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board  pieces like flight of the bumblebee  a take on the four horsemen set to wagners  ride of the valkyries   and a strange segment prepared in the 40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments  for fans of visual stimulation or classical music  fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon  the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material  as i mentioned earlier in the review  if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film  fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters  i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though  then you too can believe that whalestriangle thingssprites can fly  g 
0	the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending  watching one of these movies  everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise  when the film ends  there is a moment of confusion  then recollection  then some more confusion  then possibly a second viewing for clarification  this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more  good surprises make movies fun to watch  then there are the bad twists  you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie  im talking about you reindeer games  or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid  screwed perfectly suits the latter description  what starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on  by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs  larry flynt  scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing  whoops  screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments  norm macdonald stars as willard filmore  a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich  old  insidious boss  miss crock  elaine stritch   when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day  willard is convinced by his best friend rusty  dave chapelle  to kidnap crocks beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars  too excited to pay any attention  the hapless losers plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home  now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends  realizing they can make even more money  decide to stage the fake kidnapping  of course  everything that could go wrong does  the first fortyfive minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment  a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad  but the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear  the more idiotic these characters get  the more reckless the script becomes  at one point  i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters   no  you idiot   im not just talking about willard and rusty  who were extremely annoying  im also talking about the cops in this film  a monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys  headed by murder ones daniel benzali  were just too clueless to forgive  they give real cops bad names  also poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down a role these days  looking almost identical to his penguin in batman  returns  every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief  he just didnt belong in this movie  macdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the film much worse than it already was  gross out humor is certainly not his forte  if youre a fan of norm macdonalds other chaotic comedy  dirty work  you might actually love this nearsequel  otherwise  dont get screwed out of your hardearned money  
0	i never understood what the clich   hell on earth  truly meant until very recently  ive just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying  so horrible  so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as  hell on earth   after all  ive never been to war  ive never been the victim of any violent crime  ive never really been broken hearted  and ive never been audited  so i really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was  hell on earth  then i saw cruel intentions  in a perfect world  i would be in charge of all the movie studios  the very first thing id do in this perfect world  would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with a 20something cast playing teenagers and featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv  and throw them in jail  but it wouldnt just be your average jail  not even a maximum security installation  id have these producers  and everyone else involved in the production of these films  put in front of a war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity  now youre probably thinking to yourself   is this really how bad cruel intentions is   the answer is no  its actually much worse  watching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumbles awfully written script is probably a lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with a chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound  and then pouring acid on the salt  i dont know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum  tara reid  whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet  but the only emotion i felt was sheer boredom  from that opening scene  where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz  to the conclusion which i dont remember because i had practically fallen asleep  cruel intentions is truly  hell on earth   right up there with war and tax audits  
0	tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie  the film  which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states  is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage  and  while its evident that this could be a fascinating live production  the translation to the screen is a creative disaster  enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art  lifeless and tedious  the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium  tectonic plates has a storyline  although the narrative is developed in a decidedly nontraditional fashion  with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences  its not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie  despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious  allbutscreaming   look  art     although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters  because were constantly made aware that were watching a play or a movie  its impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writers ideas  theyre not real  sympathetic  or believable  im willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different  but this particular experiment is not a success  tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine  marie gignac   an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor  jacques  lapage   one day  he disappears  and  fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love  madeleine travels to venice to kill herself  while preparing to commit suicide  she encounters drug addict constance  celine bonnier   who causes madeleine to rethink her decision  meanwhile  jacques has moved to new york city  where he starts crossdressing  calls himself jennifer  and becomes a successful counterculture talkshow host  with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland  supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deafmute  and cultural references that point to chopin  george sand  and jim morrison  tectonic plates is unique  if nothing else  however  as interesting as the film sounds  and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising   it never really delivers  the tone is soporific  the supposedlyintellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting  the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner  although it doesnt take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant   and the symbolism is obvious  tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth  but it takes onehundred minutes to get across this transparent point  there are some worthwhile moments  such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages  although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who arent bilingual   the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because  a  its different   b  its not like anything theyve seen before  and  c  its pretentious  for everyone else  its not only a waste of time  but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage  
1	shakespeare  you hardly understood it in high school  why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesnt count on it  if this is your attitude  then ill say right off the bat that kenneth branaghs hamlet is probably not for you  and you might as well stop reading right now  if  however  you are a lover of the bard  or at the very least are openminded about a challenging script  read on  for there is something rotten in the state of denmark  namely  the king has died  and his widow the queen has wed the kings brother  claudius  but prince hamlet suspects foul play  his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brothers hands  hamlet  enlisting the help of his friend horatio  conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery     and the game is afoot     the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes  with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england  also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers   the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established  interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers  the hamlet castles grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings  mirrorpanel doors  and bridges which connect opposite sides of a secondstory loft  costuming is equally grand  drawing upon both history and imagination   not quite the denmark of the 1600s  the characters attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia  very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel  it is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars  respectively  in addition to directing  kenneth branagh also plays the title character  as the revengedriven royal heir  branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows  from the anticipation of seeing his fathers ghost  to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester  to his eventual wrath  branagh delivers in spades  every scene truly revolves around hamlet  as much a tribute to branaghs acting and directing as to shakespeares manuscript  hamlet seems to be a whos who of shakespeareantrained actors  so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself  julie christie  as hamlets mother gertrude  and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly  as do many of the supporting players  kate winslet as hamlets lover ophelia  does an outstanding job demonstrating the characters plummet to the depths of dispair and madness  richard briers as ophelias father  polonius  and michael moloney as her brother  laertes  are equally convincing  nicholas farrell as hamlets trusted friend horatio  and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the twotiming rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast  hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible  in some cases  this made for interesting scenes  billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick  whom hamlet knew quite well  crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian  and the result is a very funny scene  however  charleton heston  whom many might think would butcher shakespeare  is the biggest surprise of all  as the player king  the leader of a troupe of traveling actors  he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba  part of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story  with sir john gielgud and judi dench   but this is most unfortunate  for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time  his offcamera speaking  while gripping  sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other wellvoiced actor  i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out  and let the venerable actor have the attention  unfortunately  there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions  jack lemmon  an excellent actor  just cant do shakespeare  as marcellus  the guard who sees the elder hamlets ghost  lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him  gerard depardieu  another talented actor  is wasted when given little more than the utterances of  yes  my lord  and  no  my lord  in the role of reynaldo  richard attenborough has a  literally  walkon role  showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador  i think he had two lines  then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway  when i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year  two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was  if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome  well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you  hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one  branagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashbacktype images  this only works about half the time  and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them  you dont have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare  but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly  the alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar  the high school english course  in it  you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the kings english  or i suppose you could just read the cliff notes  
1	note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  be forewarned  floating life  australias firstever submission to the academy of motion picture arts  sciences for consideration in the best foreign language film category  its dialogue is in cantonese  english  and german   marks a special accomplishment by clara law  a compelling  at times poignant film  it manages to maintain its truthfulness while teetering between comedy and melodrama  floating life centers around a hong kong familys sense of dislocation and loss of identity after moving to australia in order to avoid the communist takeover of hong kong  and is divided into clearly defined vignettes  each chapter labelled with title cards pertaining to houses  which serves to emphasize the films theme of family  the film opens with mr  and mrs  chan  edwin pang  cecilia fong sing lee  and their two teen sons  toby wong  toby chan  leaving the bustling  claustrophobic metropolis of hong kong to join their second daughter bing  annie yip  in australia  with their spacious  immaculatelywhite new house and the vast abundance of neighbourhood greenery  the chans initially find this serene new land a strange and wonderous one  and  with neurotic bing cooly remarking about the possible dangers of australian life  killer dogs  poisonous spiders  dangerous ultraviolet rays   a frightening one  this sets up a wonderfully amusing scene early in the film where the four immigrants  aimlessly ambling about their new suburban neighbourhood  are sent scrambling by the yelps of a little white puppy  the tone set up early in the film is broadly comic  and one expects floating life to depict the clash of cultures as the chans struggle to acclimatize themselves to the new ways of australian life as they integrate themselves into australian society  a scene where the two teen sons meet up with a sunbathing neighbourhood girl is left dangling   but the film suddenly veers towards an introspective and melodramatic tone  floating life shifts its focus away from the exploits of the new immigrants and towards bings domineering of her newlyreunited family  setting out a set of stringent and oppressive rules which create tremendous tension within the household and threaten to fracture the family  meanwhile  elder daughter yen  annette shun wah   happily settled in germany with her husband and young daughter  begins to suffer an identity crisis  manifesting itself with her claims to her patiently exasperated husband that their new home is cursed with bad feng shui  and further exacerbated upon hearing of the familial conflict down under  among the dramatic threads of floating life  this is perhaps the most effective and engaging  with an interesting set of characters and a storyline which generates a genuine emotional punch  the one misguided vignette in floating life involves eldest son gar ming  anthony wong   left behind in hong kong to resolve various affairs on behalf of his family and to await his immigration papers before rejoining his parents and brothers in australia  emotionally detatched and aimlessly drifting  his is an uncompelling character  and consequently subsequent attempts to draw out pathos are uninvolving and ineffective  his desperate search for emotional fulfillment is depicted by philosopical droning on the exquisite peak of an orgasm  which quickly becomes tedious  ms  laws film cheerfully embraces melodrama  each of the major vignettes feature excessively emotional climaxes which i couldnt help but find reminiscent to wayne wangs acutely unsubtle the joy luck club  but despite the directors rather clear attempts to tug at the heartstrings  i couldnt help but be touched by a powerful and affecting soliloquy delivered masterfully by cecilia fong sing lee which truly packs an emotional wallop and  in dramatic terms  is certainly the highlight of floating life  floating life at times spreads itself too thin  given the myriad of characters involved  it could either stand to delve into each vignette a little deeper  or narrow its focus to a select group of key characters  however  it is a fine film  with a thoughtful and insightful screenplay by clara law and husband eddie lingching fong  and some superb acting by a cast consisting almost exclusively of nonactors  special note is to be made of cecilia fong sing lee  annette shun wah  and a short but dazzling performance by an actress who portrayed gar mings girlfriend from vancouver   floating life is ultimately about the ties that bond a family together  which are able to withstand great distances and new environments  
0	a movie like mortal kombat  annihilation works  and must be reviewed on  multiple levels  first  theres the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie  but occasionaly  almost as if making an ironic  selfdepreciating remark  the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery  no no    just kidding  had you going there for a moment  didnt i  in all seriousness however  and to be fair to the movie  it  is  necessary to provide two viewpoints  that of a movie watcher unfamiliar  or only marginally familiar  with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon  and that of a fan of the first movie andor a fan of the games  the first movie  mortal kombat  1995   concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth  and its 5 billion inhabitants   the mortals won  and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth  unfortunately  shao khan was a poor loser  and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway  ready to take over the planet  as our heroes assumed a fighting stance  the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those  like myself  who are fans of the game  id even go so far as to say that many folks who didnt know about the game probably enjoyed the movie  the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself  and they didnt try to overachieve  there were a lot of really cool fight scenes  with really cool accompanying music   intersperesed with some distracting  but ultimately nonintrusive  bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot  and  as we know  the movie was a smashing success at the box office  mortal kombat  annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off  with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie  shao khan has decided that hes going to take over the earth  anyways   and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament  thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused  being trite  being silly  and being just plain stupid  one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought  hey  that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a  real  movie now   too bad they didnt simply stick with the formula from the first movie  i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture  but here are the high points    the acting is truly bad  sandra hess  playing the sonya blade character  is particularly execrable  especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage  a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie     in one of the worst pieces of miscasting i think ive  ever  seen  james remar plays raiden  the god of thunder  in the first movie  christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke  a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics  i generally like it when actors are cast against type  tim  tiny  lister  jr  being cast as the president of the u  s  in the fifth element  for example   and remar has always been one of my favorite  utility  actors but hes so totally wrong for this part that he doesnt even have the luxury of amused selfawareness    there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important  but then never seen again    there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks  including a muddled scene where liu kang  robin shou  seeks out nightwolf  litefoot   has a mystical hallucination  and then wanders off with jade  irina pantaeva   for these reasons  and many others   i can only give the movie a 2        unless youre a huge fan of the games andor the first movie  in that case  the following critiques also apply    sandra hess  while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson  who played sonya blade in the first movie   is much more convincing as a fighter  wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer  hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts  and puts together a much more believable fight scene    in the fights  each of the characters does at least  one  thing they do in the game  and often more   sonya does her  kiss of death   jax does his  earthquake   liu kang does his  animality   and so on  a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely    there arent as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first  because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between  silly  silly folks  and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mudwrestling match  lame and so obviously sexist even i  politically incorrect  for the most part  noticed and remarked upon it    the special effects are generally better  except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their  animalities   motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie  for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games  i give this a 5  youll probably like it  but not nearly as much as you liked the first one  
1	its rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year  but that is what disney and pixar animation  s latest film represents  while a bugs life isnt nearly as deep as its predecessor  dreamworks antz  it is just as funny  a bugs life centers  appropriately  around the life of an ant  named flik  flik  cutely voiced by newsradios david foley  hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task  when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost  the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way  the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them  the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper  who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey  when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food  when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission  they never dream he will be successful  they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food  fliks mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return  instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs  who he mistakenly assumes are warriors  when he returns with the warriors  the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes  a bugs life has animation that is simply stunning  the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative  together with the great voice acting  this film is the perfect holiday family film  its main weakness is that it couldnt beat antz to the theaters  making it seem like stale material  
1	jeanluc picard  patrick stewart  and the rest of the crew of the u  s  s  enterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the 1960s series  star trek  gone are kirk  spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek  the next generation  as usual  a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again  this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f  murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonists will  it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists  of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong  so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists  insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films  the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group  in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction  it doesnt do a bad job  other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line  many of the jokes are your typical inside star trekfanonly jokes  while many of the others just fall flat  the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense  there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet  why do they have to be moved  the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f  murray abrahams aliens who number only a couple of dozen  so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion  at least thats plausible  but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen  which makes no sense whatsoever  the other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf  michael dorn   the trusty klingon  worf was on star trek  the next generation  so they want to include him in the films  no problem so far  worf is now a character of star trek  deep space nine  so the writers have to find a way to have him show up  in the last star trek movie  first contact  the included worf in a credible fashion  in this one  the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie  what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you werent hanging on every word on the screen  my minor problems with the movie aside  star trek  insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones  while many of the jokes do miss the mark  many are pretty good  even for nontrekkies  the special effects are among the best for the star trek series  the action is plentiful and well done  this is a very goodlooking movie  it should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek  the next generation that the acting is first rate  it is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade  they interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster  most star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series  if youve always hated star trek  there is nothing here that is going to change your mind  star trek  insurrection is not the best film in the series  but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones  
1	underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today  1998s hope floats was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year  we always get films that make big money at the boxoffice but critics and audiences pan on them  this year double jeopardy is one of those films  critics are calling it predictable and worthless  audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment  but as i viewed double jeopardy i found that it was a great movie  it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart  along with heartpounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is a really good movie  the always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons  a woman with a seemingly normal life  a great loving husband  a beautiful son and a great friend  her husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted  after a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat  her husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck  of course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her  however she isnt immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth twomillion dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money  she pleads notguilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years  while making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad  which makes libbys heart stop right there  she realizes she must get out and prove that he isnt dead  one of her cellmates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she cannot be convicted of it again  which means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it  after she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones  he is a man who has had his share of bad things  while out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband  leading up to some jawdropping twists that are both predictable and not  whatever happens the film was excellent to me  i found the writing wellwritten as well as the acting was great  ashley judd is such a talented and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movie  even if you know what is going to happen in the end  you dont know how  this is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen  except you dont know how they are going to make it happen  it could be one way or another  it could be this way or that way  the movie is highly stylized and extremely wellmade  it gets most of its power from the two leads  ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances  the characters are wellrealized and believable and we feel libbys pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years  even though a lot of critics didnt like the film  i loved it  the director took his time making the movie  and put a lot of shadowing in the movie  i found it not to be boring at all and its only flaw comes from some predictability  it moved at a fast pace  has suspense  humor  heart and great acting  it earns its right to be a great movie and to me thats what it was

carol kane  pam grier  tatyana m  ali  review by  geoff berkshire jawbreaker is the very definition of a  ripoff   this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie  1976   heathers  1989  and clueless  1995  and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich  s  along the way writerdirector darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own  the film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo  judy greer  about the four most popular girls at reagan high  courtney shayne  rose mcgowan  who can basically be summed up as satan in heels  julie freeman  rebecca gayheart  a good girl with the face of a supermodel  marcie fox  julie benz  a dimwitted blonde who demands that people call her  foxy   and liz purr  charlotte roldan  an angel in disguise  liz is everyones favorite because shes both beautiful and kind  liz is about to turn 17 and  as a prank  courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning  in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her  they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtneys car but when they open it later  polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment  their lives will never be the same  poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat  the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at lizs dead body   courtney  thinking fast  decides to pass the death off as a rapemurder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her  things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to  in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into  vylette   hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students  up until about this point the film is effective enough  however  an investigation begins into lizs death and the film becomes excessively dull  the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch  courtneys plan to frame a sleazy guy  marilyn manson  in a brief cameo  is never believable for a second  meanwhile  the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot  julie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack  chad christ   he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid  ferns rise to popularity is equally lame  we do get the best scene in the film  the only one with a spark of originality  during this section  its a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high schools resident jock stud dane  ethan erickson  to demonstrate  using a popsicle  exactly what he would like for her to do to him  it at least provides us with a look at courtneys personality but the way the scene finishes doesnt make any sense  stein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting  william katt and p  j  soles  students in carrie  are lizs distraught parents  jeff conaway  from grease  1978   is julies creepy single dad and carol kane  the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls  1979   camps it up as principal miss sherman  at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinemas greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer  the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look  the costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid  they were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color  director of photography amy vicent  who beautifully lensed eves bayou  1997   does a remarkable job here as well  shot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive  performances are mostly subpar with mcgowan providing only a few good moments  compared with her excellent work in the doom generation  1995  and scream  1996   and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty  none of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actresssinger tatyana ali  who has a small role as a cheerleader  the male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like  auto stud    college stud   and  high school stud 2   the soundtrack is decent and imperial teens catchy  yoo hoo  makes a bigger impression than any other aspect of the film

1	the story of us  a rob reiner film  is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film  as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films  well  1999 has two of them  the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family  american beauty  the story of us  a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family  is a well written  heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience  including myself  cry  the story of us tells the story of ben  bruce willis  and katie  michelle pfeiffer  jordan  and asks the question   can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage   the film is about two individuals who have come together  spent a good chunk of their lives together  and shows when our main characters are  him  and  her   during the bad times   and when they are  us   during the good times   the story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day  ben and katie now only see and live with each other because they dont want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer  or at least say they dont  love each other anymore  ben  a cartoonist  and katie  a crossword puzzle writer  have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage  as they have grown to follow different views on life  family  and marriage  katie is the more organized  sophisticated type  who wants to plan everything out  while ben is a spontaneous  adventurous individual who doesnt mind doing things differently than they were planned  the story of us plays out nicely  as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist  told to the viewer through flashbacks  as the film progresses  it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist  with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage  this method is highly effective  as we see the characters changing from year to year  slowly growing apart  through the flashbacks  we get to see the story of them through both of the characters eyes  and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like  as the story of us has three dimensional  believable main characters  the screenplay  written by jessie nelson  stepmom  and alan zweibel  dragnet   is a touching  down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer  much like another one of nelsons films  stepmom  the script has an open honesty and outlook on life  one that is so realistic  you feel uncomfortable at many times  because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar  as most families these days most go through the hard times  as ben and katie must  if it wasnt for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote  which are rugged and certainly flawed  the story of us would have been this years best picture  bruce willis  a usual actionadventure star  has certainly turned himself around in the past year he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies  to a distinguished  sophisticated actor  as in last summers the sixth sense  and now in the story of us  willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script  although i wouldnt pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan  willis handles himself nicely  and shines in a few of the films most powerful scenes  enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season  where to start about michelle pfeiffer  pfeiffers performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong  as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion  you wonder how  how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism  pfeiffers performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring  will be in the hearts of any viewer that has watched this moving film  the story of us is one of 1999s most real  yet funny films  as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked  superb acting  direction  writing  story  and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film  which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman  make the story of us a touching  unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall  the films major high points are the fights between ben and katie  as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed  and although they also say things like  its over   or  i hate you   you can tell the two still share a deep connection  and that inside  somewhere  they are still an  us   the bottom line  a wonderful  enchanting  and heartbreaking film  one of the most realistic  heartbreaking films in recent years

1	oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with  in a perfect world   a civil action  would be a breath of fresh air  its cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isnt  its romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham bookfilm isnt  and  the capper  it has no distinct ending  and the law in hollywood films is that above all else  you must have an ending  even if its based on a true story  a true story which hasnt yet ended  you must supply an ending  a false one  but an ending nevertheless  hell   a civil action  is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together  and that includes  the firm   the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic   yet its also oddly and slightly unsatisfying  weird  this is  in fact  a steve zallian film  not just the work of a hack  and zallian is the director of the muchadmired  search for bobby fischer   didnt see it  and writer of none other than  schindlers list   in short  i like this guy  and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories  after all  apart from the obvious itsaholocaustfilm and itsaspielbergfilm  isnt  schindlers list  just a damn brilliant film  not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study    a civil action  is the same way  its narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study  and its here that the film seems to go a bit wrong  the main complaint of this film is that while  yes  its an engrossing lawyerly tale  it has no real ending  and thats not necessarily the problem with the film  its that its just kind of unsatisfying  if this were a great film  it would feel complete  and still end basically the same way  but this film just seems to end  and i dont want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on  imagine  if you will  being one of those the film is about  looking forward to this film  and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter  just so the many wont bitch about what is  essentially  genuine  but the fact that it just ends is not  in all actuality  what is wrong with it  its rather that zallian has chosen  in the last half hour  to adandon the traditional lawyer story  and chose the other part of his story  the one about the lawyer  one jan schlictman  john travolta   whos shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer  brilliant because hes manipulative and he always wins  it wishes to make it all about jan in the end  but the truth is  his change  although nicely done  is not full  we see him suffering from a personal crisis  and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart  but in the end  we dont fully believe it  and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision  the film choses an odd angle to go at  a noble one  but one that gives the films conclusion that of incompleteness  in the opening of the film  we see him doing his old schtick  manipulating courts  winning cases effortlessly  and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases  in short  hes full of bullshit and we know it  in the film  he takes a case that is hardly desired  a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river  point one  its not of the usual criteria  jan points out  wickedly  that dead or wounded children arent nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success   point two  it has been through several lawyers  after turning them down  jan changes his mind  a muddled scene  he stops his car on a bridge  looks out    is he feeling a sense of overachievement    and he and his team of lawyers  tony shalhoub  zeljko ivanek  and accountant william h  macy  head out to the town to do battle with the towns company  they spend millions of dollars examining the land  test the water  what have you  this is where stephen fry  a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in  wilde   pops up thanklessly   and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children  and then  unsuccessfully  the workers at the plant  they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company  the eccentric jerome facher  played by robert duvall  more on him later on   as we progress  we get so involved in the way the story is being told  which is engulfing everything around it  including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople  one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland  who lost her child  who begins to have a personal crisis   things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half  as they are up against impossible odds  the judge  john lithgow  is not only a strickler  but a pal of facher  the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify  no concrete evidence is being found  depsite the money spent to find it  and they are quickly running out of money  as macy mortgages everything he can  including their homes and their office  he slowly loses his sanity  his meatiest role since  oh   fargo    and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist  in fact  the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par  owen gleiberman  especially  criticized the film for not being overlydramatic    i suppose like a grisham novel   this wouldnt be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is  instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good  hes seen as being still full of bullshit  because he doesnt take stock in the cares of his partners  and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town  he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out  the final half tries to redeem this  as must have been the point of making this in zallians mind  but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs  and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when hes seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him  and thusly receiving two speeding tickets   we still feel that the big change in his life is that hes not rich and esteemed anymore  the films final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow   the fault is not that there is no closure to the court case  its still going on  you know   but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has  we need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life  and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life  it only feels like half of that  maybe even less  and its not travolta  who does a great job here  though never to be a truly memorable performance of his   but rather zallian  whose final chapter needs a rewrite  up to then  though  its an engrossing drama  one of the best of the year in fact  and one of the best lawyer films  period  the reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted  but rather its about the lawyers  the knights who battle eachother  we learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town  but the reason it cant be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find  and duvalls facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that its almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is  facher is seen as an elderly man  a goofy eccentric  carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it  eating lunches out of paper bags  and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio  and scold anyone who interupts him  but look deeper and you see a master at work  his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him  and its difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way  thats why i liked this film  its hard to put a pointer on  you can never see exactly where this film will land  and even when the credits roll  you still arent sure what to make of it  call it the zallian effect  same thing happened with  schindlers list   not that im comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman   each film is so greatly crafted that you cant help but get involved in its broad storytelling  interesting characters  and  most peculiarly  the wit that comes along with it  if only it felt totally complete  like  say   schindlers list   though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two   it might have been one of the best films of the year  and along with that  a full breath of fresh air

1	i can already feel the hate letters pouring in on this one  folks  i loved the wedding singer  but it gets worse  if i so much as mention titanic in the same sentence      hell  same paragraph as the wedding singer  im bound to be lynched  well lynch me then  because i thought adam sandler and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in recent memory  with titanic as the only exception  right away  youre ready to discount my review  arent you  youre thinking that i cant possibly know what im talking about  after all  this is adam sandler right    well  theres more      i actually got choked up  and more than once  yes  the man who brought us billy madison and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes  but before you shrug me off as an imbecile  i urge you to see the movie and see for yourself  the wedding singer is the story of robby hart  sandler   a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life has been performing cover tunes at wedding receptions for the past five years or so  but when his own wedding results in a noshow for the bride  angela featherstone as linda   robby begins to reexamine his life  and wonder why true love doesnt exist for people like him  in the process of performing at these receptions  robby meets a waitress named julia  played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore  whose reputation is anything but this character  julia too is engaged  and when robby finds himself without a wife  his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding  seeing as how her fiance  the  miami vice  loving glenn  matthew glave   doesnt seem all that interested  as the time goes by  we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding  hes merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup  something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women  its obvious that robby is going to fall for julia and feel a strong need to rescue her  but what is a lighthearted romantic comedy for  this isnt sleepless in seattle  but id actually compare it to that before id compare it to happy gilmore  while the wedding singer maintains some of that postsnl cornball humor  its sincerity and charm carry it a very  very long way  sandler is great in his role  and yes  if you allow it  you can take him seriously  barrymore seems perfect along side him  and although the two more likely represent genx moronism and partygirl ditzism  respectively   the two go together like bread and butter as a mideighties couple  one scene in particular  where julia ponders the future in a mirror  is so well done  i was on the verge of tears  unfortunately  sandler is going to make a lot of people shrug this one off as a nobrainer  but its got so much surprise substance packed inside that im encouraging everyone to go see it  in fact  the entire theater applauded when the film ended  and laughs were so consistent  some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar  the 1985 setting was milked for everything it was worth  and for those of us that are old enough to remember it  it was a bodacious trip back  and done very well   sandler shows a new side to himself while maintaining all his original charm  or is it anticharm    while the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit  grading it on pure enjoyability would give this one four stars  its hilarious  and its touching  its got that great cheezy humor  but it also takes sandler to a higher level than anyone expected  this is one to see again and again  is it possible the wedding singer could be one of the sweetest romantic comedies of 1998  my  magic 8ball  predicts it is certain  
0	vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico  the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow  james woods  is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out  while the initial imagery is a little overdramatic  it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence  that is enough action to last us a while and we could  director john carpenter would let us  get to a story line  but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene  then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that  the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end  and that is something of a pity because the film  based on the book vampire by john steakley  gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery  this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film  but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it  what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires  there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore  anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans  this has not always been carpenters style  his 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the films central science fictional question  jack crow heads a vampire swat team  cleaning up nests of vampires with hightech spears and crossbows  in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek  thomas ian griffith  who has been tipped off to who crow is  now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya  daniel baldwin   to make matters worse  he does not know the people on his own side  tony and his backers  he can trust  meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico  if this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions  thats exactly what it is  the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin  but carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film  show people  dont tell them  just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown  fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding  why are the vampires in new mexicowhat do they want and why do they want it  what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church  how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it  the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized  but instead are revealed through dialog  now if all this was not bad enough  carpenter misuses the james wood persona  woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well  but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergioleone style mythic posturing  while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target  woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero  that is not his style and it just does not work very well  there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses  in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor  one female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair  as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down  one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret  these vampires do not maintain a low profile  there are arguably logical flaws in the film  there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires  it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires  yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight  i suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out  while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale  perhaps i will read the book
