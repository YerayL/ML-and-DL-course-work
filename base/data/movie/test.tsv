1	"weir is wellrespected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subjectmatter into deceptively simple  powerful films  the mosquito coast  utopia  and fearless  posttraumatic stress disorder  among them  
in the truman show  weir essentially breathes life into the nowtired concept of mediamanipulation by tackling the material from the insideout  
it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in topform playing the title character  truman burbank  
by now you must be aware of the premise  unbeknownst to him  truman  carrey  is the star of his own tv series  a 247 peepshow in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations  people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants  
seahaven  his hometown  and the show itself  are the brainchild of christof  harris   who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon  directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras  
for 30 years  truman suspects nothingwe accept the reality were given   poses christofbut a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in fiji  mcelhone  who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement  overwhelms him  
thus  christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact  lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highlyrated program  
in a few broad strokes  weir creates a convincing secondreality  and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost threequarters through  
this allows us to comprehend and accept trumans world before we contextualize it  
for all his madness  christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship  and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it  
truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be  well  so darn nice  like a sibling  or  perhaps more appropriately  a caged animal in an interactive zoo   they want to see him succeed  
the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carreyhe really is an everyman here  abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible  wideeyed bewilderment  
cinematically  the truman show is impeccable  stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images  
as well  it employs wojciech kilars piece  zycie za zycie masterfully and beautifully  
if the film has any flaws  one may find them in laura linneys characterization as meryl  trumans  wife   i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone   and in a subplot involving trumans father  which feels curiously incomplete  
there are a few stupendous sequences  and the film pulls off a wonderful trick  we become trumans audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film  
they wear buttons asking how will it end   
i couldnt wait to know myself  though i didnt exactly want it to end  for this inspired movie is possibly the bestand most complexsummer picture in years

0	"georges polti once wrote a paper called  the thirtysix dramatic situations   in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirtysix different situations  
this may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes   theres nothing new under the sun   
the faculty  the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez  certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion  
theres not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing  
drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers  screenwriter kevin williamson  of scream 2 credit  gives us a horror tale set in middle america  ohio  one eventful fall  
making use of a cast of unusually stock characters  williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence daystyle but rather  through the back door   
parasitic aliens take over the faculty of a rundown high school and soon have infested most of the student body  leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day  
the lack of gusto is the movies major stumbling block  
even though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this  theyve been saved by an energetic approach  
this casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamsons ability  who enjoyed success with the wes cravendirected scream but couldnt pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer  
although he designs the faculty with more of a scifi bent than his typical slasher picture  it still comes down to the same results  throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive  
on that level  the main roles are played by virtual unknowns  
only the recognizeable elijah wood  deep impact  is at the front  other than that  the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers  
perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these upandcomers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved  but to do that  theyd all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la  dawsons creek   
needless to say the acting is far from top notch  nor does necessity ask that it should be  
there is a moment or two of genuine horror  but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the scifi direction to make any use of it  
in sum  the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off  
"
1	"so here is the second of 1999s remakes of classic horror movies  
the first was the dumb  pathetic but ok remake of the classic the haunting  
now comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill  
the classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100  000 to stay in his house  
if they survive the night they get the money  
if not well you get the jurisdiction  
having not yet seen the film  dvd on its way  i wasnt sure if i would really like the remake  
but sure enough it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on  
geoffrey rush  in a fantastic role with an incredible performance  is steven price  the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people  
his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends  
steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list  
somehow someone  or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party  
eddie  taye diggs  an exbaseball player  sarah  ali carter  an exassistant who can rewire anything  melissa  brigette wilson  a talkshow host in sorts  dr  blackburn  peter ghallager   and watson  chris kattan  a smartmouthed humorist in ways  
what he is gonna do is pay these five people 1  000  000 dollars if they can survive through the night  
if they can they get the money  if not well they dont  
the house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum  
years before mental patients broke out and killed the dr  there  forcing him to lock the place up because if he died  so did they  
everyone who was in there burned to death  
now it is steven prices home and he is throwing this party for these five people  
what starts out as a seemingly normal night  turns into a horrifying  blood splattering night  
the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed  
onebyone the people start to disappear  
conspiracies start to turn up  and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all  
the people find rooms  which once held mental patients  
rooms which once had people dying  
rooms which may still contain these people  
now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house  and they must survive each other with terrorfying results  
since i officially havent seen the original i cant say which is better  
i can say however i liked this movie  
geoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price  and does a great job doing a vincent price role  
famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times  
ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs  
chris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines  
peter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims  
the plot was well conceived and was very absorbing  
the movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy  and even sometimes downright scary  
i found even the opening credits to me a little ominous  
one thing i knew not to expect was a haunting type movie with special effects galore  
even though it had fantastic gore and special effects  the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget  which doesns show all the way through but you can tell  
the movie was written well  and its only major flaw is the underdeveloped characters and plot holes that we are left with  
the ending is quite clever and some may not even get it  
i must say house on haunted hill was a surprise  
i was expecting another haunting with special effects  no scares and a dumb ending  
instead i found a good halloween movie with gore  scares and great acting  
house on haunted hill is one of those movies you really cant take seriously  
though it is a wellmade movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws  
but besides that the movie is fun  smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this cant be made all the time  
"
0	"this movie stinks  
although it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances  the plot is so bad it drags the film into the abyss  
i knew i was in for trouble when  during the opening establishment shots  we see a detailed closeup of warrant officer paul brenners  john travolta  military identification card and it is the wrong color  
this might seem like a minor detail  but anyone who has spent anytime with the military knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are yellow  
and what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training  
or what about when brenner tells a suspect that  because he is in the military  he doesnt have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision  
how hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts  
now details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up  but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through  
for example  at the beginning of the film  paul brenner  an undercover army investigator  gets into a gun and knife battle at his offpost houseboat and windsup killing an arms dealer he had been investigating  
the local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing  
but instead of arresting him  or at least take him into custody for further questioning  they release him  
duh  
ultimately  brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and possible rape of the commanding generals daughter  a young captain also assigned to the post  
when brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the generals daughter  does he use them to generate a suspect list and begin grilling suspects  
no  his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing  
eventually  brenner discovers that this murder is related to a violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier  
i wont even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the armys suppression of this horrendous crime  
i will just mention one final flaw  
brenner is investigating a crime that occurred in georgia  
the rape occurred in west point  which is in new york  
he is under a very tight  and totally implausible  36hour deadline to solve this case  
he needs to discuss the rape with a psychiatrist at west point  
does he phone the doctor  
no  he travels  via some unexplained very fast transport  to new york to question the psychiatrist in person  and then he returns to georgia  again by the miracle transport   without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline  
you have been warned  stay away from this one

1	"every once in a while  when an exceptional family film comes along  i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been  with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children  it is remarkable how many nondisney films disappear in a couple of weeks  
now i see that in so doing  i have unfairly ghettoized these films  
so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents  but to anyone who wants to support smart  funny  energetic filmmaking  see matilda  
see it in a theater  rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video  
see the best film i have seen in 1996  
not the best childrens film    the 
best film  
period  
based on a story by roald dahl  it tells of young matilda wormwood  mara wilson   an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents  harry  danny devito   a crooked used car salesman  and zinnia  rhea perlman   a simpleminded bingo addict  
the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists  and when they do  it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books  
when they finally do send her to school  it is to crunchem hall  a bleak place run by cruel  childhating miss agatha trunchbull  pam ferris   
but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher  miss honey  embeth davidtz   who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness  
matilda also discovers another special talent  the ability to move things with her mind  which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbulls cruelty  
it was this springs james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them  and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda  
and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton  matilda soars on the cockeyed direction of danny devito  
devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses  and he contributes some memorable images  
in one scene  an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pigtails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer  later  an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert  
matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale  
it is also characteristic of the best childrens tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost dont realize that they are learning them  
there is a hilarious moment when matildas televisionaddicted father snatches away the book she is reading  in a wicked joke  he thinks moby dick is pornographic  and forces her to watch an inane game show  hosted by jon lovitz  in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around  
matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment  and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child  that because  im big and youre little  im right and youre wrong   
more specifically  it has as its heroine an intelligent  selfconfident girl who struggles successfully against other peoples notions of how she should behave  
it is no coincidence that matilda was cowritten by robin swicord  who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women  
finally  matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment  it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word  
devito knows enough to make matilda fastpaced and appealing to children  taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy  including a great chase through her dark house  
the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable  with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character  
but there are also many  many delights for adults  including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matildas classmates recite in singsong fashion  there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matildas father  
i cant imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted  
matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling  
i will see it again  and years from now i will watch it with my children  
and now i will stop  because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin  and there is a seat in that theater you should be in  if you have a child or ever were a child

1	"copyright 1996 graeme huggan carry on henry is all about henry viii and his eight wives  
sid james plays henry  who no sooner has the film started  is getting rid of his present queen and hopes to find another one soon  
as part of his alliance with france  he requests the handinmarriage to the queen of normandy  joan sims   
she comes to england in the hope of marrying henry but when he finds out that she loves garlic and has a reeking garlic breath  he is totally averse to the idea of marriage  
henrys court is very corrupt  with the cardinal  terry scott  trying to bribe cromwell  kenneth williams  and cromwell trying to bribe the king  
there is a state of crisis when the king puts marie the queen  sims  in the tower of london ready for execution  
the queen is pregnant but she has not liased with the king before  so fingers are pointed at sir roger de lodgerley played by charles hawtrey  who has a rather lecherous character to play this time  
the cardinal and cromwell decide to get a signed confession from sir roger by using all kinds of torture devices  
owing to circumstances  sir roger is sometimes needed to sign that he is the father and sometimes that he isnt  
this is because of renewed threats by the king of france  peter gilmore  to come over himself  which in the end he does  
by then  henry has found himself a new queen  played by none other than barbara windsor  
it looks like he has some explaining to do  
there are standout performances by sid james as henry  joan sims as marie  and terry scott in an unusual role as the cardinal  
also there are cameos from kenneth connor and peter butterworth  who plays barbaras father  
the set and costume design is first class and the overall production of this film is good  
there is even an early appearance from david prowse  who later became the green cross code man and darth vader  
the film does have its downsides though  as it is getting pretty routine for the carryon team to stage historical films and the inventive streak of the script seems to run out pretty quickly  
there is also the absence of hattie jacques and bernard bresslaw  who could have helped the film along  
however  overall the film is funny and there are plenty of laughs and saucy jokes  so that is why i mainly recommend it to carry on fans only  but there is enough humour in the film to make it worth anyones while to sit down and watch it  
"
0	"im not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing  disturbing behavior  with  scream   
maybe its because theyre both horror films  kinda   both have hot young stars  both have an annoying alternative soundtrack  and both are aimed at the teenage crowd  which i guess includes me  
but this is not the next in line with the  scream  flicks as well as the  i know what you did last summer  soon to be flicks  
it owes less to  halloween  and more to kafka and orwell  which  in my book  makes for a more interesting feature  
and it should have been  
this is basically a rehash of  the stepford wives   the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing  as ive been told  with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives  
or something like that  
  behavior   starring katie holmes of  dawsons creek   deals with a bunch of teenagers  deep in angst  who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers  
suckups  
preppies  
it actually  at least to me  sounds like it would work  and with scott rosenberg  that witty penmen who has written stuff like  beautiful girls  and  things to do in denver when youre dead   as well as  con air    it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit  
alas  its not  and it plumets into that little group of movies known as  the movies with potential that blow it   
i remember a film called  white mans burden  which dealt with a reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with its potentially brilliant premise  
heres another one  
it could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves  
its a stage  and this film does in fact realize that  
it gets its message across and it does it effortlessly  
now it just needs to work as a film  
which it doesnt  
its too sloppy and too contrived  
it paints a bleak portrait of high school life    then 
lets it lie  
it brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kissups who do food drives and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes    then 
gives it a cheap twist  when they get horny  they become homicidal  
isnt it scary enough that theyre like this  and cant the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them  not that you could be next to die  
the film introduces us two three different characters who  in the beginning  are considered outsiders because theyre not  yet  part of this clique  the new kid  steve  james marsden  dull dull dull dull   whos having trouble at home because he hasnt gotten over his brothers  ethan embry  in quick flashes so you dont recognize him  i did  suicide  the renegade girl  rachel  katie holmes  from  dawsons creek    whos chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring  and by far the most interesting kid  gavin  nick stahl  the kid from  the man without a face    whos the most interesting because hes the only character whos given some dimension  
in the films best scene  he introduces steve to every single clique  nailing each ones fetishes and hangups  and its the best scene in the movie because its witty  satirical  and interesting  something the rest of this film isnt  
gavin suspects theres something awry with the preppie kids  known as the blue ribbons  and in the tradition of all conspirators  and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve  hes only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff  
here  we have another case of  the idiot plot   where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him  but he may have saved this film from being the dreary  dull film that it is without gavin  who gives it life and humor  
the only other halfinteresting character is the school janitor  played by william sadler as a retarded  scary guy who may not be what he seems to be    but 
really  we dont care anyway  
i probably shouldnt mention that this was directed by david nutter  whos works for  the xfiles   because that would probably tarnish his reputation  
like the show  hes good at setting up weird conspiracies  and creating a general creepy feel  
most of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect  and some of it works  
but what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff  
he keeps too much inside  so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act  you wonder why they just dont get the hell out of there  
i think what happens to gavin is proof enough that theres something rotten in the state of teen angstdom  
what this film needs to be is a lot longer  a lot more colorful  and a lot creepier  
if the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor  played by bruce greenwood  an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent  who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed  then they need to come up with a tougher  smarter villain  
if hes so villainous  then why could two dense teenagers who couldnt figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes  
the film  which runs about 80 or so minutes  just needs to work on these things  and become a lot less sloppy  
at such a short running time and with such lame  boring characters as these  its pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in ones mouth  especially mine

0	"this wellconceived but ultra sugary comingofage film is not for everyone  and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion  
joseph cross  joshua beal  is a 10yearold who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather  loggia  to bone marrow cancer  
loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner  it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup  
the beals are like a sitcom idyllic family  where everyone is just so nice and affluent  and properly religious without being fanatical  
the beals  the father  denis leary  and his wife  dana delany   are both successful doctors  julia stiles plays joshuas older sister  needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him  
this is a family seemingly conceived in heaven  but living in south philadelphia  sending their children to a wellrun catholic school  
joshua  the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn  is a handsome  sweet  intelligent  friendly  and endearing child  who does well in school  relates to the nuns and priests  and talks politely to his wellmeaning parents  
all this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch  
the plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather  who promised to be with him forever  
his answer is to search for god  pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do  but thats just the way it is  sometimes  
this search for god takes us nowhere because  as his friend david  reifsnyder  says  where can you look for him if he doesnt exist  
now  thats a smart kid  
but joseph looks for him in the usual places  and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends  
one of his teachers is the kindhearted sister terry  rosie odonnell   who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball  making him the cleanup hitter  and in my opinion  if she wasnt a big tv star  would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher  she is that convincing  
throughout the film  she is saved from answering any tough  sic   
question about god by the bell  as it rings to end the class  
nothing much happens in the search for god  there is no parody of the catholic school  though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god  but this is gentle stuff  no real criticism or search for god is attempted  
what comes next into play is some hollywood hokum  which is designed not to upset anyone  as joseph has a reassuring encounter with a real  live angel  a blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goodygoody  
the film ends as this angel      
tells him his grandfather is all right  
his quest is ended  as apparently angels dont have wings and are approachable  and god  well     
maybe thats for another film down the road  
this part of the film was the final straw for me  i couldnt swallow any more goo  
as this film flopped commercially  his next one  the sixth sense  pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose  
though if you look through the cleverness of both scripts  this director is loaded with hokum  all he has learned how to do  is hide the hokum better  
well  god bless him  if he can do that  
this is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood  
its just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death  children in a parochial elementary school  or for that matter  about god  
and that family of his  theyre too good for words  
yet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place  
for those who want to see something soft  without a bite to it  this is the one

1	"for more than a decade  anjelica huston has been one of americas finest actresses  
in her directorial debut  bastard out of carolina  based upon dorothy allisons largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south  huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well  
the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright  nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth  in postworld war ii south carolina  
through voiceover  narration done by laura dern   we find that she nearly didnt survive birth  as her single mother anney  played by jennifer jason leigh  was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident  
thats just the beginning of her troubles  
bone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate  a social stigma which her mother and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come  
anney meets and weds lyle  a kind man and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automobile accident  
anneys brother earle  played by michael rooker  introduces her to glen  played by ron eldard  a coworker at the mill  
glen  the black sheep of a wealthy family   when are you gonna make your daddy proud  
ill tell you when  never   
hes told  and filled with bitterness  courts anney and eventually wins her  despite warnings of a violent temper  
when anney miscarries with his muchprized baby boy  glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone  beating and abusing her  while the lovedependent anney tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour  
things turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment  
while set several decades ago  this story remains completely relevant in todays society  where abused wives return to their husbands  and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other  
the real star of this domestic drama is not topbilled jennifer jason leigh  but child actress jena malone  who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance  
her work is of awardcalibre  and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged  kirsten dunst  tina majorino  anna paquin  natalie portman  christina ricci  elijah wood   malones performance stands up well  
leighs performance in bastard out of carolina is fine  although shes not really given much to do  and ron eldard work is very solid  skillfully manouvering his characters moods in and out of explosive rage  
one can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressurecooker ticking away  
of the supporting cast  special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rookers performance  
theres a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste  from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms  to the familiar sight of a driedup uptight wise old granny  played by grace zabriskie  sitting on the porch rocking chair  to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance  
still  it cannot be denied that anne merediths screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power  
hustons direction of the film is surehanded and impressive  giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast  particularly the young malone  
her sequences of child abuse are shot in a hardhitting emotional  rather than graphic  manner  and are very effective  
hustons talent with camera positioning is wonderful  from a visually striking shot done through a fan  to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile  
the film has the toneddown feel of a television production  bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station  who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience  
perhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant  but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing

0	"by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer  its possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one  
action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup  
audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the films sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending  which is an insulting copout  
somewhere out there  maybe theres a small cadre of filmgoers who will appreciate spheres dubious charms  but im not among them  
i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie  i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham   because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by  its hard to understand why the rights were optioned  
sphere is the kind of first class mess that only a topline director with an alist cast can create  
with expectations high  and how could they not be  considering that another barry levinsondustin hoffman collaboration  the excellent wag the dog  is still playing in theaters    
something this bad cant help but look even worse  
the last time a bigname  bigbudget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last years batman  robin  and everyone knows how that movie was received  
sphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james camerons the abyss  but  somewhere along the way  it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort  event horizon  
science and philosophy  which are used to good effect during spheres first hour  give way to mindless  confusing action sequences  
attempts at characterization fall apart  
intelligent writing  which is evident early on  is replaced by hackneyed drivel  
special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness  
but all that is just in preparation for the ending  which is inexcusably awful  
this is the timehonored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect  
i left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film  
there is some promise  but its all in the setup  
were introduced to norman goodman  dustin hoffman   a psychologist who once wrote a 35  000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered  
when one is found in the middle of nowhere  1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean  norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee  
on the team with him are beth halperin  sharon stone   a biochemist who was once his student and lover  harry adams  samuel l  jackson   a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18  ted fielding  liev schreiber   an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology  and harold barnes  peter coyote   the government operative in charge of the mission  
together  the five descend into the bowels of the ocean  where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact  
for a while  sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the manmeetsalien situation  
the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists  such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship  apparently from the future  offer intriguing possibilities  
then  right around the onehour mark  thats the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatevers left of titanic   the virtually nonstop action begins  and  once it starts  the script becomes superfluous  
this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension  but  instead  he relies on loud  overbearing music  strange camera angles  and quick cuts to make things  exciting   
additionally  because none of the characters are wellformed  a common failing in anything penned by crichton  whos more interested in technology than people   viewers dont develop much of a rooting interest  
it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience  
what about that alist cast  
not surprisingly  the most energetic performance is given by samuel l  jackson  but his harry isnt a person  hes a walking plot device spouting occasionallywitty dialogue  
dustin hoffman isnt lively or particularly good  its ironic that this  which may be his worst work in a decade  has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination  for wag the dog   
sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat  
their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion  automatons would have been as effective  
then theres queen latifa  who  despite getting fifth billing in the credits  ahead of liev schreiber  who boasts at least quadruple her screen time   has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count  
i like to think that levinson and hoffman  recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be  chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance  the lowbudget picture was filmed during spheres lengthy preproduction phase   
if thats the case  forgiveness is granted  
im less inclined to look favorably upon crichton  although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume  jurassic park and the levinsondirected disclosure come to mind   
even if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process  crichtons credit as a producer disallows him absolution  
he was a willing participant in a creative travesty  
no wonder sphere is being released in february  in the midst of the early years cinematic wasteland  
it deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic  which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninthconsecutive weekend atop the box office heap

1	"i dont box with kid gloves  
i dont play nice  im not a nice guy  and i never  ever  go easy on a film  
i consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic  
however  i do some favors  and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery  
rigormortis  the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking  gets several of these points each time  
i still  however  will not go easy on them  
they recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy  which begins  quite wittily  with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film   and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it  
in the famous lines of many martyrs  i have no regrets  
well  i do have some regrets  but that is not the point in the previous sentence  
the point of it was that down with america was a film that  from a critical standpoint  did not entirely disappoint me  
sure  the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain  and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films  but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable  
down with america concerns a government agent  needless murder  and a book containing everything from the unabombers manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report  
like the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed  it displays an offkilter humor and intelligence  it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail  
the best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s  
a dying movement from the day they started  these paranoid thrillers had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word  roswell   
in down with america  the line roswell is highly absent  
with an about ten minute running time  down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich  that the conspiracy films fell into  makes jokes at them at the same time  and provides us with funny and memorable characters  
again  i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldnt care less about  
the film  as previously stated  concerns a federal agent  peter roach   an obsessed librarian  meri stevens   a mystery man  joe kaczkowski   and two people obsessed with silence in the library  robb sherman  kevin flowers   
the plot  a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in  a public library where it can be viewed by all  
from there we go into a delightful parody  
the federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth  the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books  
we spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast  
although the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to noname  it ends up being the noname people who do a good job  delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out  
for once  i dont have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online  
i can only say that you should find my previous reviews of lauto and les xfiles and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself  
its almost as much fun as the film

1	"ingredients  lost parrot trying to get home  friends 
synopsis  a russian janitor named misha  tony shalhoub  discovers a little old parrot languishing in the basement of a science research facility  
  paulie the talking parrot   the voice of jay mohr  soon regales misha with his life story  
as a young bird paulie is raised by marie  hallie kate eisenberg   a little girl with a speech impediment  
by attending maries speech lessons  paulie learns to actspeak like a regular person  
unfortunately  after being unfairly blamed for an accident  paulie is taken to a pawn shop and sold  
paulies biggest wish is to return to marie  
many years later  and after a succession of memorable owners  gena rowlands  cheech marin  and jay mohr   paulie falls in with a bad crowd and is apprehended in los angeles trying to steal jewelry  
he is sent to a cruel research facility  where he refuses to participate and is imprisoned the basement  
will misha help paulie get back to marie  
opinion  every time people watch movies that portray animals as beings with cute human personalities  some wellmeaning audience members go out next christmas or birthday and buy a dalmatian or whatever creature is currently popular  
soon enough   birthday kid  loses interest and the purchased pup ends up at the local pound  a victim of neglect  
my sister owns a real paulie  it thinks like a parrot  bites like a parrot  and requires as much attention as a newborn human infant  
please think twice before buying one  
okay  back to the story  
in movies  parrots usually play support characters  but paulie might be the first movie where the  animatronic  bird gets main billing  
paulie  like those side characters in disney cartoons  is cute and sassy  a strutting  miniature human  
actually  paulie is the voice of jay mohr  he played jennifer anistons boyfriend on picture perfect  doing his best buddy hackett impression  which is interesting  since hackett himself cameos as the pawn shop owner  and mohr doubles as a customer   
paulie is for kids  
while watching paulie you hear little tykes in the theater laughing hysterically when paulie calls the cat a  stupid furball   
sometimes  however  there are statements the kids dont get  
for example  when paulies elderly owner ivy  gena rowlands  dies  paulie explains   well  one day  the cat got her   
and you hear kids exclaim   what cat    
imagine lassie come home  except with a dollsized human dressed as a bird  and youll have a good idea of the plot and characterization  
bird tries to get home  
bird meets elderly friend  
bird loses elderly friend  
bird meets eccentric friend  
bird loses eccentric friend  
bird meets bad influence  
and so on and so forth  with paulie meeting friends and saying goodbye at a meandering pace until he finally makes it back to marie  trini alvarado   
the bottom line  
break out the popcorn money  moms and dads  
paulie may be the low end version of lassie  bambi  or babe  but hell do  
sometimes the wisecracks go over their heads  but im sure youngsters can appreciate a story about a little person  paulie  trying to get home  meeting friends and experiencing moral lessons on the way  
and good luck explaining what it means when paulie says of ivy   well  one day  the cat got her

1	"in these days of overlong movies  meet joe black  the thin red line  the mask of zorro  it is a shame that films like waking ned devine cant be longer than a paltry 90 minutes  
this is just a cute movie  even through its mildly risque subject matter  
old friends jackie  bannen  and michael  kelley  try to find the lottery winner  they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60  so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings  
through process of elimination  they find that it must be lovable old ned devine  who they find sitting in front of his tv  clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand  
what results is thuroughly amusing  as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong  and that they could really benefit  
after all  old ned wont miss it  
rather than divulge the later twists and turns  ill stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage  
bannen and kelly are a perfect pair  
one slightly stout  the other as thin as a rail  
both getting on in years  they make such a cute pair of old codgers  
waking ned devine may even be seen as a  full monty  for the geriatric set  especially since kelly gets buffo for one amusing scene  
waking ned devine is by no means perfect  but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films  
the performances by everyone in the town are great  particularly the two leads  
there is one twist at the end which i find unnecessary  but it hardly ruins the picture  
writerdirector kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters  
scripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm  not the exception  
perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more  
had i held off on my years bestworst list for another day  waking ned devine  officially released in late november of 98  surely would have graced the short group of the years finest films  
it is light  but thought provoking and sweet  
i cant think of anyone who shouldnt see  or wouldnt enjoy  this film

0	"its almost amusing to watch 21year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potters followup to 1997s the tango lesson  the man who cried  
the geny actress  with her cold stare and big  black eyes  has appeared in an impressive range of films  but she doesnt even come close to being the bold heroine the film  set against the historical backdrop of world war 2  requires her to be  
ricci  whose character is shockingly silent and blank  showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern  shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett  quite an amusing sight to behold  
blanchetts lola  a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie  is bold  interesting and layered  everything our heroine lacks  
costar of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy  blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci  sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe  
the actress inhabits the role  as she always so remarkably does  with a fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the films lead rather than her dull companion  
important historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film  these landmarks serve as the films little conflict  
obviously  the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events  whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues  
the man who cried has many aspirations  none of which come full circle by the films close  
there are forced messages here and there   go forward  always go forward   lola preaches to suzie  theres romance between suzie and a fellow target of hitlers nazis  the gypsy cesar  johnny depp  who  like ricci  barely gets to speak   lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it  and at the core of all these devices lies suzies desire to travel to america  where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago  
the films main problem is that potter isnt skilled enough to tell the epicsized story of suzie  
the time periods instability  the conflicting social classes  the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life  serving as both writer and director  potter throws in some of each  but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any  
by the time the sighinducing climax hits  the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater  
the films falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely  are we really meant to believe any of this could happen  
contrastingly  in its moving final scene  the man who cried strikes a note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film  
although its apparent that potter cant grasp what she reaches  im puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place  
riccis suzie is meant to be the films core  from the extended flashback at the films beginning to the quickly drawn ending  everything seen in the film  in some way  relates to her  
so why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals  
the character of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble  but not present enough for the film to be riccis  
the almost constant lack of flow and onenote tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha viernys beautiful cinematography that renders the films various locations wonderfully  
also worthy of note are lindy hemmings costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely  
and then theres the music  
from minute one to minute ninetyseven  theres hardly a moment when the wavering  skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music dont undercut the action  the notes stricken both overwhelm  particularly john turturro  portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio  whose money and reputation catch lolas interest  and accompany  oftentimes  the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the films characters and reinforce that state   
potter obviously cares much about each and every musical note  unfortunately  the same effort isnt given towards  almost  everything else

0	"forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects  
set in 1692 at salem  massachusetts  the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon  
they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells  
then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes  
not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor  daniel day lewis   abigail  winona ryder  suddenly seizes a chicken  beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood  
taking even adolescent hormone surges into account  surely this chickenbashing bit is a bit excessive  especially for prim puritan sensibilities  
surely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets  
the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur millers name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play  
this is far from a harmless event  a bad start to an already shaky morality tale  
the play describes the films opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply  and this adds to the plays charged atmosphere  
in the film  the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandoras box  
not only is credulity stretched but abigails obsession is unfortunately spotlighted  
it positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts  it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot  
not surprisingly  the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning  witches are invoked by those eager to blame  
when the girls are questioned  their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses  led lustfully by abigail  
with alarming synchronicity our hormonallyadvantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents  constant reminders that abigails passion sets all this into inexorable motion  
abigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctors love  his wife elizabeth  joan allen   by including her among those accused of witchcraft  
appropriately narrowwaisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile  watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow   day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an overearnestness that longs to be watched  
director nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis foamingmouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration  
otherwise  hytners direction is unremarkable  
ryders performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings  
her fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful  
abigail supposedly revels in her newfound power  but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here  
paul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth  but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves  
probably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing  allens elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character  
a scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed  
unfortunately  when johns audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost  
it is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions  
his screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message  
the result is a clumsy muddle  i felt like the chicken from the opening scene  head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavyhanded to be wholly believable  
when the gallows beckoned  it was sweet release indeed  
far from bewitching  the crucible tests the patience

0	"a movie laced with a good blend of action  comedy  and a heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet  but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way  creating a dismal and unsatisfactory product  
eighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters  blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed  minus half of its original duo  the late john belushi  and nearly all of its original charm  
dan aykroyd reprises his role  as well as his cowriting credit  as elwood blues  the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a selfproclaimed  mission from god  along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago  
as we begin  elwood is being released from a state penitentiary along with the news of his brothers death in prison years ago  
completely on his own  elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood  only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away  
but elwood isnt completely without family  
it seems he has a halfbrother of sorts  not a real brother mind you  just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudofather curtis  cab calloway from the first film   who has also passed on  
despite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata  kathleen freeman  to do otherwise  elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an effort to start up an all new blues brothers band  
working as a police commander  cabel chamberlain  joe morton   has an immediate disliking for elwood  who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mothers affair years ago and then goes on to steal his wallet  
following elwood around is the lonely orphan buster  j  
evan bonifant   who quickly learns to become a minielwood  
when bartender mighty mack mcteer  john goodman  joins the group  the blues brothers band is complete  and once again  the group travels the country  crashing cars  blowing things up  and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock  
meanwhile  cabs personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his nexttonextofkin  
from this point  the movie turns into a series of music videos with a few bits of acting in between  
those hoping for an interesting andor funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story  
only the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours  
for those people  it may be worth it  for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting  but when the story does intrude upon the festivities  the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes  musicians turned stiff actors  and the pointless 10year old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing  
appearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin  james brown  eric clapton  and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film  but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors  
blues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really  really love this kind of music  you might kind of  sort of like this movie  
many  many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny  and if you dont have a passion for very deep bluesrock  youll be bored out of your skull  
much of this film seems nothing more than aykroyds selfserving vanity project  but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this  none of the excitement is passed on to the audience  
and seeing three guys in threepiece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces can only be funny for so long  
unfortunately  those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the film

1	"a thriller set in modern day seattle  that marked marky marks migration from the  good vibrations  and  calvin klein undie ad  guy  to mark wahlberg  thespianatlarge  and a mighty good one at that  
plot  boy  wahlberg  meets girl  witherspoon   
boy likes girl  
girl likes boy  
boy and girl begin dating  
parents of girl arent crazy about the boy  
girl steps to boys defense  
family problems occur  
girl learns more about the boy  
boy goes nuts  
fun ensues  
critique  ever wonder what would happen if your better half turned out to be someone other than the person that you had come to cherish and love  
well  if you ever have  then this film is definitely for you  
it isnt the most original premise in the world  but it is handled pretty well here  and pretty quickly for that matter  a speedy 90 minutes   
i think one of the main reasons this film worked for me is the groundbreaking performance by mark wahlberg  of boogie nights infamy  7  510   
he completely captured all the goodness  and badness  of the main character of this film  and always kept me wanting to see more and more of him  his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience  as  best villain  at the 1997 mtv movie awards   
the soundtrack is also very effective in this setting  and of course  the slutty performance by alyssa milano is something we could all indulge in  look for the nice bikini and butt shots    if 
youre into that kind of thing  that is    
i didnt much care for the fatherdavid relationship which seemed to be a little too contrived  but for the most part  i was really into this movie  
then again  daddy dearest did have one of the coolest lines in the movie when his wife is asking him what the  big deal  was about his daughter dating david  
his reply   the big deal is that the guy gives me the creeps  and the girl is my daughter   
good point  
all in all  the movie kicked some fun ass  mindless as it was  and effectively demonstrated every parents worst nightmare  
mind you  i still cant tell if reese witherspoon is good looking or a douchebag  but hey  life goes on  
and on a personal note  we finally decided to add some taco meat onto our nacho fiesta of usual  and let me tell you all    it was a flaming success   
another firm recommendation by joe schmoe  
little known facts  director james foley was the man responsible for the critically acclaimed glengarry glenross  810  back in 1992  at close range  7  510  in 1986  and even directed an episode of twin peaks in 1990  
mark wahlberg stands 5  9  is born in massachusetts  dropped out of highschool  later got his ged   and was convicted of several minor felonies before starting his career as the lead singer of marky mark and the funky bunch  
his brother is donnie wahlberg of new kids on the block fame  
he is also testing the waters on the acting front

1	"whats shocking about  carlitos way  is how good it is  
having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacinos previous film   scent of a woman   and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one  he had just won an oscar    carlitos way  was destined for underrated heaven  
thats what it is  an underrated gem of a movie  
and what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it  and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study  
  carlitos way  deals with  well  carlito brigante  pacino   a puerto rican exdrug kingpin  who gets out of a long jailterm when his cokeaddicted  curlyhaired lawyer  sean penn  points out a legal technicality  
of course  carlito was actually awoken in prison  and has decided to go straight  even if hes really a crook at heart  
carlito  like barry lyndon  is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn  and cant escape into something he is not  
carlitos attempts at a clean  legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn  
when he first gets out  a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shootout  where he has to kill a couple people to survive  
hes constantly getting bugged by the government to see if hes doing anything illegal  and his lawyer finds himself neckdeep in a pile of shit  needing him to try and help him out  which includes him doing some prison breaking  
carlito  like ratso rizzo  wants to go to miami  since  according to film logic  thats where its at   but needs some funding  
being a legend  he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club  this is the 70s  by the way  and since some of this takes place in night clubs  we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics  including several k  c  
and the sunshine band tunes  my personal favorite   
he gets a bodyguard  the great luis guzman  at his best   and is soon running a pretty good business  even if hes constantly attracting underworld young thugs  like benny blanco  from the bronx   john leguiziamo   who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito  
on the other side  the symbol of promise and hope  is gail  penelope ann miller  what happened to her    his girlfriend from before prison  
shes a goregeous ballerina  and a stripper  and soon carlito is trying to get back with her  and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami  
while this relationship is never fully defined or anything  we get a sense of love between them  and they have some truly interesting scenes between them  she never gives him addresses or locales  he always has to track her down   
all of these elements clash together at the end  in a brilliantly executed  emotional climax  which is inevitable  
when i say inevitable  i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack  putting a great spin on it  
sure  its going to eleveate some of the tension  but it gives the film a lot of depth  as carlito is seen trapped by fate  
whats amazing is the big chase sequence  amazingly done by de palma  has a lot of tension and thrills  
like  apollo 13   we know whats going to happen  but were still thrilled by what happens in the middle  
its also very emotional  thanks to a great script by david koepp  and amazing performances by pacino and miller  
de palma is famous  or infamous  for lots of violence in his films  
his earlier flim   scarface   which starred pacino in the lead   has a ton of it  especially at the end  and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which im still not over   
but de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes  
to me  the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building  looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet  
this is the most brilliantly done  and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film  and probably the best in de palma film history  
with a gorgeous soprano duet in the background  and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlitos head  and a saddened  remorseful look on pacinos face  its a tearjerker  well  for me  i dunno about you      
the acting from all is great  especially from the three leads  
pacino was panned for his performance  chiefly because his accent wasnt puerto rican enough and  well  it wasnt as  strong  as his oscarwinning role in  scent of a woman   
well  his  scent of a woman  performance was great and all  but it was nothing really but  as comic kevin pollack said  a  foghorn leghorn impression   
in  carlitos way   hes emotional  and strong  despite the fact that hes remorseful over his entire lifestyle  which he cannot change  
i felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tangodancing  insultthrowing blind guy in  scent of a woman   
as i said  penelope ann miller is great  and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry  
and theyre scenes are wellwritten  with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship  
and sean penn is amazing as the cokeaddicted rat attorney  
every scene hes in  he has great energy  and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino  
in smaller roles  john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great  
  carlitos way  is one of those films which you heard about briefly  but when you finally watch it  youre absolutely blown away  
its a wonderful film  a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didnt do so hot  
but trust me and check it out  
its a great little film  and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right  
"
0	"to watch battlefield earth is to wallow in misery  
it is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history  
it has a clumsily told story  insipid dialogue  shallow characterizations  ugly scene transitions  no evidence of dramatic arc  headacheinducing sound effects  and a resolution that is completely implausible  
worse  theres the promise of a sequel  
why   
save your money  
some films go quickly to video  
this one  however  should go straight to the scifi channels mystery science theatre   
in the year 3000  man has become an endangered species  
most of humanity  called  mananimals  was destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race of plundering aliens  called psychlos   
survivors have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved to mine earths resources for the rest of their lives  
the aliens are a menacing looking humanoid species that stand ninefeet tall  who resemble inbred klingons  
dimwitted as they are tall  their culture is predicated on power  extortion  and getting  leverage   
travolta  the leverageusing star  plays terl  the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth  
much of the movie is spent showing us examples of terls petty machinations  
he routinely employs deception and then punctuates his statements with maniacal laughter  
but one thing is certain  he hates being stationed on earth  
when the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet  he begins to devise his latest plan  
he will select a group of slaves to secretly mine out a gold ore site  
its not clear how this benefits terl  except that it makes him richer in a place where he has no use for it  
the scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler  barry peppers  is selected as the slave groups leader  
a psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining knowhow  
but the machine also teaches him other things such as the psychlo language  the principles of our founding fathers  euclidean geometry  and the location of fort knox  
this enlightenment just doesnt prepare him for the mining assignment  
it also prepares him to organize and stage a massive revolt against their captors  
were going to blow up their home world   he says  
but first  we need a few more supplies   
in days  he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling  loincloth wearing  rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts  
by now  the audience is laughing as maniacally as terl  
the media have been working overtime to let the public know that john travoltas labor of love is a piece of scifi drivel  
numerous journals have called it an illconceived idea stemming from blind hubris  arrogance  and poor planning  
and after watching this movie  youll wholeheartedly agree  
this is a terrible film that is illogically constructed  tediously acted  and frequently begs the question  why was this ever made  
at a price tag of 90 million  this film will be remembered as a gigantic folly  assuredly becoming the avengers of this summer  
both films were unforgivable and this promises to suffer the same speedy fate and subsequent indignity  
in addition to the universally pejorative reviews  theres another bizarre element to the battlefield saga  
this film would never have been made if not for the star power of travolta  who for over a decade  had been trying to persuade studios to bring the story to the big screen  
the controversy is that travolta is a scientologist  and battlefield is based on a 1982 novel by l  ron hubbard  the religions late founder  
this led some to believe that battlefield earth would amount to scientologist dogma  laden with subliminal messages  
but the story is so poorly told that any message  subliminal or otherwise  is totally undetectable  
if the audience got anything out of this film  it was this  we are not too unlike the psychlo leader  
like terl  the audience felt imprisoned  dreaded their situation  and looked for any opportunity to leave  
could that be the scientology message

1	"synopsis  as a response to accusations of sexual prejudice in the armed forces  a female naval intelligence officer is chosen to be a test case  
if she can survive the demanding s  e  a  l  
training  she will open the way for other women to be permitted to follow in her footsteps  
throw in a lot of political machinations  sabotage  brutality  water and sand and you have an entertaining movie  
review  the title of this movie turned me off at first  
i mean gi jane        
the other titles which were considered were more promising  in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been acceptable although navy cross or undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as im concerned  
i went into this movie not liking the title and being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor  
to my surprise i really enjoyed the movie  
moore as lieutenant jordan oneil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty woman in a few good men  
the storyline is simple  
anne bancroft playing senator lillian dehaven is a ruthless  machiavellian politician with an agenda to push  
using feminism to achieve political mileage  she forces the military powers that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s  e  a  l  
training  
jordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all  looks  brains and strength  
the training is gruelling and the indignity almost painful to watch  
nonetheless  its one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out and encourage the hapless heroheroine along in hisher endeavours  
sure  there are the stereotypical elements  inhuman treatment  sexual innuendo  resentful peers  pained boyfriend and sexist commanding officer  
stepping away from the stereotypes though  viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than a brutal screamer  
his character exercises a little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such a character  
jordans boyfriend royce is also in the military  
although they both started at the same time  due to the fact that he has seen active service  he has advanced through the ranks much more quickly than she has  
royce  what is his surname  
do we care   
almost resents jordans attempts to advance herself  although he quickly settles down to being doeeyed and supportive  
his character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that you dont have to be a lesbian to want to be in the military  
in parts  this is a very silly movie  with gratuitous lines and scenes thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that its hard not to cringe  
i still liked it though  
weaknesses in the script aside  this is a film which captures a heroic and reckless mood  
as we watch jordans battle  its increasingly clear that it is a personal battle  
this is an individuals fight for selfadvancement  
we dont have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings  we dont have to feel uncomfortable because were having ideology thrust down our throats  
its enough that we can sit back and hope that this one person gets what she wants and we can admire her tenacity and determination without coming out and saying whether we believe women should go into combat or not  
"
1	"towards the middle of  the sweet hereafter   a crowded school bus skids on an icy road surface as it rounds a bend  careens through the steel guard rail  and disappears out of sight  
then  in long shot  we see the vehicle slowly sliding across what looks like a snowcovered field  
it pauses for a moment before the  field  cracks under the bus weight and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment  a single smooth second of time  
compare that scene  if you will  to the last eighty minutes of  titanic   when the behemoth sinks slowly and spectacularly to its watery demise  and youll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films  
the scene in  the sweet hereafter  epitomizes all thats right with independent canadian director atom egoyans film  
its not sensational  
we dont see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming  terrified children being bloodied and battered about  
the bus doesnt explode or break into a thousand tiny pieces  
it simply leaves the road and silently slips beneath the surface of a frozen lake  
its a horrifying sequence made all the more so by calm and distance  
using a nonlinear approach to his narrative  egoyan shifts back and forward in time  connecting us with the inhabitants of the small british columbian town who have been severely affected by this tragedy  
fourteen children died in the accident  leaving their parents and the town itself paralyzed with grief  
the catalyst at the center of the film is ambulance chaser mitchell stephens  a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm   who comes to sam dent to persuade the townsfolk to engage in a class action suit  
stephens  who  doesnt believe in accidents   functions as a concerned  involved observer  scribbling details in his notebook and providing the parents with an opportunity to reach some kind of closure in the harrowing aftermath  
while stephens initial drive may be financial  one third of the total settlement if he wins   his involvement provides him more with an outlet to come to grips with his own loss  
his selfdestructive  drugaddicted daughter has been in and out of clinics  halfway houses and detox units for years  
egoyans attention to detail and ability to establish mood are so impeccable that even the sound of a kettle boiling resonates like a plaintive cry  
mychael danna  who composed the shimmering music for  the ice storm   contributes another memorable score that shivers and tingles  
equally impressive is paul sarossys cinematography  capturing the imposing canadian mountainsides and lowhanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy interiorsin one scene a bright wall calendar serves to illuminate portions of a room  
  the sweet hereafter   while undeniably grim  urges the viewer to grab onto life with both hands and not let go  
its a film of generous subtlety and emotion  
"
1	"roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton  
this italian film star  best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther  has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust  
but benignis life is beautiful  la vita e bella  is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love  devotion and sacrifice  
the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benignis guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore  
like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him  most notably the almostforgotten harry langdon  benignis guido has a childlike innocence  
he ignores the growing antisemitism of the fascist government  
instead  guido ardently falls in love and persues dora  a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official  
in benignis tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate  yet slapstick  encounter  
guido wins dora  
they marry  
fast forward about five years  
guido  dora  and their 5yearold son  giosue   giorgio cantarini  are a happy family  
guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore  
but racial and antisemitic tensions are on the rise in italy  and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities  
the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp  
here  guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son  but to keep him from being exterminated  
it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched  
for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror  the pain  the unimaginable suffering of a schindlers list  
true  many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over  and most were not sent to the death camps  but to work camps where they were used as slave labor  
unlike steven spielberg  benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust  
his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child  
for guido  to save his son  transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game  
giosue  must follow the rules without question to amass 1  000 points  
the winner takes home a tank  
therefore  guido tells him  he must remain hidden in the barracks  
he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him  
guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates  
guido  lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners  instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive  
throughout their imprisonment  guidos quick thinking continually keeps his son from harms way  
ultimately  the allies rescue the camp  
in a poignant scene  giosue  comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound  
the boy goes wideeyed with wonderment and delight  thinking he has won the game  
the price for his victory is most high  
benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell  a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness  
life is beautiful is a fantasy  a fable  
it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust  
those who object to it are missing its point  
and that is simply where there is hope  where there is life and where there is love  the spark of humanity will never be extinguished  
committed to lifelong learning through effective communication

1	"confession time  i have never  ever seen gone with the wind  
i dont know why  really  
havent wanted to check it out on video  havent been at home the nights it was on network tv  and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the bigscreen  
so right up front  ill admit that i dont know what the heck im talking about  but here goes    
is titanic the gone with the wind of the 1990s  
maybe thats going a little bit too far  
as good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie  theyre no clark gable and vivien leigh  
but    
the parallels are there  
gwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available  technicolor  
titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors  
gwtw places americas greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story  titanic does the same with the atlantics most legendary tragedy  
they both have strongwilled redheaded heroines  they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slavessteerage bums  they were both incredibly expensive and popular    
ok  maybe thats not enough parallels  
so titanics not in gwtws league  
no matter  
titanic is a great movie in its own right  complete with spills  thrills and  especially  chills  
much has been made of the humongous cost of the production  and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again  
the money was obviously wellspent  
the costumes look great  the sets look great  the cgi graphics look great  
i especially liked the expensive little touches  like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks  
but writerdirectorproducer james camerons real challenge in writingdirecting producing titanic wasnt just costuming and set design and special effects  
camerons major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in  
he succeeds masterfully  
cameron does two things that work incredibly well  
first  he shows us modernday salvage operations on titanic  thats just  titanic   not  the titanic   mind you   
the first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state  corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic  from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett  bill paxton   
television coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101yearold rose calvert  gloria stuart   who survived the wreck in 1912  
stuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role  narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew  
secondly  cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character  and the romantic triangle between rose  winslet   her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley  billy zane  and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon  dicaprio   
the way that bigbudget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an allstar cast  so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people  
cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack  while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board  
the supporting cast is professional  but mostly anonymous  other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown  theres no moment when you stop and say  oh  yeah  i know him  whats he been in  
  although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform  or even as the illfated engineer   
the love story itself is rather conventional  
i think some reviewers found it weak  and that may be a fair criticism  
the performances are the key here  
zane has the meatiest part in the movie  and he plays the arrogant  condescending steel millionaire to the hilt  
hes smooth  he looks great in a tuxedo  and hes a convincing enough jerk that the winsletdicaprio relationship looks plausible  
at the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat  you can hear the wheels in his mind turning  saying not  can i save this little girl    
but  can she help me get on a lifeboat   
dicaprio is a revelation  
i hadnt seen him before in anything  and didnt know what the heck to expect  really  
  honestly  i expected a bad irish accent  but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea  so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game   
dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive  and being on the titanic  that its hard not to like him  
from the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg  dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest  and he never falters  
winslets character grows up a lot during the movie  and so does her performance  
at first  shes not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look dropdead gorgeous  
we know from the narration that shes monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane  but there isnt any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio  
winslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg  
its at that moment where winslets character really comes alive  
faced with real danger  she drops her spoiledrichgirl mannerisms and does a splendid job  
as rose and jack race around the doomed ship  looking for shelter from the freezing water and cals fiery temper  winslet turns in a superb acting performance  mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror  
of course  the most interesting character is the ship itself  
cameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic  and shows her in every mood  as a deserted wreck  down in the boiler room  up on the bridge  down in the hold  at the captains table  down in steerage  and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead  
camerons greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well  
"
0	"the last line  or near to that honor  is the great butler  alfred  the ubergod  michael gough  saying   i think we need a bigger bat cave   or something to that note  
thats exactly what this film is  too big for its own good because it has too damn much  
cut batgirl out  
cut one of the villains  
its too much to handle in one dosage  
its so much that characters get left behind  
poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way  shape or form  
and elle deserves better  
this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher  
its also the fourth worst in the series  and second worst from joel   
the series has been declining since its stunning debut  followed by the almostasstunning sequel and then the anticlimactic third one  first by joel   
this ones not anticlimactic  i knew it was gonna suck  
its up to joel to make it fun though  
  batman forever  was fun  
this is a big bore of overproduced action sequences and shallow characters  
i mean  this one bit  
im gonna put all the plot in one paragraph  mr  freeze  ahnold   whos wife was dying of some disease  has become the new big villain these days  
hes a huge exscientist who fell into some weird liquid  hello  
joker   and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body  
batman  george  and robin  chris  fight him a bit but find theyre growing apart  
meanwhile  another villain shows up  poison ivy  uma    who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist  john glover  who kills her when she finds out hes used her research to develop an uberman  bane  who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had  
she emerges from her chemicals  dont ask cause i cant tell ya  as a sexy woman  the real uma  whos poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people  
she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo  
meanwhile  alfreds dying of the same disease mr  freezes wife has  but in an earlier state than she   and his niece  barbara  alicia   comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade  but soon  well  not really soon  it takes her 2 hours  becomes batgirl  
meanwhile  in an unfinished subplot  bruce  batmans alterego  if you forgot  has been dating the lovely julie madison  the even lovlier elle macpherson  who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing  
end of her for all we know  
mr  freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population  dont ask      
the trio must team together  as family  to beat them  
there ya go  
not the whole story but no big context clues  
too much  right  
right  
the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels  
however  while tim burton nicely balanced the villainbatman storyline  although not wonderfully   joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one  
he gets some corny speeches  a couple clever lines and thats it  
maybe some stunts  
for all this  i cant even comment on george clooney as batman  i hardly saw the guy  
and when i did  he had horrible dialogue to say  
i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode  
george is in between them  
hes not quintessential  hes not horrible  hes good  
but im sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since theyll be critically murdered for this sorry effort  well get a good script and clooney will shine  if he still has the job   
the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher  
last time  we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brainscomedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey  
this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain  the same guy   mr  freeze  
we feel bad for his mentalphysical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants  
arnold isnt very good  too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points  
when he watches old movies of his wife  he actually looks somber  
wow  
but uma makes the most of her seductive character  getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness  
its like shes almost parodying herself in  pulp fiction  at points  
shes incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better  
as for the lower batpeople  chris is the same as he was in  batman forever   although i think his work in these is too hokey when hes best at quieter parts in  scent of a woman  or just plain cool parts in  fried green tomotoes   
alicia  i love the girl but shes not particularly good in this film  
she can hypotheitically act  we all saw that in  clueless   but her lines kinda sound weird  
and it isnt the mushymouth this time  
but in all fairness  she has virtually no part  
joel gets around to her occasionally and when shes on  she does stupid stuff    although 
i know im not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma    
and poor elle  
poor  poor elle  
i love that woman and she can also hypothetically act  for those of us who saw  sirens    
but she has no part    
it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product  
there are no  couch  scenes  like my best friend noticed   
now listen to me on this one  in every  batman  flick  theres a couch scene  
in the original  it was with vicki  
in  returns   it was a good makeout scene with selena  
and in the last one  it was a chat with nicole  
this one  its nothing  
and batgirl does nexttonothing in this film till the end when shes suddenly  part of the family   
fortunately  we get a lot of alfred  
hes the always reliable butler  in case you didnt know  who has been with bruce all his life  
hes a god  
hes a father figure  
hes also dying  
this got to me  
i love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe  not in his tux  and freaking dying just gets to me  
we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time    but 
this is never answered  as this film is too cluttered  
but in defense  it does have some good parts  other than uma  
for one  george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do  
and there are some nice touches  
when they show the asylum at one point  they show the patients belongings in a room and we see the riddlers costume  
i laughed  
and during a biker scene  involving robin and batgirl  another subplot never handled past initiation period   we not only see coolio but a bunch of badasses dressed as  droogs  from  a clockwork orange   
i laughed at all these  
the film falls apart around the fiveminute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes    or 
did it just feel like that  
the film should serve as another in the longline of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays  
people are fed up with stupid films  
thats why the word of mouth killed  the lost world   
thats why last year  indy films grossed more than ever  
thats why this will have a strong boxoffice initative from people who just want to see it  like me  but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it  
thats why the next two bigbudget aciton pics are john woos  faceoff  and barry sonnenfelds  men in black   both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on  
i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste  
i like some of his films   flatliners    a time to kill   but a lot of them suck  
hes a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and thats what makes him great  
but his costuming for woody allens  sleeper  was more interesting than this one  and his costuming was cool  look for the nazi number   
i love the  batman  series  
the first two rocked and i did like the last one  
but this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three  
hopefully  this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time  
and maybe theyll get smart and bring back catwoman  
and michael keaton  
but we can only hope  
"
1	"for the first reel of girls town  you just cant get over lili taylor  
is it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student  
harder still  can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part  
with the sure  showy expertise of a de niro  taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuckyou confidence she can muster  
its a deeply felt  deadon performance  and by the halfway point youve forgiven taylor her own maturity  
for all its verite pretenses  girls town is less about a bunch of highschoolers than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writerperformers examining their own feelings about rape  relationships  and american womanhood  
the movies opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smartsassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation  patti  angela  bruklin harris   emma  anna grace   and nikki  aunjanue ellis   
but about 10 minutes into the film  we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life  
the remaining girls manage to smug nikkis diary out of her grieving mothers home  and page through it at pattis place  investigating the root of nikkis despair  
what they find is cruel and galvanizing  nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned  and was privately questioning the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen  
shellshocked by the truth of the matter  the three girls begin to talk among themselves and come to a realization about their own lives  
emma says she was raped last year on a date with a football player  
pattis barely sympathetic  wondering what the hell emma thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jocks car  
and anyway  pattis had her own share of guys who wouldnt take no for an answer  
pained  acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow more and more angry  angry about the impossibility of saying no  and angry with themselves for being weak  for being naive  for putting up with it  
  why do we put up with it   
emma finally asks  once the argument has reached a fever pitch  
  we try to talk about it  and look what happens  
we fight for 20 minutes   
theres the admirable crux of this picture  
girls town is a political film  in that it calls for action  
but its incompleteits never quite sure how to justify that action  or what form it should take  
the trio become crusaders for their right to dignity  and its surely one of this years most stirring movie moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passengerside window of that damn jocks car  doing the right thing    
they hang out in the bathroom  chatting incessantly and scrawling slogans and naming names on the door to a toilet stall  
  subvert the patriarchy   emma writes  and then starts a hall of shame list underneath that other students begin to contribute to  
the girls silence their hecklers  take revenge on the deadbeat father of pattis child  and eventually come facetoface with nikkis tormentor  
still  the movie has a desperately unfinished quality  and none of these subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying  
  you keep waiting for someone to call the cops on these brazen girls  but nobody thinks of it   
perhaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at hand  the film borrows its epigraphs from audre lorde and queen latifah   who you callin a bitch     
the points are well taken  but they should have been unnecessary  
long on characterization but a little short on story  girls town is less than it could have been  and too selfcongratulatory for my own taste  
director jim mckay is best known as a consort of r  e  m  s 
michael stipe  he directed the nearly unwatchable tourfilm for that band   and girls town is his first foray into feature filmmaking  
the movie was created and scripted by committee  but mckay and his lead performers had to shoot on a shoestring when  predictably  the group couldnt secure funding  
then again  girls town on a budget would hardly be the same film  
the movies slapdash quality is key to its significance  
truth be told  all three of the leads look too wise for high school  but thats ok  theres a onceremoved quality to their fine  spontaneous performances  as the women take a very skillful look back at the girls they once were  the girls they wish they had been  or some combination  
for all its flaws  this one gets extra points for having its uncertain head and heart in the same noble place

1	"all those who were offended by theres something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie  a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch  
and while this uproariously funny  grossout summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste  it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end  
american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenagetargeted fare this season  
i must question the studio that releases a movie like this  
the producers are aiming these films at the 1524 crowd  but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an rrated film  
some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc17  a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie  
american pie was threatened with an nc17  but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product  it was given an r  but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park  
it is sick  perverse  and ultimately disgusting  not to mention extremely funny  
american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night  
jim  jason biggs   kevin  thomas ian nicholas   oz  chris klein  and finch  eddie kaye thomas  are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead  
jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base  to which one of his friends replies  like warm apple pie      
of course  this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers  in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner  
there are many moments  such as this  in which director paul weitz uses a gameplan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary  to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief  
american pie is a hardfought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it  
i loved the young cast in this movie  
consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with  obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects  and you should appreciate their performances  
biggs is more than enjoyable  and chris klein  who recently played a similar jock in election  is obviously a young talent on the rise  
but in a teendominated movie  the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy  of televisions sctv   who is unexpectedly brilliant as jims uneasy father  
scenes in which the familiar fatherson conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie  
after levy discovers jims new use for apple pie  he tells him  i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age  
but i never used baked goods   
it is performances such as his  and bill murrays in rushmore  that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out  
there are some lessthanoriginal aspects of the film  
a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of exlax is something weve seen before  
if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers  then this is a decidedly unwise move  the same prank was pulled in the brothers dumb and dumber  and used to greater effect  
secondly  the characters are forced into a halfhearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing  
but at one point  in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of its own  biggs asks his buddies why hes going through so much pressure for something thats not very important anyway   
and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate  it still manages to be mature  
in its own way

0	"dr  alan grant  sam neill   jurassic park   is becoming disillusioned  
paleontology is no longer the sexy science it once was since the ingen corporation cloned his subject matter  
his lectures bring people interested in his adventures on isla nubla rather than his research and funding dollars are drying up  
when the kirbys  william h  macy   fargo   tea leoni   the family man   ask him to be their guide for an anniversary flyover of isla sorna  the notorious site b of  the lost world   hes disdainful  but once they wave their checkbook  he reconsiders  
however the kirbys havent given dr  grant their real agenda in  jurassic park iii   
of course  we  the audience  have been tipped off  given that the film begins by showing us eric  trevor morgan   the patriot    a young boy  and ben  mark harelik   election   going for a paragliding adventure off that same island that goes awry  and looks like cheesy rear projection   
grants established back home with a new right hand man  billy brennan  alessandro nivola   loves labours lost   on site at a dig in montana sorely lacking funds  
he also pays a visit to old flame dr  ellie sattler  laura dern   jurassic park    now married to another with a young son who calls grant the dinosaur man apparently for the sole purpose of dredging her up again for the films poorly imagined finale  
grant takes billy along on the kirbys trip  which is really an illegal gambit to save their son  that young paraglider  
the couple arent millionaires  making grants check bogus  and theyre separated as well  eric was with amandas new boyfriend  not that that makes much sense   meaning were in for some gooey family dynamics while waiting for the dino dining  
the kirbys hired hands  and obvious bait  are a threesome led by mr  udesky  michael jeter   the gift    
  didnt anyone consider that casting michael jeter and william h  macy together and not having them be related was a little odd   
as directed by joe johnston   october sky    jumanji    spielberg only produced this one  from a risible script by peter buchman and the  election  team of alexander payne  jim taylor   jurassic park iii  is nothing more than a quickie monster flick with a couple of new dinos  a spinosauraus  which goes head to head with the trex  and pteranodons   
the plot  as it were  is a series of coincidences combined with extreme leaps of faith and a trifecta of stupid cell phone tricks  
the effects are no longer new  and  as shot by television cinematographer shelly johnson  rather murky looking at times  
film editing by robert dalva   october sky   was presumably done by machete  to keep this down to a 90 minute run time  
i know of no other reason to explain the ridiculous ending which features the survivors confronting a pack of raptors  then being saved by the most ludicrous of logic jumps within a few minutes  
original music by don davis just repeats john williams original themes  
while neill and young morgan attempt to inject some humor and humanity into the proceedings  the rest of the cast are plodding unexceptional  
  jurassic park iii  will probably provide some quick entertainment for those who go into it knowing what to expect  the same crowd who maybe liked  the lost world  jurassic park

0	"adam sandler vehicles are never anything special  but continue to make a load of money  
which really goes to show the sad state of cinema today  
while good comedies like rushmore  to choose a recent example  gets limited release and doesnt make a lot of money  big daddy got a huge release and has made a lot of cash  
its also nothing special and doesnt deserve the money its making  
but i digress  
sandler plays sonny koufax  a unemployed new yorker with a seemingly low mental age  
his girlfriend makes a ultimatum to him  either wise up and get responsible  or shes leaving him  
by a strange set of events  koufax ends up with julian  played by twins cole and dylan sprouse  a five year old kid  
after a failed attempt to impress his girlfriend with the child  koufax decides he wants to keep the child  
however  social worker mr brooks  mostel  finds out that koufax isnt the real father and wants to take julian back  
koufax along with his new girlfriend layla  lauren adams  fight to keep the child  
big daddy really isnt that good  
many of the jokes revolve around toilet humour  and supposedly we are meant to find julian and sonny peeing against a wall to be funny  
theres the occasional good one liner  but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour  
the film  after all these silly gags  then suddenly turns sentimental  and this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous  
the court scene at the end of the film is useless and unbelievable  and not helped by the soppy overacting  
its a poor attempt to win over the audience  
adam sandler basically plays the same role he has in his last few films  except the wedding singer   
joey lauren adams is much  much better  and deserves a far better film than this trash  
steve buscemi pops up in a funny cameo  and his scenes are pretty funny  
rob schneider is also funny as a crazy delivery man  
the two twins who play julian are o  k  they start out rather well  but then becoming annoying and brattish halfway through and finally turn all american wholesome goodness at the end of the film  where the tear juice is turned up high  
big daddy is really nothing special  and is not even worth it for a few chuckles  
although it is actually well put together  with nice direction  good production design and even some montages  this professionalism cant help the fact that the script and characters are trash  
big daddy is for die hard fans of sandler  and thats about it

1	"i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool  
i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage  grousing to myself about its transparently planes  trains and automobiles plot machinations  and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement  
this was a mass market romantic comedy  after all  a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and  even in its best days  worked hard to perpetuate the romance  infatuation paradigm  
then marc lawrence did something wonderful  something which made the entire film click into place  he showed me a comic love story about grownups  
it certainly didnt look that way from the outset  which introduces groomtobe ben holmes  ben affleck  at his bachelor party  surrounded by friends and family whooping over his  last night of freedom   
ben loves his fiancee bridget  maura tierney   but the doomandgloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this till death do you part business  
then  on an illfated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah  ben meets sarah lewis  sandra bullock   a freespirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her  
as transportation troubles thwart them at every turn  ben and sarah begin a threeday southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger  ben seeing in sarah the chances hes never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability shes never had  
forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start  setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue  
ben is an ideal role for afflecks easygoing charm  and he plays the straightlaced straight man without forced exasperation  
sandra bullock  for her part  is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last halfdozen films combined  avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping  
the two performances  part of a great toptobottom cast  are effective and connected from the start  yet the scripts apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely  
lively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis  forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like selfjustification  
the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose  leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution  
forces of nature isnt about a man developing a fear of commitment  its about a man learning what commitment means to him  learning that its not what he thought it was  
lawrences script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending  an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense  
earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance  and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine  
though one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film  and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples  forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that youll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom  
that is  provided youre not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes  
for a brisk romantic comedy  forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most overdirected scenes of the year  teetering handheld shots  whynot low or high angles  sweeping pans  
occasionally the hyperreal approach works  with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance  far more often  hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is  covering it with flourishes so thick you almost cant find whats underneath  
a script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director  but even hughes excesses cant spoil this unique concoction  
forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant  something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents

1	"america has finally gotten what its needed for years  a compassionate sincere president with impressive ethics and charisma  
regretfully its only a movie  
president james marshall  harrison ford  is fed up with terrorist activities  
teaming up with the russian government  he orders a strike force capture of alexander radek  a reactionary general ready to reunite the soviet union under his fascist reign  
during a celebration dinner  marshall announces to the world that he will send troops to fight oppression wherever it exists  
  its your turn to be afraid   he declares  
returning home on air force one  he gets the chance to demonstrate his words personally  
ultranationalist militants loyal to radek and lead by ivan korshunov  gary oldman  hijack the plane threatening to kill a hostage every half hour until the general is released  
marshall has a chance to escape in a jettisoned capsule  which clinton says doesnt exist in real life  but refuses  preferring to stay and fight  
director wolfgang peterson   das boot    in the line of fire    outbreak  takes the overused  die hard  theme and gives us something new in a film that combines brilliant acting with holdyourbreath intensity  
if you can take your eyes off the screen  steal a look at the audience  
everyone is totally engrossed  
the two actors do what they do best and they are probably the best there are at it  
oldman has become typecast as a psychotic sadist and no wonder  he does it so well  
when he engages the teenage first daughter in sensitive conversation about his family and the next minute threatens to blow a hole in her forehead  you know that hes over the edge in the manner that people with a cause can become  
you are convinced that young alice could end up terminated at any time  
when korshonov executes passengers  there is a frightening reality to it  
the guns in this film are deadly weapons  not cartoons  
harrison ford has done one role for several years  
his mastery of the man in the suit propelled into desperate action is in top form here  
marshall is a medal of honor recipient who now has a desk job  
realistically  hes a man afraid  but not afraid to act  
ford is one of the few actors that could make us believe that the president of the united states could be an action hero  
indiana jones in the oval office  
he and oldmans archetypes match up perfectly  
the other roles also go to accomplished actors  
glenn close as the determined but unsure vicepresident is the picture of an executive forced into a position that shes not quite ready for  
dean stockwell as defense secretary eager for the authority   im in charge here    
is her political nemesis and turns in a good alexander haig performance  
of course the politics are all wrong  
a cowboy president  even down to his name  with big guns shoots his way through problems  
much like the american collective memory of jfks camelot  the image is wondrous if you dont look too deep  
the pulls on the patriotic heartstrings would be too much in any other film  but they work here  
no matter what political spin you put on the story  the movie is an outstanding one  
i left the theater feeling that there is hope for the countrys future  not a common belief nowadays  
now if we only can get ford to run for president  
just because one actor didnt work out as chief executive doesnt mean that a different one couldnt  
  michael redman has lost count of how many years hes been writing this column  21 years    22 years  while watching the sunflowers outside his window swaying in the cool breezes

0	"there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do  
i delighted in the sneakysmart entertainment of ron underwoods bigundergroundworm yarn tremors  i even giggled at last years criticallysavaged bigunderwatersnake yarn anaconda  
something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth  spent in the company of ghidrah  the creature from the black lagoon and the blob  
deep rising  a bigunderseaserpent yarn  doesnt quite pass the test  
sure enough  all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place  a conspicuously multiethnicmultinational collection of bait    excuse 
me  characters  an isolated location  here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sea  some comic relief  a few cgienhanced grossouts  and at least one big explosion  
there are toocheesytobeaccidental elements  like a sleazy shipping magnate  anthony heald  who also appears to have a doctorate in marine biology  or a slinky international jewel thief  famke janssen  whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold  
as it happens  deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients  
a terrorist crew  led by squintyeyed mercenary hanover  wes studi  and piloted by squintyeyed boat captain finnegan  treat williams   shows up to loot the cruise ship  the sea monsters show up to eat the mercenary crew  a few survivors make it to the closing credits  
and up go the lights  
its hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless filmmaking  especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream  
here  the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j  oconnor  generally amusing as the crews fraidycat mechanic  
writerdirector stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone of actionhorror menace  something overpopulated with goredrenched skeletons  something where the gunfire and special effects are taken a bit too seriously  
deep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that were expected to have a ridiculous good time  not hide our eyes  
case it point  comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda  
in deep rising  one of the creatures victims is regurgitated back into view  partially digested and still alive  
he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance and pain  in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable  
in anaconda  we also see a regurgitated victim  partially digested and still alive  
he looks at another character    and 
winks  
make no mistake  deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency and pacing  
its also gloomy  uninspired and not nearly enough fun  
i dont ask much of my monster movies  but i do ask that they act like monster movies  
you dont have to show me a fantastically impressive  massive beast with tentacles aflailing  
just show me the massive beast burping  and ill figure you get the point

0	"the tagline for this film is   some houses are just born bad   
so i didnt expect too much from this  
but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre  
i thought  liam neeson  cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont  
i thought  mabe it will be fun  
and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing  
but by the end of it i thought  why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones  jan de bont   
these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality  
here is the story  in the monstrously overdecorated mansion known as hill house  visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor  liam neeson  into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation  
among them is a sophisticated bisexual  cathrine zeta jones   a cynical dope  owen wilson  and a gentle and emotional lady  lily taylor   
actually  the doctor is researching the  primordial fear reaction  and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch  
what happens  
but he gets unexpected help from the house itself  
it rumbles  hums and belches forth remarkable sights  
portals become veiny stainedglass eyeballs  
a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth  
filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains  
but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real  placing an emotional wall between audience and screen  
the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture  
is that exciting or what  
the worst thing about it is that it didnt have to be bad  
its based on a great book  the haunting of hill house   by shirley jackson  
a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent  
it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience  
  the blair witch project   that cost less than an old car  managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses  
and with a 70 mill  
budget  de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror  
de  
bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is  in itself  frightening  
he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush  
but why give him a more serious material  
in the end  haunting  will only haunt its fledgling studio  dream works skg  and de bonts career as a director  
yet it wouldnt be fair to say that everything is bad  
the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated  beautiful  mysterious  magical and spooky  
but this is where the good things end  
the music is blaring  the floors moving  the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming  and all of this  every second  every moment of screen time  is absolutely without life  
its nothing more than a special effectsextravaganza  visually impressive  but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesnt engage  
at first you do not know whats going on  
is this part of the experiment  
are these hallucinations  
projections of the subconscience  
paranoia  
but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening  
the house is actually possessed  
it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window  
for ever  i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and thats what i got  
i believe hichock once said that  its  
better to wait for a climax  than to see one   
this may be true  and it might actually work  but there is only one problem  jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary  only stupid  
they are impossible to take seriously  
any paralells that you might have heard before  linking this picture to kubricks  the shining   are absolutely baseless  
  shining  had class  style  story  acting  but most of all talent and originality  
  haunting  has only special effects and art direction to boast of  
and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film  
casting good actors for small  pale parts only makes things worse  
but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write  most of you will see this film anyway  even if the tagline would say   some films are just born stupid

0	"dirtywork has a premise of deliciously meanspirited potential  
mitch weaver  norm macdonald  and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna  artie lange  are losers in life  they were constantly picked on in school  and now they cannot hold regular jobs  
but as the trailer goes   there is one thing mitch weaver is good atrevenge   
so he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in gettingeven schemes into a marketable revengeforhire business called dirty work inc  
this should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy  but for a film called dirtywork  what ensues is rather clean of spirit  
in fact  what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine  but rather a more sappy reason  sams father  jack warden  needs a heart transplant  and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list  his compulsively betting doctor  chevy chase  asks the guys for 50  000 to pay off his bookie  
so for all the scheming that goes on  beneath every underhanded plot isgasp  a 
heart  which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise  
not that there isnt a lot of nastiness on displaythere is  but of a different sort  
there are frequent sexual references  most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sams impotent fathers ongoing lust for them  
and for a film rated pg13  director bob saget  yes  that bob saget  of fullhouse and americasfunniesthomevideos fame  and writers frank sebastiano  fred wolf  and macdonald himself  stretch the boundaries of good taste rather fararguably a bit too much so  was not one  but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary    
but the issue  of course  is not so much of taste as it is humoras in  is it funny or not  
the answer is a resounding no  
its not that macdonald isnt a funny guy  
he was one of the more consistently funny performers on saturdaynightlive before his muchtalkedabout firing  and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen  it also doesnt hurt that hes a natural  likable screen presence  
he is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch  but  for the most part  the oneliners  as written  are flat  and the broad slapstick gags just dont work  one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildingsa real riot   
still  macdonalds few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has  
the late chris farley  as hysterical as he ever was  is amusing in a cameo role  but  as a whole  the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance  
saget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman  adam sandler  and john goodman  but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent dirtywork from sputtering to the end of its brief 81minute running time  
the film closes on a sad note of desperation  an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement  
come to think of it  i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of dirtywork

0	"well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task  
he has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films  
in a domain that he owns  it is very surprising that this goliath of an action star can not tell a good action script from a bad one  
eraser  back in 1996  was a confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense  
batman and robin  in 1997  was the black sheep of the batman series with ridiculous acting  idiotic action scenes  and painfully flashy costumes  
now in 1999   end of days   not  the end of days   is the third strike in a tough at bat for arnold  
is this the end of a powerful action stars longlived career  
will arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance in another unforgettable classic like those in the past   terminator    terminator 2  judgement day    predator    
or an unforgettable performance in a great guilty pleasure like those in the past   commando    red sonja    true lies    
it doesnt look that way  
  end of days  begins with the birth of a baby girl in 1979 who inexorably  due to the formation of the stars on that night  will be the carrier of satans baby the hour before new years of 2000  
fortunately for the movies sake  the girl grows up and now resides in manhattan with skyscrapers  subway trains in dark tunnels  and a myriad of inept nypd officers  
its an action films dream come true when the director is given tons of cool stuff to blow up  
imagine if the girl had lived in anytown  usa  where the only thing to destroy is a dairy queen and a post office  
arnold schwarzenegger  jericho cane   in a series of boring events finds himself in the middle of a religious battle between the church  who is trying to hide the girl  or in some cases trying to kill her   and satan  gabriel byrne  who is trying to make her pregnant  
if the devil is successful  the world will no longer exist as we know it  
jericho feels it is his duty to protect the girl from everyone because 1  he once had faith but no longer does and 2  his wife and daughter were killed and he feels responsible for it  
jericho cane is your cliched  bythenumbers hero right up to his name  
arnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he can  
he shouts at everyone  from cops to priests  to the devil  
in one truly hilarious scene  which was supposed to be the ultimate dramatic high point  jericho screams to the devil   you are a    
choir boy  
you are a choir boy   
those two lines marked the high points of this film  
a movie can still be enjoyable when the supporting cast is more effective than the main actor  
  end of days  fails to contain any memorable performances with the exception of gabriel byrne  
byrne  playing a man who has been made the manifestation of the devil  seems to be the only one who is having fun in this whole movie  
he wonderfully plays a manipulative villain with the power to control everyone at any time  
the annoying thing about his character  however  is that he has the power to kill any human with a simple punch in the face  yet he finds it impossible to seriously hurt jericho  
i can not count the number of times he could have killed jericho and taken the girl from his custody  
the other actors in the film give very weak and unconvincing performances  
kevin pollak  who plays the partner and close friend of jericho  is the supposedly funny character in the film  every action movie has one   
the one problem is that pollak does not deliver one funny line  
robin tunney plays the chosen mother of satans baby with extreme annoyance  
she gets no sympathy from any of the characters in the film  except arnold who pretends she is his wife and daughter  or any of the viewers in the audience  
in one unnecessary scene  tunney walks out of her room and takes her top off  
is this her job in the film  
the actors are not to blame entirely because the script is terrible  
you can tell a script is terrible when you are able to predict what will happen minutes before it does  
this little prediction game is a very fun exception to trying to sit through this nonsense of a movie  
in a last attempt to make this movie good  special effects are used to try to entertain the audience  
but without a memorable action scene in the whole film  the director has not done his job successfully  
this film would have gotten a c if arnold stood in front of a camera and shouted  you are a     
choir boy    
for two hours

0	"i guess that if a very wild bachelor party had gone really bad  there would be broken furniture  traces of smack and cocaine on the floor  and a dead prostitute in the bathroom  
i guess that if a movie had also gone really bad  there might be the same elements present  
coincidence  
poor kyle  a meek looking jon favreau     he is about to marry his radiant fiancee  laura  cameron diaz   
but before he exchanges his vows  he embarks to las vegas with his friends for one last blowout  
but this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly get  
the prostitute has met a horrible  though accidental death  and drugs are everywhere  
the five friends agree that there is enough bad evidence here that will send them to jail for a very long time  
a surprisingly calm robert boyd  christian slater   who looks like he was groomed to make nefarious decisions  ponders their dilemma for a few minutes before deciding that the best thing to do is to bury the body in the desert where shell never be found  
although they stomach the gruesome deed of getting rid of the body  which also disturbingly involves dismantling the body using power saws in order to stuff it into suitcases   when they return from their trip  guilt and paranoia begins to set in which slowly consumes some of the five friends  
one is adam  daniel stern  he grows increasingly agitated  
whenever people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way  his blood pressure increases  
or that just may be because of his dysfunctional family  
another is michael  who was actually responsible for her death  
he tries to bury his feelings  but the burden of guilt begins to affect his judgment as well  
boyd is the  doer of the group  
seemingly suffering from a long psychosis  when he feels as if his secret is about to be exposed  he is apt to take extreme measures to cover up his tracks  
kyle just hopes that his wedding will live up to lauras demanding expectations  
then  theres moore  leland orser  who speaks 5 lines and walks around with a puzzled look on his face  
the problem with this reprehensible movie is that it wants to be a cruel comedy  but it presents things in a manner that just arent funny  
drugs  mutilation  and killing your own friends isnt something to be laughed at  
as a straight psychological drama  i could see how it might have worked  as each one tried to maneuver and overcome the weight of their own guilt in their own sometimessick ways  
but this movie insults us by assuming that we could simply discard our values for 2 hours  
if you do like this movie  i dont think that i want to know you  
i did find slater a convincing leader who sways his friends to choose not the right thing but the  smart play   
and diaz adds some brightness to this film as a weddingneeding fiancee  
but her talents are essentially wasted here  
its obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certain tone  
but the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless  
do not make a very bad decision by seeing this film

1	"the ring is probably one of the creepiest movies ive seen in years  
but then again  ive always had this phobia of asian born horror films  
i remember when i was a kid i was scared as hell with those green faced  longhaired floating ghosts donning their white gownseuuugh  
the ring really brings back those memories and its grips me long after the movie has ended  
unlike the horror films coming from the west  im pretty much used to the gore and visual effects  so much so  they become rather bland nowadays  
theres really no scary movie from the west for a long time  
if you have something in mind  please tell me  
this japanese flick is supposed to be based upon stories written by the stephen king of japan  which is also  i heard  televised over the air in japan  
the film revolves around a mysterious videotape which will bring death for sure to the person who watches it  one week prior to viewing  
a journalist and her husband  stupid enough  tests the so call urban legend and ends up having a week before she meets her doom  
she and her husband then goes on a search for the origin of the videocassette  to get to the root of the whole curse with the hopes of freeing themselves  
the ring plays on the senses like no other horror film today  
visual subtlety  minimal music and an intriguing plot puts the audience within an aura of suspense throughout the entire film  
very well done indeed  especially for a film that does not have a single trace of violence and gore  
now  thats something budding horror filmmaker wannabes should consider looking into  
just an idea of how visually powerful the film is  it is in japanese and subtitled in chinese  both of which  i cant understand at all  ok  i had a friend who gave me a gist prior to watching  but he revealed very little    
the twists in the plot  leading to an unforgettable climax  will definitely leave an impression on the audience  will have you at the edge of your seat

1	"when i saw the trailer for  the sixth sense   i didnt expect much from it  
my snap judgment was that it was a watereddown version of  the shining  or possibly a lateentry in the glut of angelrelated moviestv shows of a couple years ago  
but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot  
it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year  
bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe  
at the beginning of the movie  he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work  but he is soon confronted by vincent  a patient malcolm failed years earlier  donnie wahlbergformer new kidin an impressive cameo   
a year passes  and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed  
cole sear  haley joel osment  is a withdrawn kid who is called  freak  by the other boys in the neighborhood  
weird things seem to happen around colehis mother  olivia williams  leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasnt movedand cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldntfor example  that there was once a gallows in his school  
he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom  
the trailer gave away the movies first major plot twist  
if it hadnt  the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldnt know whats wrong with cole  
if youre lucky enough to have not seen the trailer  stop reading this review right now and go see  the sixth sense   
anyway  since the trailer gave it away  i figure its fair game to discuss here  
once malcolm gains coles trust  cole reveals his secret  he sees ghosts everywhere  
dead people wander around not knowing that theyre dead  invisible to everyone except cole  
malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth  
the box office success of  the sixth sense  has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why thats so  
i hate to burst anybodys bubble  but  the sixth sense  isnt really a horror film  
at its core   the sixth sense  is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionallyscarred adult help each other to move past their problems  
some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy  though  
one that really got to me  the ghost of a boy says to cole   ill show you where my dad keeps his gun   when the ghost turns  we see the bullet wound in the back of his head  
osment gives the best performance ive ever seen from a child actor  
its hard enough to find a grownup in hollywood who can give a subtle  realistic portrayal  
although willis gets top billing  cole is really the protagonist of the story  and osment truly brings the complex kid to life  
if only willis work were as impressive  
accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue  willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm  his most challenging role to date  
  this is a bad omen for his next movie   the story of us   which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage   
writerdirector m  night shyamalan has a light  poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite  
hes also a skillful storyteller  as the movies ending demonstrates  
only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie  
look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole  
bottom line  osment should get an oscar nomination  and you should go see this movie

the latest from the director of  starman    halloween  and  escape from new york  is a lousy western all gussied up to look like a futuristic horror flick

1	"first  i am not a big fan of the xfiles tv series  
i have nothing against it particularly  i just dont happen to watch it  
having said that  i can now say that i liked the xfiles pretty well  
for us nonfans  theres nothing big going for it  but there are a lot of little things  
the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35  000 b  c  
two protohumans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside  
the alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien  
the movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy  lucas black  from sling blade  is captured by the same black ooze  
we then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder  gillian anderson and david duchovny   who have been pulled off of their previous assignment  investigations into the paranormal  and put onto the bomb squad detail  
a caller has threatened a federal building in dallas  texas  
on a hunch  mulder checks out the building across the street  and  wouldnt you know it  he turns out to be right  
the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse  
five people die in the blast  and when mulder learns who the victims were  a light bulb goes on over his head  
the two agents team up to investigate  against fbi orders  the links mulder has made  
their search leads them back to the north texas cave  all across the country  and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to  the truth   
the plot  and  the truth   are uninspired  
i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me  
it didnt  
the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them  
but the point of the xfiles is not what the truth is  but the extent to which it has been hidden  
its a slightly more interesting angle  but it still raises expectations about that  truth  too high  
if this were the whole film  i would say the movie was mediocre  perhaps even boring  
but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it  
the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest  
before the audience can get tired of one location  the agents follow a hot tip to another location  and so on and so forth  
the locations are not all computergenerated sets  either  
there are some artificial settings  but the desert night of nevada  the edge of suburbia in texas  and the endless fields of snow in antarctica  actually somewhere in north america   
make this fantastic film feel more real  
ward russells cinematography is very good  
the overall look is dark and ominous  appropriate to the intended tone of the films plot  
russell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding  
when the movie is set in darkness  the picture quality is still rich and detailed  
finally  and specifically  there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train  
i dont know if the shot is faked in any way  but it looks dangerous  and it looks great  
the movies soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film   skip 
to the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie  there is a spoiler in the following sentences   during the opening prehistoric sequence  a howling wind dogs the soundtrack  never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound  
in one of the movies most effective sequences  metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees  
the visuals of the scene are good  but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound  
there was no question as to who the movies stars would be  
even so  duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination  
both are easy on the eyes and together  they have some good timing  banter  and energy  
there is a hint of chemistry between them  but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship  
they are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street  
there might be some romantic interest  but for now theyre more interested in their environs than they are in each other  
no single element really makes this movie outstanding  not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular  
but enough things were done right that the xfiles is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along

1	"close your eyes for a moment  if you will  and imagine the sound of stephen reas gaelic brogue  silky smooth and irish like a pint of guinness  
a lackadaisical  naughty little schoolboy voice that flirts and gambols  
an acerbic  singsong metered voice that evokes the startling imagery and language of anthony burgess  a clockwork orange   
a voice that deliciously conjures scenes both porcine and puerile  like those out of  delicatessen   or  the tin drum   
imagine all of that  and youll get a good sense of what you can expect from  the butcher boy   
imagine that and more  
neil jordans latest film  stars  rea in more ways than one  
rea  the accomplished irish actor most notable from his star turn in jordans  the crying game   contributes a restrained and managed performance as da brady  a small town drunk in an unnamed irish community in the 1960s  
but its his walltowall narration as the butcher boy of the title  da bradys son  francis  that makes reas  performance  worth watching  worth listening to  
and thats only half the fun  
playing the young francie brady is newcomer eamonn owens and he is  without a doubt  a revelation  
for as much as reas voiceover permeates almost every scene of  the butcher boy   owens commands virtually every frame  
its impossible to take your eyes off him  
with his crop of carrotcolored hair  ruddy complexion  and overall grubby appearance  francie brady is an unlikely hero  refusing to be done in by his alcoholic  trumpetplaying father  his depressive  suicidal mother  or the neighboring  bespectacled monster known as mrs  nugent  fiona shaw   
in fact  everything was ok until  the nugent  came to town  
now  she poses as much a threat to the safety and security of town bully francie and his best pal joe  alan boyle  as the looming commie menace   the butcher boy  is set at a time when the fear of nuclear obliteration is first and foremost in the minds of many   
  pigs   screams mrs  nugent at the brady menagerie  
  youre all pigs   
its the start of many a related image  
after ma brady is shipped off to the  garage  for psychiatric observation and da brady downs one bottle of whiskey too many  francie finally loses grip of his fantasy world of cowboys and indians  the lone ranger  and other comicbook characters  
squealing like a stuck pig  francie does  the likes o that  on the nugents living room floor  and is himself whisked away to a very catholic remand home for  boney arsed bogmen   where his ever fertile imaginationand clever chicaneryrunneth over  
director jordans vivid treatment of pat mccabes nightmare novel produces a sometimes disturbing  dark comedy littered with surreal touches  such as sin  ad oconnor playing the virgin mary   
its not as outlandish as the trailers make out  instead  this remarkable film focuses on the effects external influences have on the friendship between two boys  schoolboy chums in real life   allowing us to empathize with their plight in the presence of extraordinary behavior  
its bleak and its black but its fundamentally very funny  
rea talks us through it  beautifully  and owens drags us though it  admirably  and  in tandem with jordans sure hand  theirs are contributions to make  the butcher boy  a film worth savoring

starring lee kangsheng  yang kueimei directed by tsai mingliang written by tsai and yang pingying cinematography by liao pengjung 
taiwan  241299  
the millenium approaches  
an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city  
sectors of the city are being sealed  quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus  
the virus causes people to act like insects  they crawl about on all fours  hide from bright lights  huddle in damp corners  
the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a weeks time  
residents are advised to evacuate the area  asap  
this premisekafka by way of cronenbergis the background for the hole  which could have been a great movie  but  sadly  ends up as a waste of good ideas  
the quick sketch above suggests a dark  absurd  hallucinatory nearfuture parable of life in the late 20th century  in execution  however  it is nothing like that  
the virus  the evacuation  the visual possiblities of the deluge  these are all relegated to the background  
instead  the hole focuses on the livesfor want of a better wordof a man  lee kangsheng  and a woman  yang kueimei  who live in the same apartment building  and who have no personalities  
the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile  the charmless rooms and corridors of a postindustrial apartment complex  photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible  
its a vivid setting  but an unappealing one  especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background  
the man lives in the apartment directly above the womans  
one day  a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the mans living room  opening into the ceiling of the womans living room  
this holesymbol of the solitary opening in the characters lonely  compartmented livesallows them to interact in unusual  and mostly nonverbal  ways  
example  the man  suffering from the onset of the virus  or so i assumeeverything is obscure in this movie  vomits through the hole  
the woman  wandering around in the dark  accidentally puts her hand on his vomit  and then cleans it up  
this is what passes for meaningful communication  
and they say romance is dead  
much of the film does not even focus on their interactions  such as they are  
there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people  
they are ciphers  
instead  we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives  we watch  for instance  as the woman boils some water  pours it onto some noodles  then eats the noodles  
  this is as fascinating as it sounds   
offered as counterpointor perhaps reliefto these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers  fantasies in which the woman lipsynchs to pop songs by grace chan  popular  so im told  in 1950s china   
she prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells  incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights  
sometimes  in these fantasies  she is joined by the man  
these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful  sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality  but they fail  
when the man and the woman dance  it seems halfhearted and listless  
astaire and rogers this is not  
even in imagination  these people are numb  weary  boring  
the hole is part of the collection 2000 series  a group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of the millenium  
others include canadas last night  brazils midnight  and american hal hartleys the book of life  
the book of life is the only other one that i have seen  and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry  
witty  energetic  humane  it makes the the hole seem  ahem  empty  
american movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements  quick cuts  superficial emotions  
foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does  they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time  and call it art  
the hole is selfevidently a film about alienation  and perhaps director tsai mingliang wants the audience to share in his characters alienation  
if so  he succeeds  
perhaps it is a challenge  he dares us to enjoy this movie  despite his best attempts to ensure that we dont  
if it was a challenge  i wasnt up for it

animation by emily hubley

91 minutes  
rated r  stars  
had  hedwig and the angry inch  came out in the 70s  right after david bowies  ziggy stardust   it likely would now be regarded as one of the most popular rock musicals of all time  
released in the 500 channel  sensory overload world of 2001  however  the big screen adaptation of the acclaimed offbroadway musical must do battle with countless other productions clamoring for attention  
i almost missed it  
every august  the major studios try to squeeze the last few dollars out of summer moviegoers by dumping all of their shakier offerings on the marketplace at once  
i was so busy trying to keep up with national releases like  summer catch  and  bubble boy  that i passed over any independent film that looked like it would only have a short local run  
but an email from a reader asking why i hadnt reviewed the movie prompted me to make a late evening trip to the theater  
thank goodness for readers like him  
  hedwig and the angry inch  is a genderbending glamrock spectacular packed with great songs  
stylistically  the hookladen tunes are reminiscent of bowie   bat out of hell  era meatloaf and  the rocky horror show   without ever seeming like imitations  
as with  tommy    hedwig  tells a story of isolation  pain and defiance  but without the bloated feel of that beloved  but overrated rock opera  
writerdirectorstar john cameron mitchell and composerlyricist stephen trask have cooked up a real winner  
mitchell stars as hedwig  a singer from east berlin touring a chain of u  s  coffee shops with her panslavic band  the angry inch  
while the patrons of the rundown restaurants look on in shock  and sometimes horror  hedwig boldly tells the sad story of her life in song  
she was once a boy named hansel  ben mayergoodman   living with his mother  alberta watson  and listening to rock and roll on american armed forces radio  
life is an exercise in duality for hansel  
a wall splits his hometown into two parts  
mother describes love as the emotion that comes when you find your other half  
as hansel grows up  the duality becomes more pronounced  
after initially mistaking him for a girl  a gi from the states  maurice dean wint  falls in love with hansel and wants to marry him  
alas  hansel will never pass the mandatory physical  
mother helpfully suggests a sex change  but the operation goes bad  hence the references to  the angry inch   yes  i know this part is squirminducing  but stick with me  its worth it   
several years later  mr  right is long gone and hansel becomes hedwig  decked out in a farrah fawcettstyle wig and fronting a band made up of korean women  
hedwig finds a new love in tommy  michael pitt   a beatific lad with a unique take on christianity  
but tommy does hedwig wrong  stealing her songs and becoming a superstar  
cut to the present  
tommy gnosis stadium tour is thriving and hedwig is suing him  
despite warnings from her manager  andrea martin  that she could easily be labeled a stalker  hegwig and her new band  the angry inch  continue their coffee shop tour  shadowing the thief by playing whatever city he is in  
if this sounds like a bizarre premise for a rock musical  take a few seconds and consider the plotlines of  tommy  and  rocky horror   
as hedwig  john cameron mitchell does a magnificent job taking a character that could have simply been a caricature or an icon and turning her into a compelling human being  
mitchell has worldclass style and vocal chords to match  
even though the backstory is unusually strong  mitchell never forgets that the production is first and foremost a rock musical  
everything is propelled by one terrific song after another and  trust me  these are fullfledged rock songs  not the overprocessed fluff that passes for rock in most musicals  
while mitchell remains in the center of the stage throughout the film  there is much of interest on the sidelines  
miriam shor does fine work as yitzhak  hedwigs lover and bandmate  conveying a great deal through expressions alone  
decked out in a bandanna and a surprisingly convincing beard  she makes a mighty attractive man  
as always   sctv  veteran andrea martin is a welcome presence onscreen and michael pitt is beguiling as tommy  the angelicappearing little rat  
artist emily hubley adds to the magic with a string of dandy animated sequences that charm the eye while underlining the central themes of the musical  
  hedwig and the angry inch  surrounds a weird  funny and touching story with a knockout series of songs performed by an exceptional cast  
true originals do not come along very often  dont let this slip out of town without seeing it

0	"the job of the film critic is to see a movie and write a review of it that tells you what its about and why its good or bad  
i feel kind of embarrassed to admit this  but i after having seen  get carter  i really cant tell you what its about although i could go on and on about how and why its a bad movie  
  get carter  falls into that category of  movies that continue to be made for reasons unknown to anyone outside of a hollywood executive board room  
you might call them the  steven seagalmickey rourkejeanclaude van dammewesley snipes school of mediocre actioncrime thrillers   
you know  the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights  shootouts and car chases but really light on plot and character development  
they have stories where the socalled hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without a reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight  chase or shoot at  
sylvester stallone stars as jack carter  a las vegasbased mob enforcer who returns home  for his brothers funeral  
he believes his brother  richie was  taken out  and didnt die from a dwi accident  
carters one of the most cliche badasses ever captured on celluloid  
his face alone is pretty intimidating and theres quite a few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down and speaking with confidence in his  ramboontestosteronetherapy  voice  
stallones performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he doesnt realize hes mocking himself  
the actual story involves carters investigation into his brother richies death  
hes in a town thats not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well  
mickey rourke costars as one of these characters  a sort of crime boss who has something to do with running a porno web site and blackmailing a young internet tycoon  played by alan cummings looking and acting a lot like pee wee herman   
theres also another plot involving richies mistress  a secret cdrom with some convicting and disturbing evidence on it and something terrible involving one of carters stillliving relatives  
im rolling my eyes just thinking about trying to critique all this in a way that could be remotely comprehendible  
i could just rip the screenplay to shreds  plus the direction or the editing or the production values but that would require discussion of nearly every scene in order to explain it all  
i dont like to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally  
yes   get carter  is just that complicated and complex  
and whats worse is that its not this intricate to make it seem smart like  the usual suspects  for example  just the opposite  
you get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart and they probably didnt remember what had already happened and didnt figure out how each scene would lead in to the next one or how the major plot points would work towards the climax  
all you really need to know is that most of the film is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another  asking them what they know  getting information and then realizing that if he wasnt a complete idiot he could have figured it out in the first five minutes  
although the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another  
making a movie entirely about criminals doesnt necessarily mean they have to be unlikable and cliche cutout characters  
mel gibson starred in  payback  a few years ago that had a story not unlike this one but had such a good screenplay you couldnt help but like him even though he was just as bad a guy as jack carter  
so ultimately  get carter  fails for pretty much every selling point it has  
carter is not a likable character and you really dont care if he gets revenge or not  
the action sequences are not at all exciting or original  
the enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all  cmon  you know whos going to win every brawl and shootout and car chase   
in the end you dont feel nearly satisfied with the results  
the filmmakers did a good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possible  
  the city is never mentioned by name but i assume its seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and its always raining  
"
0	"certainly no one would rent ed woods glen or glenda  
expecting to see a good movie  but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didnt know was possible  
in fact  woods infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison  
watching glen or glenda  
i found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together  as a result  it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious  
the movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary  with endless  repetitive narration about transvestites  how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriends clothes without being able to wear them  how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals  and how the main character  glenglenda is  as it reminds us probably half a dozen times   not half man and half woman  but man and woman at the same time   
the camera work is terribleoccasionally the camera lingers on  say  a closed door while the characters talk offscreen  or inexplicably zooms in on someones ear or nose  
wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage  which leads to voicedover nonsequiturs like   yes  our world is a busy and frightening place  with so many people driving their automobiles   
finally  there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankensteinstyle laboratory  delivering pointless lines such as   people  
  
  
all with their own thoughts  
  
  
their own ideas  
  
  
   
while lightning crackles quasiominously overhead  
had wood continued in this vein  glen or glenda  
probably would have been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with the occasional inappropriate horrormovie touch  
unfortunately  he then wanders so far off into left field that you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote the script  
  pull the string  
pull the string   
announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears  
there is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns  this time warning us   beware  
  
  
beware the big green dragon that lurks outside your door  
  
  
  
it eats little boys  
  
  
and puppy dogs tails  
  
  
and big fat snails   
a bizarre nightmare sequence  which is probably meant to be symbolic but instead is just incredibly stupid  ensues  during which glenglenda finds his fiance trapped under a fallen treein the living room  
someone who is apparently intended to be the sinister  green dragon   but looks more like a klingon from the original star trek series  appears to be orchestrating all this  though the film is far from clear on this point  to put it kindly   
near the end of this sceneand here i must confess that wood lost me completelyis a violent sexual encounter on a couch that features two characters who do not even appear in the rest of the movie and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music  
after this scene ends  not a moment too soon   glen or glenda  
returns to its documentary style  but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone  
the film wanders to a dumb happy ending that also seems to abandon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism  but at that point it didnt matter much what happened  
as soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over  glen or glenda  
had pretty much cemented its place in my mind as the most incoherent film i had ever seen  
i honestly think that if i picked up my camcorder and deliberately tried to make the worst movie i possibly could  it still might not match glen or glenda  
for sheer cinematic disaster  
i am giving this movie an f  but im not sure that quite does it justice

usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock  he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight   hes only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do  
if you want to see some brilliant acting  check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loachs hidden agenda  
cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l  i  e   which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge  
big john feels the love that dares not speak its name  but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad  
what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light  
hes an eventempered  funny  robust old man who actually listens to the kids problems  as opposed to their parents and friends  both caught up in the highwire act of their own confused lives   
hell have sexforpay with them only after an elaborate courtship  charming them with temptations from the grownup world  
l  i  e  stands for long island expressway  which slices through the strip malls and middleclass homes of suburbia  
filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a  pretty transparent  metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15year old protagonist  howie  paul franklin dano   
in his opening voiceover  howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road  citing the l  i  e  
highway deaths of filmmaker alan j  pakula  songwriter harry chapin  and his own mother on exit 52  
hes both fascinated and disturbed by the l  i  e   and those feelings are projected onto big john  who follows howie around in his bright red car  but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesnt want to do  
this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies  hes a beast  but ashamed of it   
l  i  e  would have worked best as a halfhour short film about howies illadvised foray into big johns haven  
there is unnecessary padding with howies miserable dad  bruce altman  in the hot seat for a whitecollar crime  degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middleclass houses  and some homoerotic shenanigans with wiseass gary terrio  billy kay   a handsome artful dodger  
rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui  not that we needed another movie on that subject   these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length  
concurrently  the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted  
cox  sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo  is all bluff and bluster  
dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent  
were so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious  calling haley joel    its surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene  
the restraint is admirable  
but l  i  e  s screenplay doesnt always give them the best material  
when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem  the moment feels a bit too precious  
director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john  who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bachs goldberg variations  
its too much  
there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big johns other boy toy  walter masterson   jealous over the newbie  
this plot thread predictably leads to violence  
not content to be a haunting  observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world  like terry zwigoffs superb ghost world   cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note  
its typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet  sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex  philosophical note  
in this regard  l  i  e  
  and countless other indie films  share something in common with blockbuster action films  problems are solved when the obstacle is removed  
how often does real life work this way  
to extend the question  if a movie is striving for realism  do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion  
"
0	"  deep rising  gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively  not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squidlike menace  but the unfolding story is artificial  silly and almost completely derivative of countless other  and  for the most part  better  films  
while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures  take  for example  the schlocky mountain highs of last springs  anaconda    deep rising  has no tongue to put in its cheek  
folks  were only a month into the new year  and already heres a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases  
most of the action takes place on the argonautica  a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage  uhoh  if these people had seen  titanic   then maybe theyd have known to stay home  when its attacked by a giant  tentacled sea creature  
the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian  famke janssen   argonautica owner canton  anthony heald  and a few other crew members  
a mercenary team  lead by resourceful captain john finnegan  treat williams   board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby  
but what their search of the ship uncovers is something bloodsoaked  hungry and not very helpful  
the main problem with  deep rising  is its overt familiarity  the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most scifihorror films in recent memory  
the concept is  leviathan  meets  titanic   with a dash of  speed 2  thrown in for good  or is that bad   
measure  
this monster is equal parts  20  000 leagues under the sea  and  the relic   knows how to open doors like the raptors from  jurassic park  and even gets to expel a halfdigested victim  a neat effect  admittedly  a la the giant snake in  anaconda   
some of the attack sequences are straight out of  jaws  and  alien   
a scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of  alien resurrection   
theres even a jet ski chase like  hard rain   
and the list goes on  
watching  deep rising  s cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself  because none of them have welldeveloped characters  nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy  
williams is affable enough  but his finnegan just isnt believable  
an interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted  pretty famke janssen  best known as  goldeneye  s killer thighs  is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams  while kevin j  oconnor  as finnegans mechanic  provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast  
djimon honsou  who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in decembers  amistad   pops up in a brief part  
he needs to stay away from the water  
the movies final shot is a groaner  as is the 11thhour regurgitation of a subplot involving an onship saboteur  
as if a cast deserving of their snack foodfate isnt bad enough  when you taunt the monster  youre really asking for it    deep rising  is a slow  stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot  
and since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is  the closer we are to the end of the movie  rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isnt out of the question

1	"the question isnt why has grease been reissued  
the answer to that one is easy  to celebrate the movies 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramounts coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity  
no  the question that ought to be asked is  should grease be reissued  
the answer is not an easy one  
grease is a fun movie  an entertaining fantasy of the 50s  embodying all the cliches of that era  
the music is lively and the dance numbers  choreographed by patricia birch  are energetic and highspirited  
travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon  cool  but nonthreatening  
but grease didnt break any new cinematic ground  
it was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider  
what grease is  or has become  is the highestgrossing musical in film history  
ok  lets not be a spoilsport  
grease is a fun and entertaining movie  even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta  olivia newtonjohn  taxis jeff conaway and the multitalented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers  
its nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was  and its sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career  
he could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly  
cinematically  the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur  
between grease and 1996s evita   you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand  
two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre  the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated  no  make that cynical and jaded  
today  if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight  he or she would probably be hooted off the screen  
todays audiences lack the innocence  that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed  
secondly  a lack of talent  
performers with the charisma  the style  the largerthanlife panache of fred astaire  gene kelly  ginger rogers and judy garland are gone  
most singers and dancers remain on the stage  and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts  
a good example is gregory hines  one of the greatest dancers in the world  
he danced a bit in the cotton club  tap and white nights  but those were essentially dramatic vehicles  
so  perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose  
if audiences show enough interest  meaning if the rerelease earns the studio enough revenue  it may spark a revival in movie musicals  
perhaps not original musicals such as singin in the rain  an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers  but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years  
at one time or another  according to the industry rumor mill  hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webbers cats  a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago  the latter reportedly to star madonna  
so  let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals  
let grease be the word that sparks this revival

1	"trekkies  roger nygards energetic and hilarious documentary  brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions  
the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and nonfans alike  
  the film generally writes off the trekkies vs  trekker polemic as not worth arguing about   
the goodspirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable  loud giggles  yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe  
denise crosby  who played tasha yar on  star trek  the next generation   serves as the host  
in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary  oed   
  the oed cites a february  1976 caption in the  new yorker  as the first recorded usage of the word   
unless youve been to the conventions  i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans  
one pointed out  apologetically  that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate  
others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended  several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of  
my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams  
arguably the most famous of all the trekkies  she wears her uniform every waking hour as many diehard fans do  
her claim to fame is that  as a juror on the whitewater trial  she wore it in court as well  
  every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcanlike stoicism   she says  describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession  
she doesnt quite understand all of the uproar  
  im an officer of the federation 24 hours a day   she reminds us  
her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith  
along with the laugher the show evokes  there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty  
and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment  
few other avocations could give this much satisfaction  
these people are having the time of their lives  
  for the record  im not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies   
the film interviews the various star trek seriess stars as well as its fans  
the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade  but over twenty years later  the conventions are still going strong  
filled with anecdotes  the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions  
at one  the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel  
after appearing briefly  he drank some water and left  
they decided to auction off his halfempty glass  joking that it had the  q virus   
the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too  
with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity  
not just flitting among people  the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies  
one guy is a trekkie crossdresser  another dresses her cat  and then there is the dentist  
the dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek set  
he  his oral hygienists  his receptionist  his wife  and his kids wear the outfits all of the time  
it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home  but not his family  
for variety  he and his family do change characters from time to time  
he says his patients like it  
well  there was this one complainer  but he had a problem with his bill anyway  
there are summer schools for klingon with ph  d  linguists to teach the language  
hamlet is now available in klingon  albeit perhaps not at your local bookstore  and they are working on translating the bible  
they even sell united federation passports that are real enough that trekkies have used them to fool customs  even u  s  customs  
the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the seriess larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns  
sandwiched inbetween the levity  the switch in tone doesnt work  
the incessantly upbeat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator  
he fits right in  
trekkies runs a breezy 1  26  
it is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages

last year  the benevolent studio gods gave us digimon  and this year  they bestow max keebles big move on delighted moviegoers across the country  
parents will be thrilled because theyll finally have something to drag little austin and kayla to see that doesnt smell nearly as much like ass as digimon did  
dont get me wrong  keeble  which is actually only a  ment  away from being a fetish film  isnt that entertaining  
in fact  youd be better off waiting to blow your disposable income when the real kiddie pics  monsters  inc   harry potter  come out next month  
but if dubya dubya iii tells you to go out and spend money to stimulate the economy  then youd better do it  because gassing up the minivan twice a week just isnt going to cut it   
we first see young max keeble  alex d  linz  home alone 3  as a pintsized superhero  delivering newspapers with the pinpoint accuracy of a david beckham cross  foiling the diabolical plans of the evil ice cream man  jamie kennedy  jay and silent bob strike back  and landing the neighborhood honey  brooke anne smith   who  by the way  is the hottest chick in a disney film since emmanuelle chriqui played claire boner in snow day  
the scenario is  of course  a dream  
max is really a doofus and he wakes up on his first day of junior high school with a pessimistic attitude  no luck with the ladies and only two friends  both of whom can kindly be described as social outcasts  and who were both in snow day   the perpetually robed robe  josh peck  and a clarinetplaying cutie named megan  summer catchs zena grey   who harbors secret feelings for max  
things dont get any better for max when he arrives at school  
he has to contend with  among other things  a redhot science teacher  amber valletta  family man   a pair of polaropposite bullies  noel fisher and orlando brown   and an illiterate principal  larry miller  the princess diaries  whos secretly diverting the schools last dime into the football program  
when maxs father  grownup nerd robert carradine  unexpectedly announces the family is moving to a new town at the end of the week  max decides this is the perfect time to exact revenge on everyone who pisses him off  
whoa  dont worry  parents  
he doesnt do it kleboldharris style  
its all pretty tame stuff  but max ends up in hot water when dad nixes the move  leaving his son dangling in the wind like so many tampon strings  
director tim hill  muppets from space  adds a few nice touches  like maxs voiceover character introductions for the films main characters and a flashback scene thats pretty funny  but there isnt too much else happening here stylewise    unless 
you count some farting  a little puking  and a couple of bizarre cameos from tony hawk and lil romeo  
1  30  pg for some bullying and crude humor

0	"i am a steven seagal fan  
i only say this now because  mufti splenetik  isnt my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things  
any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on  
seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue  heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones  which well always hear when seagal does his limbtwisting thing   rarely a female colead in sight  unless its a reallife modelwife who hasnt worked since weird science  and  usually the worst possible titles you can imagine  
not to mention very straightforward plots  generally allround bad dialogue and mr implacable leatherface himself in that same black outfit hes been in since nico doing his  my hands are sharp  nimble knives  thing  seagal the stoic  sir petrified ponytail  duke of dull  
in the glimmer man  seagal breaks out of this formula  he gets a  sidekick   attempts to banter  and puts on a new vest  
hes also put on quite a lot of weight  
small potatoes  you may say  a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to  but damnit  if it aint broke  why fix it  
  more on this disappointed persons dashed expectations later   
as jack cole  seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past  
while he and his partner  played by keenen ivory wayans  are investigating a series of ritual killings  cole himself becomes a suspect  especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole  
it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin  you just cant trust these homicide detectives   someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them  and hence  well  you know  that  glimmer man  thing  
an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger  more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman  bob gunton   coles former cia boss  brian cox  and deals involving chemical weapons  
the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff  drawing  as with his other films  elements from the hotter films of the year  eg  se7en   
its the other changes that disappoint  
for example  although theres a fair amount of violence in this movie  theres also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans  probably the best known of the wayans tribe  how many are there  exactly   from televisions  in living colour   
wayans plays whiney straightman to seagals beadadorned and brocadedraped cole  keeping up his  are you crazy  part of the dialogue with wasted zest  
as campbell  wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partners eccentric habits  but the chemistry between the two is minimal  and seagals wooden comebacks make for painful watching  
a cook in under seige 2  seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble  
he chants  refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies  
again  a benign  if trite  plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual  
heck  he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film  
is that a lot to ask of the seague  
too much  
seagals best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies  to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages  and to do it silently  and alone  
not for seagal  the snappy oneliners of arnold and stallone  nor the attempts to show that he can act  much less think  
no kindergarten cop  no oscar  just simple  unadulterated deathblows  
thats really how it must have started  likeminded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing  knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else  
we trusted him  
we got to know him  
now  betrayal  
i dont know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that hes going to try to be funny again  
ill try  but it wont be easy  
if you havent watched the glimmer man yet  you might want to wait for the video to come out  
its easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences  
after all  if we cant depend on our fantasies  what can we depend on  
the flying inkpot rating system   wait for the tv2 broadcast  
   a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha  
    pretty good  bring a friend  
     amazing  potent stuff  
      perfection  
see it twice  
mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan  
everybody makes mistakes once in awhile

0	"the king and i  a warner brothers animated  musical feature  recycles the classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king  with obvious results  
when anna  miranda richardson   a british schoolteacher  travels to saim to educate the kings  martin vidnovic  children  she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly  and must say something to the greedy ruler  
meanwhile  the kings prime minister  ian richardson   the stereotypical villain  plots to overthrow the king  taking the throne  
the last  and most predictable  main subplot deals with the kings son  allen d  hong   and his love for a servant  tuptim  armi arabe   and how he conflicts with his feelings  and the ancient laws of saim  
not even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent  as the king and is problems could fill the blank pages of a journal  
i will only note the major difficulties  for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail  
the screenplay  written by arthur rankin  peter bakalian  jacqeline feather  and david seidler  which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein  has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory  as every time the obnoxious king would shout   etc  etc  etc   i would cringe  
literally  
speaking of cringing i did quite a bit of this during the rather short film  which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking  
besides the repetitive dialogue from the king  on the whole  the songs seem out of place  and unlike the lyrics  are unmagical  
the sole song which is used cleverly is  getting to know you   which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors  which they have never been exposed to  
unlike disney animated features  the king and is songs dont add to the film  and are as uneffective as could be  
take the following scenario as an example  as the sheer horror of the king and is music is at its worst  
youre being hunted by a dragon  
what do you do   
sing a happy song  
martin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion you hear the saying two negatives dont make a positive  
believe it  
with the terrible dialogue that the king has  along with his awful voice track  the king is completely unbelievable  only shows mild signs of any personality  and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says  etc   etc   etc    more and more as the film progresses  
no personality at the beginning of the movie  none at the end  
and where does this characters personality change  
hey  i thought anna was supposed to change him  
isnt that the whole plot  
the prime ministers hideous sidekick  darrell hammond  brings his share of cringes as well  oh no  
another one of his teeth fell out  
hardyharhar  
he is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets  but even at age five i would have cringed while watching him  
by the way this review is going  you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films hence why i hate this movie  because the king and i is a disgrace to animation  
animated films  such as 1994s the lion king and 1998s the prince of egypt  are among my favorite movies of all time  
the animation team does design their share of well animated settings  so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king  until i realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds  
i have not read the play  or seen the oscar winning  1956 film adaption  but from what i can tell  the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play  for the king and i is never magical  nor interesting  
if it wasnt for miranda richardson  who voices anna with feeling  the king and i could earn the title   worst movie of the decade   
instead  the king and i will just go down as among the years worst  
the bottom line avoid this movie at all costs  
not even young children  the target audience in this film  will enjoy it  
not the slightest bit

0	"  first rule of fight club is  dont talk about fight club   
this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film  because quite frankly  its not even worth mentioning  
director david fincher  seven  has completely gone over the edge  
with crude humor  an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture  im surprised i didnt walk out  
this just goes to show that hype kills  
its very rare that a film so hyped up as  fight club  turns out to be noteworthy  and this is no exception  
the story goes like this  
edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions  until he meets marla  helena bonham carter   
norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle  when he spots her at a session that he also attended  
apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like  literally living in pain  
why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me  but things do get worse  
norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling  and its on a plane that he meets tyler durden  brad pitt   
the two men develop a bond  and go out to a bar  and by golly after they get drunk  the two pitiful characters fight  
how do they come up with this stuff  
anyway  their fighting catches other pathetic losers attention  and a club is formed  
out of all this mess  there manages to lie a message  
fincher shows us that society is like robots  
we work in our jobs doing things step by step  and want out  
our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are  and we blame it on others  
call me crazy  but this is common knowledge  
i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is  which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably  
even with two good actors  and a solid actress  they only manage to weaken the story  
i couldnt help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp  
it just shows how desperate the script is for attention  
i guess brad pitt was right for this role  because i felt like beating him up myself  
his bothersome and depressing character  made me disgusted at his 20 million fee  
it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more  
helena bonham carter however really had no purpose  
she just popped up on screen  mumbled some lines  smoked and left  
this continues for what seems like 6 hours  
the film drags on and my headache gets bigger  while  fight club  nears what i think might be the end  
unfortunately by then  the film hits rock bottom  
though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes  it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace  
on a side note  the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film  that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer  
fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson  
concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment  wont do any good if everything else is in need of support  
also  im afraid that immature men might respond to the films violence  
the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult  
when the film ends  im just glad to get home and take some advil  
youll either enjoy what the film has to offer  or agree with ed norton when he says  this is so f    ing stupid

0	"a sensuous romantic comedy  about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom  
there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out  its the kind of stuff ive seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny  
the film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen  lope cruz  who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations  the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot  but who cant get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story  
pen  lope was wonderful in pedro almod  vars  all about my mother   but here she is so visible in such a stale story  where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking  that she somehow looks ridiculous  as if she got egg all over her face  
the best you can say about her  is that shes not to blame for this picture being so off  
this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex  is in my opinion  worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will  
the story is all about the love  motion sickness  and cooking ability of isabella  cruz   who is born in bahia  brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents cook  
to cure her motion sickness  her parents tried every remedy  until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure  
she is able to control it now as long as she doesnt drive a car  ride elevators  follow in dancing  and is the woman on top when making love  
in other words  she has to be in control of things  
in her small fishing town she falls in love with a handsome macho latin waiter  toninho oliveira  murilo ben  cio  and marries him  
they open up a successful restaurant  where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it  even though hes a loafer  
one night she catches him in bed with another girl and decides to leave for san francisco  
we dont see her in flight  so i cant tell how she handled her motion sickness problem  unless she flew the plane  
she visits her friends apartment monica  harold perrineau jr    who is a crossdresser  blending right into the san francisco scene  
to cast away her love for the irresistible toninho  she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell  freeing her from ever loving him again  
her luck changes when a local tv producer cliff  mark feurerstein  gets a whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in a spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show  
you can really write the script from here on by yourself    as the despondent toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had  but things continue to go bad for him  there is a curse he caused on the fishing in his village  there is no chef to replace his wife  as the restaurant is about to close for good  
so he comes to san francisco  figuring he can charm her again  
he brings along with him his guitar playing musicians  the ones he used when courting her  when he serenaded her under her window  
he sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick  the yuppie tv producer chasing after her  and sees that she is no longer charmed by him  
when he sneaks on her tv show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and him singing corny love songs to her  the ratings go up and hes hired as a regular on the show  
the show gets so big  that the network honchos come onboard  taking it national  
but they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show  get rid of monica because hes a freak  have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses  and they change her ethnic dresses to lowcut vanna white type of sexy dresses  
cliff  her wouldbe boyfriend  acts creepy and sides with the network bigshots  even though he loved everything she did  
these tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos  they were revolting  
it was an insult to ones intelligence  
im sure that im not spoiling the ending for anyone  when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again  
if the film wasnt terrible enough  monica and cliff act on their attraction for each other and become lovers  
it was so awkwardly done  that it had no sense of truth or humor to it  
this film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film  because it doesnt look or feel like an almod  var film  the type of film it aspired to be  but more like a film that was interferred with from above  
its more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic  as it searches for box office heaven

1	"based on the boris karloffs classic by the same name  the mummy starts off with the highpriest of osiris  imhotep  who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible  bandaged up  having his tongue removed  and being covered in flesheating scarab beetles  then entombed    all while still alive  
recap a few thousand years later  where a soldier named rick  played by brandan fraser  aids a young historian named evelyn  played by rachel wiesz  and her brother  jonathan  played by john hannah  in finding the book of amon ra  in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy  
problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress  using evelyn as a sacrifice    
walking in with relatively low expectations  i thought this movie was actually pretty good  
the visuals and cgi are astounding  and obviously not cheaply done at all  
they pack a ton of detail into the images  especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi  
the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes  such as unnerving moments involving flesheating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him  after all  those who took his artifacts are cursed   
unfortunately  the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time  becoming a tug of war for control between genres  
on one hand  it is a fast paced action film  
on the other  its a frightening horror film  
and on the side  its a hilarious comedy  
ideally  for it to be successful  the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect  with one character serving as the comic relief  that would be johnson   
the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief  with rick occasionally delivering his witty oneliner  
if they were trying to make a horroractioncomedy  it would have helped if it were established early on in the film  but unfortunately  with the backstory of imhoteps entombment  that would be impossible  
and then theres the slapstick fight scene between a swordwielding rick and an army of mummies  
while really well done  it had the feel of slapstick comedy  
replace the sword with a chainsaw and youd effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness  
while entertaining and funny  it feels really out of place  
but at least its a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of  
on the whole  the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end  entertaining the audience  
but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners    turn 
the sound down  
while a lot of theatres have good sound systems  my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre  the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if youre not careful   
when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film   end of days   it was so loud i couldnt make anything out

0	"you would think that this films dismal failure would be due to american filmmakers getting hold of a brilliant british comedy and  americanizing  it  
youd be wrong  since full blame can be placed on the very folks who wrote and created the series  rowan atkinson  robin driscoll  and richard curtis  
should you ever happen to meet those chaps  do me a favor  
grab them by the hair and yell really loudly in their ear   what were you thinking   
have you ever heard the phrase if it aint broke dont fix it    
then walk away  
the film concerns mr  bean  atkinson  and his visit to america while escorting the painting of  whistlers mother  to an american buyer  played by burt reynolds  in the type of bit part that his success in  boogie nights  should hopefully do away with   
now how or why mr  bean is sent on this trip makes no sense  and i cant even describe how the film explains it  
the point is that mr  bean comes to america and causes wacky trouble  
problems problems problems  where to begin  
first  the score music from the tv show has been completely replaced by score that is either at times one note away from the score from  beetlejuice  or one note away from the score from  rob roy   
then  the song choices are totally uninspired  
  good vibrations   
  i love l  a    
wow  dont put any thought into that guys  
also  bean makes way too much noise in the film  
the character doesnt speak much  but in the series you really only heard the laughter of the audience  and maybe the occasional murmur from mr  bean  
each episode was like a chaplin silent movie  
in the film  bean is constantly moaning  grunting  whining  etc  its annoying  and just plain wrong for the character  
the main problem though is that its just not funny  
with each episode of the series there would be dozens of really great laughs crammed into less than 30 minutes  
multiply that running time by three however  and the laughs steadily decrease  
they even have the gaul to repeat jokes from the series  
sad  and creatively lazy  
as a series   mr  bean  only ran for about 13 episodes or so  
why on earth did atkinson and the gang decide it was time to completely rework everything  
13 halfhour episodes certainly hadnt exhausted all possible situations  
all i can say positively for the film at this point is that its almost appropriate for all ages  if it wasnt for a couple of scenes where it appears as though mr  bean is having sex with things  
and even that isnt a very positive statement  
please guys  go back to england and go back to television so youll make me laugh again

1	"having not seen   who framed roger rabbit  in over 10 years  and not remembering much besides that i liked it then  i decided to rent it recently  
watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is  
aside from the fact that its a milestone in animation in movies  its the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters  have them interact  and make it convincingly real  and a great entertainment its also quite an effective comedymystery  
while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original  especially baby herman  and watching them together is a lot of fun  
the story begins in hollywood in 1947  
cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work  so hardboiled private detective eddie valiant  bob hoskins  is called in by studio head r  k  
maroon  alan tilvern  to try to help get rogers mind back on work  
maroon thinks that rogers wife  jessicas  possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots  
valiant takes some photos of jessica playing  patty cake with marvin acme  stubby kaye   the owner of toontown  where all of the cartoon characters live  and takes them to maroon  
upon seeing them  roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect  
the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town  and eventually toontown  trying to clear rogers good name  
along the way they meet judge doom  christopher lloyd  a judgejuryand executioner type whos out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a toon   
who framed roger rabbit won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters  williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in   
director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production  which included hundreds of animators  
also bob hoskins performance should be credited  
he  in addition to the rest of the human cast  finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon costars  
according to the internet movie database  hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off  
who framed roger rabbit is a rare film  
one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family  although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom   
do yourself a favor and rent it  ppppplease

1	"i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater  on a sunday afternoon  
when the movie was over and the audience was exiting  i didnt hear one negative comment  and i didnt have any to offer  
simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys  simon  ian michael smith  and joe  joseph mazzello   and what destiny holds for both of them  
simon is a dwarf  who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart  
surprisingly  he does  and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle  
simon thinks god has a plan for him  a purpose for his life  and his condition  he just doesnt know what  
joe is an illegitimate child  referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard   whos mom  ashley judd  wont tell him who his father is  
simon has more than just dwarfism as a problem  the people in the town dont really like him  because he isnt  natural   
even his own parents dont care about him  and are disappointed they didnt have a  normal  son  
he is also harassed in church by the local pastor  rev  russell  david strathairn  and simons chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks  
the only person  other than joe  that really cares for simon is joes mom  who he also looks up to as a mother  
it would be just simons luck  that he would accidentally kills joes mom  something you are told at the beginning of the movie  
joe  now motherless as well as fatherless  feels the need to find out who his real father is  
with the help of ben  oliver platt   the local drama teacher and joes moms current boyfriend  before her death   he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way  
most of this trouble is laugh out loud funny  although not all of it is  
simon will also look for gods plan for him  although he loses a little faith along the way  
starring in the first  and last  five minutes of the film is hollywoods newest dramatic actor  jim carrey  
jim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off  and then tying it up just right  
this is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway  and he does a commendable job  
simon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson  this is his first film as director  but he has written several films  including the grumpy old men series  
he does an outstanding writing and directing job here  the films structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly  
the dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat  
the cast is excellent  
joseph mazzello gives the stand out performance  
joseph is outstanding for someone of any age  not alone someone who just turned 15  
ian michael smith  in his film debut  has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation  
other great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast  
i loved this movie  it is far and away one of the best films i have seen all year  
take your whole family to see simon birch  it is a magnificent film an american masterpiece

0	"prereview note  seeing as the only concern of body shots is  sex   i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review  
because of this  i will try to vary word descriptions of  sex   meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms  and  or your name is jerry falwell  you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen   so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend  fret not  its most likely just another way of referring to  sex   
i think wed all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review  
though not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what  
body shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously  in the way youd normally expect to see a violent attack  
its about people who think about screwing  seek it out  and talk about it  
these are things we all do  sometimes  
the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts  
their lives center around the next sexual encounter  but they seemed depressed  
its as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek  
at its core body shots is a message movie  the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition  
michael cristoffer  who directed gia  another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil  is a moralist with nothing new to say  
his characters dont communicate anything of interest to each other  so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera  
they voice simplistic platitudes like  i like to come  or  sex without love equals violence   
huh  
and yes that is as complex as this movies observations get  
the characters are stupid and shallow  with not one registering as anything more  
the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure  then the after math  the morning after  of such events  
we meet the characters as they speak directly to us  confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy  
i would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them  giving you the pros and cons  but for this film i cannot  
im not trying to be clever or witty  but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others  
with the exception of trent  played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman   the rest fade into each other a patchwork of fake breasts  defined abs  pearly white teeth  and creamy  flawless skin  
i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one  only because his character gets the worst lines   sex without love equals violence    
in between all the confessionals  cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial  with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning  
the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me  
this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining  
if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f   kobsessed  fine  i dont have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way  but cristoffer only gives us one side  
additionally that one side isnt even entertaining  the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness  
or realism  
one sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters  
they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason  other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other    alas  if it could only be that easy    kidding of course   then  not only isnt it erotic  it isnt real  
it doesnt feel like an authentic sexual encounter  
every f   k scene in this film  and there are many  is treated in the same unsexy manner  
body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film  
it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it  and most of all  it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it  
the resulting search for nookie  and you can take that cookie     over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow  
the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred  
the film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape  one where it is consensual the other where it is not  and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off  
this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently  and if memory serves me i cant think of one film that has done so  and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80s next to wall street  
unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care  not the writer  the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off  
paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here  though boogie nights succeeded  
it was similarly moralistic  but it gave us two different viewpoints  it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters  and it showed us the possible fallout of such a decision  
the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here  but anderson seemed to care about them  
he gave them heart  
cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones  
he preaches to us  by using his characters to preach to us  
this is not the way to get any message across  
why not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin skins  
cristofer kind of does that  though without an ounce of insight  and with a helping of leering exploitation  
"
1	"from the commercials  this looks like a mildmannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight  
instead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end  
the concept is deceptively pedestrian  
an adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way  
the movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea  
the son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents  
following one dead end lead after another  each funnier than the previous  they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents  alan alda and lily tomlin  
its difficult to condense the mileaminute plot  
seemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one  
without giving too much away  one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol  tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bisexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion  
and its all done in a fairly clean  almost  well  maybe not exactly  family fare manner  
a grand cast  tomlin  alda  moore  ben stiller  patricia arquette  tea leoni  george segal  interacts in a seamless parade of laughs  
drawing from a more hyper woody allen style  the film succeeds beyond expectations  
"
1	"in the wake of the smashing success of  rumble in the bronx   its looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release  
rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii  
the version i have is a copy from the laserdisc  its widescreen and bilinguallysubtitled  as are most hong kong films these days  
availability over here in the united states is very limited  these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng  
the subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read  the letters are white and a bit small  
although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed  this review is of the subtitled version  so please keep that in mind if youre reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it  
to be fair  i must admit that ive never been very fond of  periodpiece  martial arts moviesthe ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past  
perhaps its because most of those ive seen were filmed on inferior stock  with either butchered dubbing or allbutillegible subtitling  or perhaps its because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and  in many cases  all but nonexistant  
in fact  many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end  
or  for that matter  it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings  armour of god  rumble in the bronx  etc   tend to have more spectacular stunts  often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions  whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts  
having said that  i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above  is one of the better martial arts films ive seen  and i quite enjoyed it  
surprised  
well  so was i  
drunken master ii is about a young man named wong feihong  played by jackie chan  who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu  
where he learned this style is uncertain  as his father  wong keiying  ti lung  is steadfast in his opposition to feihongs practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu  
apparently  feihong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore  rather like paul bunyan is for americans  but ive heard very little about this  and could quite well be wrong  so ill leave analysis of that to the people who know it better  
one of my friends points out that the character of wong feihong is also featured in the  once upon a time in china  movies  but i have not yet seen those  
the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy  as are the plots to many such films  but if youre watching a jackie chan film  odds are you arent expecting something on the order of  war and peace   
the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics  and hence  chinas cultural heritage  while overworking  underpaying  and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill  
however  this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the filmfeihongs perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend  supplicate his father  keep his  pregnant  mother  played by anita mui  from fighting  and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs  
the macguffin that drives the plot  s  is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners  
in the beginning  feihong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identicallywrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer  
in the process  he clashes with another thief  who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng  
after feihong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners lackies  thanks to some timely intervention by a generals son  a cameo appearance by andy lau  who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii    comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when feihong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng  
and so it goes  
and the plot thickens later on  such as when feihongs girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival  or when feihong and the thief  now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners  are attacked en masse  another grand kungfu movie tradition   but i think ive already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves  
lets move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies    the 
action  
theres plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie    of 
course  in a kung fu film  thats to be expected  
however  this isnt just another kung fu movie  this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography  and jackie chan is a genius  
the primary martial arts  style  featured in the film is drunken boxing  a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk  
further  for the purposes of this film at least  drunken boxers fight better when they actually are intoxicated    but 
theres a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor  
under normal circumstances  the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid  but jackie pulls it off with flair  
the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper  so ill just say that the fightsespecially the big climactic fight at the endin themselves make the movie worth watching  
another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work  
even without motor vehicles  well  not counting a train   there are some remarkable stunts in this film  
among other things  jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals  not once  but at least twice  if you count the outtake shown during the credits   
  quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database   
unlike in american films  these stunts are not faked  
drunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene  including jackie  ti lung   a better tomorrow  1  2   and anita mui  the  heroic trio  series   rumble in the bronx    
the performances are firstrate  especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film  
the scene where feihong and his mother conspire literally behind feihongs fathers back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious  as is the scene where feihongs mother  having just revealed that she is pregnant  is threatening to hurt herself  in order to draw her husbands anger away from feihong   
jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years  and hes in fine form all through drunken master ii  
as far as cinematography is concerned  it certainly works for this film  
its nothing spectacular  but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s  
the picture is crisp and clear  
one thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that  at least in the copy i have  the screen was wider than any film ive ever seen on videotape beforealmost a whole 13 of the screen was blocked out above and below  
  watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can   
it will be an utter shame if this film is eventually panandscanned for american video release  
drunken master ii shows the full potential of  period piece  kung fu movies  and its good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies  
the plot does meander a bit  but thats to be expected in this type of film  
if you like this kind of movie  youll love this movie  and if not  well  give it a chance anyway  
if nothing else  the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental

however  his good friend walter j  hill  robert mitchum  happens to be very good lawyer  so jack might even prove his innocence in the end  
belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller  woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots  
unfortunately  this film isnt comedy and any laugh is unintentional  
the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them  
the actors that play them dont help either  
that is especially the case with jeff fahey  whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison  
his partner bo derek  on the other hand  shows that she didnt age enough to cease being the sex goddess  but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents  
ginty  on the other hand  tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting  but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer

1	"the bond series is an island in the film world  where else would we look forward to cliches  and all of the other things that occur in most of these films  
where else would pure escapism  a vulnerable hero  the  talking villains   blatant product placement  predictable action sequences  and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change  
i dont understand it myself  but thats what the bond series is based on  
for  i think  18 films  weve mostly got the same thing over and over again  with some variation  and a bit of change  most notably in the two dalton films   
but even i  a king of cynicism  cant bitch about it  
and  tomorrow never dies   the  again  i think  eighteenth bond film  and second brosnan bond film  is no exception  
thank god  
the plot  as in most of them  is pure balderdash  but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it  
instead of just plain billionaire psychotics  we get a rupert murdochesque media mogulpsychotic  elliot carver  jonathan pryce  looking bitching with a whitehaired cru cut  and always talking like hes out of breath   who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war  
no  this is not  wag the dog   he wants a real war  between china and england  and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it    in 
comes bond  
james is sent all around the world  trying to do research on carver  fighting with his men  and running into  on more than one occasion  a chinese secret agent like him  wai lin  michelle yeoh  asian action star extraordinaire    and 
costar of  supercop   nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one   
the two eventually  and predictably of course  begin working together  and yes  there is some sexual tension between the two  
luckily  their relationship is never strained  and she never gives into his cassanovaness until the finale  
thank god again  
in every bond film  james bags  on average  three women  sometimes more  sometimes less  the latter being more potent towards the aidscautionary dalton   and he doesnt spoil this one  though we never see them  of course  i mean  they need to stay around a pg13 rating   
theres always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again  the big bond girl  yeoh   and this time we have an almostcameo by teri hatcher as carvers wife  paris  who  it seems  was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning  
yes  teris very attractive  but she seems kind of dull  
of course  its not really her fault  her part is underwritten  and shes only in a small part of it  
oh well  
and there are always the big henchmen  the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains  
this time we get a tall  arianlooking  not to mention robert shaw in  from russia with love  looking  guy named stamper  goetz otto   who is pretty awesome  although a bit stiff  well  mostly his posture  really   
and for a bit of comedy  we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point  
the government people have small parts  as usual  with q  desmond llewelyn  looking near death  sadly  getting only one scene  in a more grouchy mood than usual   and m  judi dench   getting more than m usually gets  i mean  it is judi dench   
and for no reason whatsoever  except cause he was so good in  goldeneye   joe don baker shows up again as wade  admitting he has no reason for being there  and is this time more annoying  
again  oh well  
the action sequences are not a letdown  although sometimes go on too long  
they pop up every now and then  mainly because they have to  for the sake of the series   and some significant ones are the opening one  one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control  and a motorcylce chase  on a bmw cycle  nonetheless  through china streets  or was it vietnam    the 
plots not really essential   
theyre more hightech  and feature much more laughs  which  yeah  i dig  
so what if theyre distracting  theyre supposed to be  
the acting  from most around is great  
yeoh is  actually  one of the better bond girls  mainly because shes so unique  
the better bond girls are more independent  and have a certain wilyness to them  
pussy galore  with her homoerotic undertones and all  is one of the best  and diana rigg  who married bond at the end of  on her majestys secret service  only to be killed  added some emotional depth  
yeoh is notable since shes so active  and has great chemistry with brosnan  
pryce is an awesome villain  being slimy and lovable at the same time  
and brosnan is  once again  the mack daddy  
the bond series is built on cliches  mainly because theyre so fun and add to the escapism  
if you can remember the dalton years  and theyre serious direction  you remember how unsuccessful they were  both financially and aesthetically  
the series would falter if bogged down with too much plot  too many themes  and too much characterization  
i dont really understand it myself  yet im one of the bigger fans of the series in the northeast united states  
having seen all of them more than once  yes  ive seen this twice already   you can tell i adore them  
while its not one of the best  like  goldfinger  or  from russia with love    tomorrow never dies  is nonetheless a truly awesome installment  even if not being as fully amazing as some of the better ones

0	"an 80year old woman jumps enthusiastically on her couch  wearing tightfitting leather  as she cheers on her favorite tv wrestler by calling his opponent a pumpbitch  
two men messily eat fast food as their septic truck leaks raw sewage directly behind them  
and roughly 17 people are booted in the crotch  
welcome to ready to rumble  
judging from the fact that pottymouth adam sandler is the reigning boxoffice comedy champion  you realize  albeit while shaking your head  that yes  there is an audience for this sort of thing  
ladies and gentlemen  i weep for society  
mind you  when executed with style and comic ingenuity  jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel  theres something about mary  and a laxativeinduced attack of explosive diarrhea  dumb and dumber  can be extremely funny  
unfortunately  ready to rumble is not being helmed by the farrelly brothers  nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired  
ready to rumble is built around the dedicated fanbase of professional wrestling     
which  in fact  sounded like a fine concept for a goofball comedy  
but director brian robbins and screenwriter steven brill handcuff themselves  and limited to a stampede of asinine  humdrum bathroom humor  basically the only thing they manage is to evoke memories of pauly shore and bio dome  
gordie boggs  david arquette  and sean dawkins  scott caan  take pride in being hardcore wcw wrestling fanatics  
by day  they transport raw sewage  
by night  particularly on  nitro monday   they pay homage to their personal hero and savior  jimmy king  oliver platt   the undisputed leader of the professional wrestling community  
with two tickets to an upcoming nitro performance  gordie and sean are psyched about witnessing the king defend his title firsthand  
but unscrupulous boxing kingpin titus sinclair  joe pantoliano  sporting long hair and cowboy boots  has other plans  
sinclair is plotting to have diamond dallas page  playing himself  pummel the king into the tarp  thereby dethroning the dignified wrestler and embarrassing him in front of a bewildered auditorium full of fans  
gordie and sean are shocked  rioting madly while arguing this isnt even a payper view event    
they take it upon themselves to track the king down and supply the encouragement essential for their fallen idol to make a comeback attempt  
along the way  you can expect a lot of sh jokes as well  
you may find something to like in ready to rumble if a  you are a rasslin aficionado yourself  or b  you are a dedicated fan of the lowest of lowbrow comedies  
i welcome lowbrow humor with open arms  that is  if its fresh and resourceful  
rumble is nothing but a sloppy  frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation  
the first halfhour is the ultimate test of patience  
luckily  the simpleminded events pick up steam  particularly with the wellchoreographed wrestling action  
director robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and excitement of football in varsity blues  and when in the ring  he does professional work  
but the violence is too excessive  
having the fake soap opera of wcw wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back unfortunate memories of owen harts tragic accident just last year  especially with one characters dive during a cage match  
this is not something you want a comedy to be reminiscent of  
outside the wrestling action  the lewd jokes and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to the term  scattershot  while the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity scale of 1 to 10  with brills extensive vocabulary ranging from diddly to boob and so on  
the final tally  i chuckled a few times  groaned a lot  and indulged in one spirited belly laugh involving martin landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for 105  
castingwise  ready to rumble is an odd duck  
oliver platt as a champion wrestling figure  
hes perhaps a bit chunky  but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him fatty  which dampens the blow i suppose  
rose mcgowan is fully disposable as a sultry wcw cheerleader  the nirtoest of the nitro girls   proclaims gordie   but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers goldberg  macho man randy savage and sting  among others   
wcw fans are sure to appreciate these  
others    
well  wont  
i found merit in david arquettes bountiful energy as gordie  which brings me to my finishing     
ahhh     
praise for the film  in ready to rumble  i have discovered something even more annoying than arquettes att television commercials  
now theres a low blow for you

1	"wong karweis  fallen angels  is  on a purely visceral level  one of the most exciting films ive seen in a long while  
unfortunately  wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for  
ordinarily  that alone would be enough to sink a movie  but in the case of  fallen angels   this is not so  
every shot in this film is exciting just to  look  at  
wong does really interesting things with the camera  but he doesnt allow the pyrotechnics to completely take over  as was the case with last years dismal  knock off   which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe  
ugh   
the movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives  
i cant say much more than that as i didnt really know what was going on most of the time  
in fact  it wasnt until about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish between each character  
the constantly moving camera doesnt really allow for the audience to associate with any one character  
were always kept at a distance from these people  i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters  
  fallen angels  is a refreshing changeofpace from most hollywood films  which never bother to try anything different  at least on a visual level  
in fact  id go so far as to say that  fallen angels  is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film ive ever seen  
sure  theres directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death  but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating  
but if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker  he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images  
there were far too many instances during  fallen angels  in which i asked myself   now who are these people again  
is this that first couple or the second couple   
it was impossible to keep track  
perhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which  by introducing them to us with  name cards   as in scorseses  mean streets   
thats really besides the point  though  
wong karwei has proven himself  through very few films  thats hes a moviemaker to watch  
lets just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies

0	"there have been merchantivory costume dramas with more of a pulse than  the mod squad   a selfconsciously  hip  cinematic rendering of the old tv series still looked upon fondly by so many babyboomers  
well  said  squad  certainly wont be a pleasant viewing experience for them or anybody else  maybe even the teen target audience the movie has been geared towards  
a contemporary take on this decidedly 70s show doesnt exactly seem unwarranted  but one wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on the shelf didnt transform into a fullblown case of botulism  
how curious that the film begins by defining both mod and squad  insisting that the latter is a group of people working together and then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk of the running time  
they are julie  pete and linc  reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd  exposition put out of the way so fast that youre likely to be lost from the opening moments on   and they are respectively played by claire danes  giovanni ribisi and omar epps  talented actors each deserving of better than this  
their plight involves standard copcorruption stuff  as our wouldbe protagonists catch wind of an internal coverup after their superior  reliable dennis farina  one of the best things here and gone so quickly  gets killed and framed for drug trafficking  
they pout a lot and eventually get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics that would impress the hardy boys and linda tripp but few others  
when youre supposed to be asking   whats going to happen next    
youll instead entertain thoughts like  who are these people and why should i care   
or  arent thrillers supposed to contain thrills   
not that danes  epps and ribisi dont give it a shot  
danes can do the troubled teen thing in her sleep  as evidenced by  my socalled life   but shes saddled with a mysteriousboyfriend  josh brolin  subplot so seethrough you begin to seriously question her socalled intelligence  
ditto for ribisis   saving private ryan   looney loose cannon  though at least he performs with a wildandcrazy vigor that occasionally demands attention  
but epps  poor epps  
epps   higher learning   is so shortchanged hes reduced to literally waiting around for a bad guy to chase him  
all this sloppiness can be attributed to the screenwriters  one of whom  scott silver  is also the director  
they must think that if they dress up their stupid story in such spiffy trappings  the look of the film is really quite impressive   itll somehow pay off  but this  mod squad  plods anyway  
characters are nonexistent  present are just some goodlooking young things modeling cool levis and cooler attitudes  
plot hardly escapes confusing convention  
and the one genre element youd think would be show up in generous portions  a few nifty explosions  some fights  any kind of action whatsoever  only rarely makes it to this dull gabfest  
all those quick to put down last months inept but serviceable  my favorite martian  update need to take a step back  
heres a smalltobigscreen translation that really shouldve stayed in its former incarnation   mod  or not

0	"mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival  
as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival  
it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time  
in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry  
toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart  
the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it  
something else is what he did  
the film opens with a woman  played by laura harring  about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life  
she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep  
meanwhile young vivacious betty  naomi watts  arrives in hollywood from canada  
she wants to build a career as an actress  
betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow  
she does not know who the woman is  
she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is  
they fix on a name rita for her  but are not sure if this right or not  
meanwhile local director adam kesher  justin theroux  has problems of his own  
he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else  cammie rhodes  melissa george   
these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong  
there is also a strange character called the cowboy  monty montgomery  adding to the confusion  
in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits  
a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun  
lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film  
he just chooses not to  
as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason  
there are no earthworms  but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches  
the film is a little long for the subject matter  
toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes  clearly not intended for the tv pilot  
unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers  
i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the 4 to 4 scale  
mulholland drive spoiler warning  
i have rated this film fairly low  
you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film  
david lynch is in large part a dark satirist  
most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside  
in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre  
what he does with this film is  are you sure you want to read this   
playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on  
the first 80 of the film he tells a simple multithread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout  
then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something  
the audience expectation is that they will add up  
but he has given clues that are selfcontradictory  
lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories  
in fact  the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation  i think lynch is merely playing a joke  
there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties  
mad magazine called it a poiuyt  
other sources called it a tri pronged ubar  
look at small portions of it and makes sense  
look at the whole figure and it does not  
this film is  in my estimation  the cinematic equivalent of a tripronged ubar  
"
0	"funny how your expectations can be defeated  and not in good ways  
the ghost and the darkness promised  at least  it seemed to me to promise  a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature  
what it delivered was mystery science theater 3000level material  an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters  
  get new jobs   
was one line  if i remember correctly  
at the end of the 19th century  col  patterson  val kilmer  whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr  is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda  
he is having immensely stereotypical problems  the natives are restless  his boss is a jerk  and now two maneating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off  
patterson tries to handle the situation himself  incompetently  and then turns to charles remington  michael douglas   a hunter of world reknown  or something like that   
the movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions  they should have gotten top billing and costarred with siegfried and roy  
they are nighinvulnerable  as one comic book put it  and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature  
give me a break  
the movie hasnt got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas  its just trying to find convenient ways to stall us  
even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic  
get this  remingtons big plan is to build a large scaffoldlike structure in the middle of the savannah  sit on it  and wait for the lion to show up  
he does this  and then gets knocked off by a bird  
by the end of the movie  the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand  
the acting is forgettable  
douglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow  but its nothing he hasnt done before  
kilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else  somewhere else  and the rest vanish into the cinematography  
the camera  by the way  sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent  
what did i expect from this movie  
i dunno  
some real excitement  i suppose  
a sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation  
no such luck  
i dug out my tattered copy of hemingways  the short happy life of francis macomber  and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind  
"
0	"as any reasonable human being would  i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things  
i am befuddled by fight club  
now sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later  sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later  
perhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time  
perhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink in do we truly appreciate and understand them  
fight club is either garbage or brilliant  but  at least right now  i must lean toward the former  
maybe i am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold  
but if it is  i sure don  t see it  
edward norton plays jack  a field examiner for a major automobile manufacturer  
his insomnia  coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his world with ikea furniture to  complete  himself  make him a loser at the game of life  
but when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th story window  he seeks comfort in a stranger  tyler  pitt  whom he met on a flight home  
once jack is sucked into tyler  s world  he can  t get out  literally  
they begin fight club  an organization based on brutal and bloody fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join a sense of belonging  
as the fight club grows  things get out of control and take on cult status  beginning with one future soldier who proves his worth by standing still outside tyler  s house for three days  
i dare not even begin to bring up the last quarter of the film  since that contains the twist that  explains  the pointless journey  
suffice it to say i was truly disappointed in fincher  who  s previous two films  se7en and the game put him in a very slim category of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation  
this is not to imply by any means that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces to the table  
but with fight club  he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments and selfreferencing film elements  such as talking to the audience about what they are seeing  telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that a slightly altered recurring line is good  flashback humor   
now  throughout the film  s coarsely woven texture and overextended plot lines  fight club is obviously trying to make various social comments about the state of the world today  
advertisements  interoffice politics  corporations  you name it  it  s addressed  
  though the media are suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced   
all of them play an important role  
how so  
well  i can kinda just tell  
i can  t really put my finger on it  
to say that starbucks and barnes  noble are taking over their respective markets and kicking out the small business owner is no big news  
is that bad for the world  
probably  
not much room for social commentary there  
we all know that interoffice politics are just that    politics  
so what was the point of all this  
the film seems desperate to make a point  or a number of points  but i couldn  t figure out what they were  
all i saw was a very bizarre social satire that was woven with strange film techniques  a bleak visual design and some fine acting  
  pitt  carter  norton    all of them are good  
even meatloaf is good   
when you get to the end  you will most likely be filled with questions  many of which the filmmakers wanted you to ask of yourself  
not them  because each of them would likely give you a different answer  
fight club means what you want it to mean  i think fincher just gives you the stuff to think about  
but it couldn  t be more bizarre and unappealing  
sure  it had shock value  but so did se7en and the game  and they were significantly stronger films

0	"come on hollywood  surprise me  
stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue  sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset  
the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls  
personal  because his niece is one of the victims  
its a slobbering psychopath  of course  but this time theres a twist  
freeman notes that each of the young women whove disappeared are all strong willed  assertive  and more successful in their careers than the average girl  
we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova  whose aim is to  dominate  these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem  
anyway  one of the women manages to escape  ashly judd  and teams up with freeman to    well  
you know the rest  
a brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs  with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants  may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story  
perhaps  but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue  
so lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further  okay  
and as for comparisons to seven    oh 
please  
kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass  
maybe the novel was a stinker to start with  but whatever the case  its the writing thats clearly at fault here  
one  these characters have very little to say thats engaging or interesting  
two  the script has no sense of humour  
three  while the notion of a psychos victims being smart  successful women is an interesting twist  the execution isnt even half as good as the idea  
thus  ashly judd comes across all out of focus  instead of being the heart of the story  
we cant feel her rage  
some atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that shes the nobullshit 90s type  but these conversations barely register  
and as for freeman  kiss the girls is his second dog in a year  first chain reaction  now this  
for an actor of his calibre  this is most worrying  
young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fictionesque things to do in denver when your dead  
but what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this  
not much  and you can hardly blame him  
theres a few wellstaged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls  dives and jumps  and the effect is startling  
but the script is beyond rescue  
what hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe  safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up  
complacency rules  its been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters  real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue  
the only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket to the movie was a freebie  positive proof that the best things in life arent free

0	"arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts  since the late 80s  but lately his films have been very sloppy and the oneliners are getting worse  
its hard seeing arnold as mr  freeze in batman and robin  especially when he says tons of ice jokes  but hey he got 15 million  whats it matter to him  
once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster  that cant compare with the likes of the terminator series  true lies and even eraser  
in this so called dark thriller  the devil  gabriel byrne  has come upon earth  to impregnate a woman  robin tunney  which happens every 1000 years  and basically destroy the world  but apparently god has chosen one man  and that one man is jericho cane  arnold himself   
with the help of a trusty sidekick  kevin pollack   they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world  
parts of this are actually so absurd  that they would fit right in with dogma  
yes  the film is that weak  but its better than the other blockbuster right now  sleepy hollow   but it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film  
anyway  this definitely doesnt seem like an arnold movie  
it just wasnt the type of film you can see him doing  
sure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known oneliners  but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going  
its understandable  especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources  
aside form that  he still walked through it  much like he has in the past few films  
im sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days  
speaking of action  where was it in this film  
there was hardly any explosions or fights  
the devil made a few places explode  but arnold wasnt kicking some devil butt  
the ending was changed to make it more spiritual  which undoubtedly ruined the film  
i was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred  but once again i was let down  
i also dont know why the film took so long and cost so much  
there was really no super affects at all  unless you consider an invisible devil  who was in it for 5 minutes tops  worth the overpriced budget  
the budget should have gone into a better script  where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom  
its pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into a movie  
do they even read these things anymore  
it sure doesnt seem like it  
thankfully gabriels performance gave some light to this poor film  
when he walks down the street searching for robin tunney  you cant help but feel that he looked like a devil  
the guy is creepy looking anyway  
when its all over  youre just glad its the end of the movie  
dont bother to see this  if youre expecting a solid action flick  because its neither solid nor does it have action  
its just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing  due to a strategic marketing campaign  
save your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience

0	"whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask  
i have been a fan of both the original series and its recently retired followup  as well as the even numbered entries in the film series  
however  i have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs  data  
somewhere along the line  the  star trek  film series began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category  and star trek  generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction  
its production values may be high  but the writing is frequently appalling  and instead of a script has a collection of references  injokes and illdefined characters  
generations opens in the late 23rd century  where members of the original enterprise crew  including captain james t  kirk  william shatner   are present for the christening of the latest ship to bear that name  
no sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them to the nexus  a mysterious ribbon of energy  
among those rescued from the nexus is longlived alien dr  soran  malcolm mcdowell   but he is nonetoopleased at being back in the real world  
seventyeight years later  soran is still trying to get back to the nexus  and again encounters an enterprise  this one led by captain jeanluc picard  patrick stewart   
sorans plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet  and the only hope for saving 230 million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains  
i dont think it is an insult to fans of  star trek  to suggest that to a certain extent  the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements in a  trek  film  
its about a chance to visit with old friends  and if they are involved in a truly interesting story it can be considered gravy  
but even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent  and in generations that just doesnt happen  
data  brent spiner  is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing  
in the films major subplot  data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions  a chip he has had in his possession for over a year  
what is his motivation for taking this drastic and perhaps dangerous step  
he doesnt get a joke  
once the chip is in place  spiner gets to have a lot of fun with datas new emotions  but the point is that hes no longer the data we know  
if the rest of the  next generation  cast fares any better  its only because theyre on the screen so little that theyre simply window dressing  
but then again  this story isnt really about the new crew  
its about kirk and picard  the cowboy and the politician  sharing the screen  
the huge surprise is that william shatner blows patrick stewart away  
perhaps because he knows this is his last goround in the part that made him a legend  shatner looks like hes having the time of his life  stewart  on the other hand  borders on the deferrential  and is saddled with the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast  
stewarts edginess is indicative of what may be a very bad sign for paramounts hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was  these are clearly the not ready for big screen players  
by contrast  the prologue which features scotty  james doohan  and chekhov  walter koenig  is the highlight of the film  
these characters have become part of the popular mythology  and when they take over the enterprise in a moment of distress  its a moment of high energy  
only thirty years of history can create a moment like that  and thats time this new crew doesnt have  
it certainly doesnt help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again  
its also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in a shared nudge of recognition  
i wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to the  trek  universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored by what is going on  
and what a waste of malcolm mcdowell  who could have been a great monomanical villain but should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obsession  
there are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to pick at  but to do so would be to ignore generations major flaws  
however  i would like to make one recommendation  seatbelts  
not just for the enterprise crew  although youd think by the 24th century space travel wouldnt involve rolling around on the floor during a battle  
no  i think the audience might need them more  
this journey is one bumpy ride

1	"it might surprise some to know that joel and ethan coen  who have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as  raising arizona  and  the hudsucker proxy   made their feature film debut with  blood simple   a grim and often gruesome tale of revenge  murder  and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas  
it bears some resemblance  storywise  to the coens recent  fargo   but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here   blood simple  is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end  
the premise of  blood simple  is really just a slight variation on the standard lovetrianglerevenge scheme  sleazy bar owner julian marty  dan hedaya  hires a shifty private detective  m  
emmet walsh  to kill his wife abby  frances mcdormand  and her illicit lover ray  john getz   
things start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but  upon collecting the money  becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme  
to reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much  but what ensues is a series of bloody  and i do mean bloody  confrontations  each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening  
every act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrators eyes  but we  the audience  are made privy to the  big picture  and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person  
this aspect of the story  along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality  one gets the sense that if guns and  in one case  shovels  were not available  some of these characters would claw each other to death  are the most effective components of the film  
the coens might have done well to title the film  fear and loathing in texas   
some have labeled  blood simple as a modernday noir  but  while i am not an expert on either genre  it seems more like a horror movie than anything else  
the coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters  and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the one  relatively  innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive  
that said   blood simple  is a very good horror movie  the fear and suspense here are genuine  
the coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards  such as when a character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on a gun  discharging it as it skitters across the floor  or when a murder attempt unfolds in a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film  
that said   blood simple  is not exactly flawless  
for one thing  the motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times  i can understand that the characters had tracks to cover  or at least thought they did   but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder  
and although they at least didn  t have anyone get hacked to death with a knife  the coens also arent quite immune to horror cliches  they indulge in a prolonged deadguyseemstohavecomebacktolifebutthenwefindoutitsonlyadream scene that had me rolling my eyes  
the film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film  
  blood simple  is not quite the masterpiece of neonoir that many seem to think it is  but its a decent movie and it showcases the coens ability to handle suspense and violence in a visceral but nonexploitative manner  
i would firmly recommend it to all  coenheads  as well as anyone looking for something original in a thriller

0	"darren  jason biggs   wayne  steve zahn   and j  d   jack black  have been best friends since the fifth grade  
like the three musketeers  theyve been together through thick and thin  
but  when darren meets an attractive  but coldblooded and manipulative  psychiatrist  judith  amanda peet   the long time friendship is placed in danger  
its up to wayne and j  d  to rescue their best friend in  saving silverman   
  silverman  has its heart in the right place  but the story  by newcomers hank nelken and greg depaul  is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle for darrens soul  
based on their experience of a friend making a major marital mistake  the story is centered on the three  life long amigos  
when wayne introduces darren to judith  he doesnt realize that he has opened a pandoras box of disaster for himself and j  d  judith was once in a relationship where her boyfriend was the dominant figure until he died in a kick boxing match  
since then  she has sought a new mate  someone she can boss around and mold into her own vision  
enter darren silverman  
once they realize the magnitude of their error in judgement  wayne and j  d  try everything they can  including threats and bribery  to get judith to free darren  
nothing works until the duo come up with a plan  kidnap judith and get darren back together with the girl he called his one and only  pretty sandy perkus  amanda detmer   
the only problem here is that sandy is about to take her vows to become a nun  
things spiral out of control as judith repeatedly attempts to escape while wayne and j  d  play cupid  
the boys even bring their idol  neil diamond  into the picture to help resolve things  
thinking about it  this is a real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn and jack black  
the pair is able to elicit the films only laughs with their goofy antics and childlike behavior  
they are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor and the two are more than equal to the task  
steve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to wayne  the  brains  of the gang  
jack black has the bigguy moves of a chris farley  giving j  d  an amusing physical presence  
the neat thing is that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from stale material  
the rest of the cast doesnt fare as well  though  
jason biggs is the straight man of the musketeers and gets very little to do  though having watched his previous films   american pie  and  loser   im not sure what attraction biggs actually has  
amanda peet is caustic as the manipulative judith  
there is no humanity at all to her character as she singlemindedly strives to recreate darren into her minds image  
shes a monster that wayne and j  d  must defeat to save their friend  
unfortunately  there is no dimension to her character  
amanda detmer brings nothing  or gets nothing  as darrens one and only  
r  lee ermey  as the psychotic coach  made a bad decision taking this role  
tunemeister neil diamond gives a goodnatured cameo perf as the boys idol and savior  
production values are on par with the rest of the film  lackluster and noninvolving  
director dennis dugan has a track record for broad comedy with films like  big daddy  and  beverly hills ninja   but falls flat with  saving silverman   
the 2001 movie year has yet to provide us with a  good  film to sink our teeth into  
at least  with  saving silverman   we get a couple of funny perfs from zahn and black  
too bad that the rest of the film lacks their level of humor  
kick boxing deaths and conflicted nuns are not the makings of a good comedy  
i give it a c

starring  jennifer tilly  voice of brad dourif  katherine heigl  nick stabile  john ritter 
synopsis  this is the fourth film in the chucky series  which debuted in the late 1980s  
basically  chucky is a plastic doll that can walk and talk because it is possessed by the spirit of a slain murderer  
in bride of chucky  chuckys longtime girlfriend tiffany  jennifer tilly  dies and her spirit inhabits a female plastic doll through voodoo  
dolls tiffany and chucky get married and embark on a quest to reach a cemetery in new jersey  where a mystical gem might enable them to be humans  
the dolls stow away in the back of a vehicle driven by a newly eloped couple  so in the side plot  the couple suspects each other of being a murderer  
opinion  bride of chucky is an attempt at horror with humor  but doesnt succeed  
somehow  chucky moaning about mid life crisis  and how he should have gotten married does not make for a very scary chucky  
and tiffany harping about mid life crisis  and how she should have gotten married does not make for a very scary tiffany  
the suspenseless bride of chucky relies mostly on jennifer tillys cleavage to keep attention during the first half  and on occasional puns to keep attention during the second half  
the best that can be said about bride of chucky is that it is sarcastic

1	"i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that didnt need a sequel  
beloved by kids and their parents  respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs  that first movie remains a landmark of recent history  the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzledazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting  
if disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game  toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions  and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply   it didnt show  and as distributor and partowner of the property  at least it had a piece of the action  
toy story 2 was greenlighted as a directtovideo project  disneys standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film  
as someone who doesnt believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing  granted  they usually are a bad thing  but thats because theyre made for the wrong reasons   i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking  
fortunately  disney claimed to have been so knockedout by early animation tests that they let pixar go fullspeed ahead with a theatrical sequel  
lucky thing  too  like the first movie  this one is a joy to behold on the big screen  and technically  it improves on its predecessor on just about every level  
  from a business standpoint  the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar  while the previous films elements are shared between pixar and disney  a sign of the production houses new cachet in hollywood   
visually  the main shortcoming of this fully computergenerated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly  making them look a little creepy  
fortunately  that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie  where the secret world of toys is more immediate  and arguably more attractive  than the world of the humans who surround them  
as before  the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy  and  indeed  all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children  come to life in the childs absence  
while the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves  the real joy of a toys life is to mean something to its owner  
one of the subjects of this new film is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned  left on a shelf to gather dust  and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors  
most often  those toys are packed away in dark spaces  safe from sunlight and humidity  and often theyre not even removed from their packaging  
imagine what a chip that would put on your shoulder  and youll understand the attitudes of the collectors items that show up in this movie  
sheriff woody  voiced by a noteperfect tom hanks   the longtime favorite among andys toys who was challenged in the previous goround by the arrival of flashynewthing action figure buzz lightyear  tim allen   suffers an injury early in the film  when andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam apart  revealing the stuffing inside  
this accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys  who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy  and a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence  
those anxieties are crystallized when andys mom tears through his living room  collecting old toys for a yard sale  
and theres an ironic twist to the tale  as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum for a sizable sum  
the rest of andys toys  who owe him quite a debt  resolve to rescue him  
that this film manages to turn a box marked  25 cents  into a symbol of doom  or to make its screed against the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma  is a testament to its skill at metaphor  seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our real world into that of the toys  
operating on this level of abstraction  toy story 2 tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness  
  the worst i can say is that randy newman seems to have reserved his sappiest lyric in years for sarah mclachlan  who stops the movie cold by singing it at just about the halfway mark   
sometimes i think toy story 2 tries too hard  
theres somewhat less of the seatofthepants loopiness that energized the first film  allowing it to surprise and excite on a nearconstant basis  and more philosophizing about toys  collectors  the nature of happiness and the meaning of life  
while that leads to fewer bellylaughs  it does make way for more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys to consider their own status as commodities that move in and out of fashion  
  just dont ask why andys favorite toy is based on a tv series that was canceled in 1957   
where else in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome moment as the one where buzz arrives at als toy barn to find it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers  buzz lightyear action figures  
forget the selfcongratulatory science fiction of the matrix  this is a fundamental mindbender for buzz  and the audience shares his humility and wonderment at the sight  
here  as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish childrens tv show that originated his character  we see our protagonists come facetoface with god  
in sly ways  then  toy story 2 can be read as a film about mortality  a metaphorical consideration of aging and death  
significantly  the films very first sequence concludes with a grim shocker that had our openingnight crowd in a nearuproar  
and toward the end  when buzz and woody speculate on how long they have before andy grows up and discards his old toys  one of them observes  with an alacrity both inspirational and heartbreaking  that it will be fun while it lasts  
so toy story 2 joins the tradition of childrens stories  largely neglected of late  that say something real about the inevitable joys and tragedies of existence  
whats really striking is that both toy story films  and  to a lesser degree  pixars a bugs life  are kids movies with wit and sophistication to shame most of their ostensibly adult counterparts  not to mention whatever piece of totfriendly eyecandy is due from the disney dream factory any given summer  
it puts one in mind of the glory days of chuck jones and the old gang at warner bros  animation  
im not sure lasseter and his pals at pixar will ever operate at quite that level of purely visual invention  they love traditional narrative too much  but  boy  it makes me wonder what they might come up with next  
 directed by john lasseter  colin brady  ash brannon  and lee unkrich written by lasseter  brannon  peter docter  andrew stanton  rita hsaio  doug chamberlain  and chris webb cinematography by sharon calahan starring  voices  tom hanks  tim allen  and joan cusack usa  1999

1	"did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet  
or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extraterrestrial  
i used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher  ms  carey  
but after seeing this movie  they may have confirmed my suspicions  
as the story goes  at any time  there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth  
the men in black  mib  are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens  guardians of our beloved planet from nastytempered aliens  and secret service to the stars  
based in new york city  where weird is the norm   the mib organization gives human form to our spacefaring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed  
but to enforce the laws of earth  the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast  
they carry otherworldly technology to erase peoples shortterm memory when common folk see the mib in action  
and their best leads on cosmic thingsgoneawry are the supermarket tabloids  
little do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v  evil going on in the depths of space  
one of the aliensashuman on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious  
it holds the key  literally  to universal peace  
a giant cockroachlike alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this key  
in the wrong alien hands  flippers  
mandibles  
tentacles    it can be used as a weapon  
therefore  it must be recovered and returned to its rightful owners  
otherwise  to ensure universal safety  earth will be destroyed  along with the key  
now  its the mib who must prevent this catastrophe  
the mib agents on the case are  k   played by tommy lee jones  
he is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore  
the stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes  
he is accompanied by a flippant rookie   j   played by will smith  
but  despite this shootemup  protectearthfromdestruction premise  this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie  
and  this isnt an independence day knockoff  
rather  this is a stylishly offbeat scifi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies  that there are real aliens that live here  and that the government does its darndest to cover them up  
but to give it some sense of excitement and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe  there must be some kind of earthhangsinthebalance scenario  
yet  this movie is very appealing  
the abundance of wierdness  talking aliens  peewee atomizers  a mortician who lives for her work  and lots of yucky bugs and slimesplattering galore   is played straight  like as if this were normal  of course  we are in nyc   
it gives it a deadpan feel  which makes it all the more funnier and odder  
jones plays the venerable seenitall agent with seriousness and maturity  
smith is likeable and makes a great comic partner to jones straight man routine  
they click like dorothys ruby red shoes  
the look and feel of the movie is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld  the addams family   
this guy has a knack for gothic comedy  and successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen  
and  an appropriate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of their task without diverting attention from the human actors  
the story moves well  and before you know it  the end credits are already rolling  
the result is 100 minutes worth of fun in the form of ewwwws and blechhhs  aaaahhhs and wows  
let the men in black protect and color your world

like a hubert selby  jr  novel filtered through equal parts damon runyan and bruce springsteen  and a ton of fun  
streets of fire bills itself as  a rock and roll fable   and the description is perfect  
this is a stylish  greatlooking  and breezily enjoyable movie that feels like a hubert selby  jr   novel with a damon runyan rewrite  irected by bruce springsteen  
noir is one of the few truly american movie genres  aside from the hollywood musical and the western

her old soldier flame  played by michael pare  comes back into town to save her  but doesnt count on a whole bunch of things going askew  
thats about the entire plot  save for the spats with ellens manager  a hilarious rick moranis   an encounter with a doowop group that winds up becoming ellens supporting act  and a whole gang of other fun little touches  
but in movies like this  when is the plot important  
the movie is all style  all visuals and attitudes  quotable lines and posturing  and it delivers all those things consistently and with great brio and pacing  
no surprise that it was directed by walter hill  48 hrs    who understands this kind of macho romanticism perfectly  and has put together a movie thats a mixture of times and sensibilities  but perfectly unified in tone  
when was the last time you could say something like that about a movie  especially a movie where it seems like someone gets decked on the jaw   and  passes out  every 2  63 minutes on cue  
streets of fire isnt the greatest movie ever made  but it occupies a totally unique little niche  and enjoys the position it has  
anyone with a weakness for doowop  neon  motorcycles  rainy streets  the el  studebakers  gang pictures  lonely heroes  and a greatlooking gal giving the microphone both lungs will eat this movie up

1	"john sayles  men with guns  is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power  
the film takes place in an unnamed central american country  where the men with guns are the rulers  
most of the country is divided into tiny segments  some are controlled by guerrillas with guns  some are controlled by army soldiers with guns  and all the spaces inbetween are controlled by thieves  bandits  and terrorists  
all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness  
however  like so many central american countries  this one also features modernity  
there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization  skyscrapers  hospitals  televisions  highways  etc  but  it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land  or else they are simply ignorant of it  
the films main character  dr  fuentes  federico luppi  falls into the latter category  
one of his patients  an army general  describes him as the most educated man he has ever met  and also the most naive  
fuentes is a true liberal  a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians  
with government assistance  he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate  
this program was to be his legacy  and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea  
however  when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot  g  s  he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned  
as he travels deeper into the forest  going from village to village  the story is always the same  the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers  usually for helping the other  
when dr  fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors  she replies simply   because they had guns  and we didnt   
rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns  because others sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power  
dr  fuentes picks up several companions during his journey  all of whom are characterized by their loss  
first  there is a young boy named conejo  dan rivera gonz  lez   who has neither a mother nor a father  
next  fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo  dami  n delgado   who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities  
through his ordeal in the army  domingo has lost most of his selfrespect  and defines himself only by his pistol  
along the way  the group also picks up padre portillo  dami  n alc  zar   a priest who has lost his faith  
as domingo is running from the army  so is portillo  he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer  and ran away from the village in which he was preaching  
last  the group takes on a mute girl named graciela  tania cruz   who hasnt spoken since she was raped two years earlier  her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her  
sayles two major strengths as a director  characters and setting  are abundantly evident in  men with guns   
  like many of his films  sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room  but a longerthannecessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor   
he creates fascinating  complex characters  especially dr  fuentes and domingo  
their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the films overarching theme of violence as power  domingos attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes belief that the revolver is unloaded  at first it is  but later is isnt   
the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself  
sayles knows how to bring a location to life  whether it be an early twentiethcentury coal mining town in  matewan   1987  or a contemporary texasmexico bordertown in  lone star   1996   
sayles is not a particularly inventive director  he likes to let his actors do most of the work  but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak   gattaca   successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain  
sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico  using all latin american actors  and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects  
the one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief  but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border  
it would not be a stretch to say that  men with guns  is a depressing film  
in fact  the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure  
in addition to loss  the main characters are also failures at something  whether that be dr  fuentes failure to change anything through medicine  or padre portillos inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being  
nevertheless  it is bleak material sayles has chosen  and he deals with it accordingly  
the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope  even in a world where  as one character puts it   nobody refuses the men with guns

1	"insane  but inspired  musical about alferd packer  the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america  
as the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer  trey parker  supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold  
throughout  packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse  a tribe of ute indians that doesnt seem quite on the mark  and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism  
parker obviously knows his musicals very well  because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film  he would accomplish this again in his postcannibal  
musical motion picture  south park  bigger  longer  and uncut   
apart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre  south park  parker and stone in their first effort  cannibal  
also offers up some pretty decent laughs  
the aforementioned ute indian tribe that packers group encounters is a definite highlight  as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen  one of which ends on a comedically deadly note   
stones humphrey character steals the show  especially when complaining about the prospect of having to eat butt or revealing whats underneath his muff cap  
jason mchughs character of mr  miller is the stand out performance though  as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings  
as i mentioned before  parkers songs are very catchy  
youll be hard pressed to get its a shpadoinkle day out of your head once youve heard it  incidentally  the braniff logo that appears at the end of every  south park  episode is scored with a few notes from this song   
other songs youll find yourself humming include when i was on top of you  a love ballad   the trappers song  the villains leit motif   and hang the bastard  the rousing finale   
thankfully  none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park  bigger  longer  uncuts songs are  
released as a pickup through troma studios  the film is available on videocassette and dvd  
the videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman  discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film  which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball   
there are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films  
as for the dvd    
well  thats a different story  
probably one of the best dvd packages of the year  and potentially of all time   cannibal  
the musical  
the dvd is a massive achievement  
presented in 1  33  1  full frame  only  the disc has the usual troma inclusions  the tour of troma  the troma intelligence test 2  trailers for upcoming releases  but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal  
specific extras  
the first thing i must note is  the transfer is about as beautiful as any ive ever seen on any disc  
the picture is crisp  clear  and free from any noticeable artifacts  
add to that one of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard  featuring trey parker  matt stone  jason mchugh  dian bachar  and andy kemler getting drunker and drunker as the track continues and you still havent scratched the surface of the extras  
theres also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film  a clip with trey  matt  and lemmy  of the band motorhead  from the film terror firmer  an index for easy location of all of the songs in the film  and finally  an index of all the songs as performed by the cast of a stage production of cannibal   
its good to see this film finally get the treatment it deserves  
kudos to the entire production staff at troma and aix for making one of the most entertaining dvds i have seen in a very long time

0	"  goodbye  lover  sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may  and one look will tell you why  
its a mess  
and thats  way  before ellen degeneres shows up  
the film is one of those torrid doubleindemnity crime stories that  in this case  required the services of three screenwriters  
i suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller  one wrote a murder mystery  and one wrote a comedy  then director roland joff  tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment  
i didnt laugh at ellen degeneres much  i think i was supposed to   
degeneres is horrible and her character is even worse  a toughtalking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair  
either degeneres is wearing a wigas most of the actors appear to beor she doesnt yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist  
every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip  but her incessant wisecracking is poorlywritten and merely stupid  
her reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is  at least she died healthy   
and thats one of her wittier asides  
degeneres sgt  
rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of    wait  
to give away too much of the plot would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triplecrosses  
its best described this way  
sultry sexpotreal estate agent sandra dunmore  patricia arquette  is married to jake  a  creative yet unfocused   and alcoholic  advertising rep  played by dermot mulroney  
sandra likes to act out her deepseated sexual fantasies and jakes brother ben  the suaveasever don johnson  likes to help  
ben is also coming on to his petite  mousy coworker peggy blaine  marylouise parker  and someone  somewhere  is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his  
the film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again  
although there are some genuine surprises  the plot twists get too contrived too quickly  
probably around the time degeneres gumcracking gumshoe appears  
at least the former  ellen  star is going for something a little different  
arquette turns in yet another of her stilettoheeled  platinum blonde bombshell roles  see   lost highway    true romance   while quoting embarrassing lines like  im not wearing any underwear   
i hope she got paid a lot of money to do this  
heres an example of some of the films flatout stupidity  
sandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the films duplicitous lovers  
she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite  the sound of music  on her car stereo  intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims  
so what was the point of the wig and the car  
  the sound of music  stuff might be a reference to  the wizard of oz  allusions in david lynchs  wild at heart   but if so joff  must have forgotten that  wild at heart  was a despicable movie  
its hard to believe that  goodbye  lover  was directed by the same person who made  the killing fields  and  the mission   
its not  however  hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long  
it should have stayed there

0	"this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground  despite some good performances from a basically competent cast  
eddie  sean penn  and maureen  robin wright penn  are a notsohappily married couple down on their luck  
living in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city  they spend what little income they have at the local bar  owned by shorty  stanton   eddies best friend  and his wife georgie  mazar   
maureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddies frequent disappearances  
on his return  he promises her the world and professes his undying love  
their manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows  as eddie disappears again  
like a junky craving the next high  maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high  
their relationship is further complicated by maureens pregnancy  
she wants the baby and the father  but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter  
during one of eddies absences  maureen is attacked by kiefer  her neighbor  who gets her drunk  with her cooperation  and then insists on intimacy  
she leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do  not to her  but to kiefer  
she lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage  
he lashes out as she expects  and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be 3 months  but in reality is 10 years  
during this decade  maureen divorces eddie and remarries a more solid and reliable individual  joey  travolta  in a small role   
her life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her  
joey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband  and father of two children  and stability  joey makes a good living  drives a cadillac  and they live in a large house in the suburbs  and the love of her previous life  
she chooses her past  and sacrifices not only her new life but her old  by giving up her and eddies daughter to joey   
but the eddie that she knew is gone  replaced by a mere shell of the man he was  
maureen is herself a mere shell  more an automaton than a woman  as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him  
perhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness  or maybe the lack of sadness  together  but the movies denouement was not convincing

1	"  id rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell   earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher  
with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister  hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story  
he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american  and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation  
from elmer gantry on  we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church  
well  think again  for the apostle  which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade  does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister  and by implication all  the rest of organized religion  
instead it gives us a highly devout man  who certainly has his foibles  but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god  
and arguably just as surprising  the goodspirited film is no comedy  even if it does have humorous moments  
instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures  
when in the privacy of his attic  robert duvall  as texas preacher euliss  sonny  dewey  argues sternly with his lord  the scene shares a kinship with emily watsons character crying out for her god in breaking the wavess most powerful scene  
the body of the story starts with sonnys coming upon an horrific auto accident  which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters  
with his well worn bible in hand  sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accidents dying victims  
the scowling police officer orders him to go away  and  after he has tried to work his miracles  sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lords work  
robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the films director  writer  executive producer  and chief financier  
rarely has a movie been such a labor of love  
with a white suit  peachcolored shirt and tie  and dark sunglasses  sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher  
duvall has every movement down pat  
even when he is walking down the street  the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy  
he dances and claps all the way  
sonnys churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deepvoiced black orators  but his rhetoric is always competitive  
  i may be on the devils hitlist  but im on gods mailing list   he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent  
and they lap it up  
people jump up  scream   praise the lord   
and mean it  
the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable  
but sonny is no saint  
it turns out that he has a wandering eye  which angers his wife jessie  played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett  
jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the churchs youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonnys church  leaving him unemployed  
sonny  letting his temper get the best of him  does something foolish  which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever  
the bulk of the film occurs in a small  predominately black church in louisiana  which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church   one way road to heaven  holiness temple   with an enthusiastic flock  
in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e  f  the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church  
he asks his members to tithe  but he gives all of his money  
and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks  
a man who cant stand to be still  he tells one of his friends   i quit school because i didnt like recess   
in his new town he meets toosie  miranda richardson   who  like him  has a family that she hasnt seen in a while  
his romance with the separated woman  like the rest of the film  doesnt follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies  
billy bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker  
his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of shows many surprising scenes  again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take  
although it probably couldnt have ended any other way  the movie does wrap things up nicely  
and dont miss the sweet epilogue during the films closing credits  
a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film  
the apostle runs a little too long at 2  12  
it is rated pg13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up

1	"pleasantville  1998  taps into hollywoods lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed 
  www  pleasantville  com  april 2  1999  friday  
cast  tobey maguire  reese witherspoon  william h  macy  joan allen  j  t  
walsh  jeff daniels 
mpaa rating  pg13 for sexual content and thematic elements 
genre  drama 
in my opinion  
in short  it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film  one can easily be misled as to what the real message is  
review  in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population  there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life  such as rain  fire  or emotions  
the town of pleasantville has one adjective  pleasant  
there is no sadness  no fear  no danger  no discomfort  no love  and no hate  
put simply  its a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for  
j one big note however is that it is only a 50s sitcom that airs in reruns on an  oldies  tv station  or is it  
i had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed  
i found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office  
but it wasnt until months later  when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy  dollar theaters  after not having seen it for so long  that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced  
it is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some  healthy  immorality is not a world at all  
instead  the actual message  which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of  is that a world without immorality doesnt give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself  because everything is automatically right  
there is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made  no space for growth  and never anything new to learn  and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story  
now im not saying thats necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted  but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be  
besides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews  this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch  
the visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable  
after spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white  its hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more  
a truly intelligent addition to it all  however  is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork  
that said  the plot goes as such  
david and jennifer are two very 90s high school twins with the typical  relationship  outline of dontmesswithmylifeandiwontmesswithyours  
they demonstrate the wellknown teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today  
david is the shyer  subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv  while jennifer is the wild  licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation  
but when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters  they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home  
nevertheless  jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life  and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home  he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed  
and  as said earlier  not to flip the town around into some corrupt society  but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them  
not only were difficult choices being brought upon the town  but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place  
people got hurt  
they cried  
they became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves  and thats when their physical world turned colors as well  
this can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie  but to me the message is finally clear  
i hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past  and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run  well never know what we could have done better  
until the next great movie i see  i remain sincerely  danielle flynn  imr

1	"theres a moment in schindlers list when a number of jews are trudging through snow  clean and crisp  dark edges and frost on the ground  
one girl waltzes through  wearing a red dress that stings the eyes  
it is probably the finest moment through out the film  
when i first saw it i began to cry  though i could not say why  
this landscape is the setting of many small moments that add up to one big whole  
when one man is shot in the head we see blood oozing out onto the ground  so black and murky  its almost pomegranate red  
at another time we follow a young boy as he runs  searching for a hiding spot before finally squeezing into a toilet  which is already occupied  
like so  citizen kane  fargo  the godfather  the godfather part ii  greed   many of the greatest american films  schindlers list plays with the concepts of money  power  and soul  
but this is a movie about a man who does the right thing  
starkly emotional  and brutally powerful  schindlers list strips away everything on the outset and leaves us ony feelings  
the following that it has gained is not suprising  this is probably  thus far  the best film of the decade  
steven spielberg has always been a skilfull filmmaker  his assured hand churned out both jurassic parks  jaws  the indiana jones films  and e  t  
 but it wasnt until 1993 that we saw what a brilliant man he can be  
the product of his genuis is really something to see  it can bring tears to your eyes just as it uplifts you  
throughout  we sense the deep control which he so masterfully spreads  
we watch oskar schindler  liam neeson  grow from an arrogant  self important man who hires jews only to save money into a moving figure  with a deep sense of pride and accomplishment  
the film requires much work  and can be a harrowing experience  go expecting a quick entertainment and youll be bitterly dissapointed  
it does reward the patient viewer  
this is a mature spielberg  and his deft hands shape an absoloute masterpiece  
this eqsuisite  beautiful film is a rare gem  
it does a good job of summarizing why i love movies  
it leaves one breathless  uplifted  and with much to think about  
afterwards you can reflect on individual images  visions  and people  
laconic  removed  schindler strides through the film a detached prescence who watches all  does much  and leaves feeling as if he could  should  have done more then he did and was able to  
the change seems natural  in the hands of a lesser filmmaker  it would be crude and would cheat the audience  
instead we are told a tale  told a story  
the film is punishing to watch  yes  
but anyone who allows themselves to get involved will experience a miracle  and a genuine masterpiece of a movie

0	"sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things  and  pushing tin  certainly features some name stars who are going places  billy bob thornton  cate blanchett  angelina jolie  and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first  but hes actually the  veteran  among this quartet of finelooking people  
sometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has  hip comedy  written all over it  compensate for workmanlike but uninspired direction  compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits  compensate for clich  d characterizations  compensate for embarrassing  you have to be joking  situations  
etc  
in  pushing tin   thornton  blanchett  jolie  and cusack dont have an earthly  
from the opening sequence the film is in big trouble  squiggly   quirky  credits  fakelooking passenger planes circling new york  and anne dudleys inyourear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for  the full monty   let alone won it  
but i  for one  wasnt ready to walk just yet  
so quickly we descend into a tightlyedited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters these people have a difficult job  yes  what with their frantic  mileaminute instructional personas  juggling planes and passengers lives like some huge  real  midair video game  
hip  cool  demonic auctioneer nick  the zone  falzone  cusack  is the best in the biz  
of course  
until some hipper  cooler  leatherclad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell  thornton  shows up to challenge falzones finite air space  
boys will be boys and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding  then the macho oneupmanship begins  
it doesnt stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within a cats whisker of each other  
oh no  
there are some broken hoop dreams  some wannaseehowfasticandrives  and then the ultimate showdown  was that my wife i saw you with last night  
director mike newell   four weddings and a funeral   must have read a different draft of this script because the one thats being acted out up there between newark  jfk  and la guardia doesnt have an ounce of subtlety  and newell has made some awfully goodand funnymovies before  
the antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe  
theyll make you frown in disbelief  
theyll have you constantly looking at your watch  
but wait  
theres still 100 minutes to go   
the films only saving grace is blanchett  whose connie falzone is a spunky  brash  long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes  
this is a wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played a redheaded australian gambler   oscar and lucinda   and a tempestuous british monarch   elizabeth    
but shes not enough to save the picture  
thornton looks terrific and performs solidly but his character is a joke  
jolie  as russells knock em dead wife  isnt bad  but the upandcoming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed like a plaything  
cusack cracks gum  dons shades  and acts hip throughout but  like everything else in the film  his performance is forced  
in the last ten minutes or so  for some inexplicable reason  things start coming together and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been  like the trailer teases  
but its too little too late  
a fine cast aside   pushing tin  is nothing more than an embarrassment

0	"from a major league baseball radio broadcast  featuring playby play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown  with special guest commentator james berardinelli  
hc  as we go to the top of the 8th  were joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli  whos here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie  major league  back to the minors  the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors  
nice to see you  jim  
as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer  can you give us the scoop on the new flick  
jb  my opinion  the producers should have stopped while they were ahead  and that was nine years ago  
one entry was definitely enough  and im surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2  this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released directtovideo  
its worse than a mediocre madefortv feature  
i should also mention that this movie likely wont play all that well in cleveland  
now that the real indians are perennial contenders  they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks  
actually  most of the action involves the twins aaa minor league club  the buzz  rather than the actual major league franchise  
hc  sorry to interrupt  jim  but we still have to do playbyplay for the game on the field  
leading off this inning is john warren  
he steps into the batters box and takes kents pitch low for ball one  
wh  so  the storys strictly minor league  right  
whats it about  
jb  scott bakula  the guy from quantum leap  plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell  
when twins owner roger dorn  once again portrayed by corbin bernsen  needs a new manager for his aaa team  he offers the job to gus  who is now faced with two daunting tasks  turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson  played by walt goggins  for a promotion to  the show   
with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano  dennis haysbert   rube baker  eric bruskotter   and isuro tanaka  takaaki ishibashi   gus gets the buzz on the right track  
in fact  he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the bigleague club  leonard huff  played with overthetop relish by ted mcginley   
soon  dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus overachieving group against huffs overpaid  lastplace bunch  
wh  can we guess who wins  
jb  the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when youve already seen the box score  
on top of that  none of the mockups are presented with much flair  
theyre not just boring  theyre lackluster  
but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension  theyve been about using baseball situations to generate laughs  
hc  warren fouls off a fastball  
1 and 1  
wh  are there lots of yuks in this one  
jb  not one  from start to finish  
i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny  
okay  a lot of the jokes were sophomoric  but they made me laugh  
the two sequels havent just been stale  but their humor quotient has been abysmally low  
even bob ueckers oncesharp oneliners have turned lame  and theyre the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing  
hc  heres the 11 pitch  
looooooong drive  fair or foul  foul ball  
the count goes to 1 and 2  
wh  does the film at least get the baseball details correct  
jb  yes  
there arent any glaring errors like there were in one of the bestever baseball movies  the natural  
but id gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story  believable characters  or even a little genuine humor  
heck  the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league  back to the minors  
wh  its nice to see old friends one more time  isnt it  
like cerrano  tanaka  and dorn  
jb  depends on whether you really care that anyone is back  
there arent any real characters here  just an assortment of cliched oddballs  
yeah  the voodoo hitter  the catcher who cant throw back to the pitcher  the japanese player  and the conceited playerturnedowner have all returned  but who really cares  
they have no depth  
notable absences include tom berengers veteran and charlie sheens  wild thing   
we dont really miss them  though  
hc  breaking ball  low and outside  
2 and 2  
wh  so youre saying that we should give this one a miss  
jb  thats right  
to use baseball terminology  its a threepitch strikeout  
if youre looking for a good movie that involves baseball  try popping the natural  field of dreams  bull durham  or even the first major league into the vcr  
actually  this is an oddlytimed release  since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters  
even the minor league seasons are already underway  
dont bother with major league  back to the minors  
its a wretched time waster  
wh  thanks for the advice  
jb  youre welcome  
hc  and heres the 22 pitch  
fouled back  right into this booth  
hey  jim  heads up  
oops  
somebody better get him some ice for that  
he may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies  but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls  
odd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him  almost as if he has a grudge to settle  
anyway  back to the action on the field

0	"my giant is two movies for the price of one  but neither is worth the cost of admission  even if you get in free  
as lamely directed by michael lehmann  the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book  
   without goliath  david is just some punk throwing rocks    
languidly paced throughout  the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer  the omen  meanders toward its sad ending  
since its rarely funny or convincingly dramatic  what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery  
other than a few nice visuals  theres nothing to recommend the picture  
with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally  to the original city slickers  billy crystal has shown that hes more than the worlds best oscar host  
he does  however  have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last years fathers day and this years my giant  
one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project  
surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there  
perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success  
or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movies somber tone  
the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day  
this onejoke movies single idea is to place reallife basketball player gheorghe muresan  who stands seven and a half feet tall  into as many visually striking situations as possible  
sammy  crystal   an agent currently without clients  is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max  muresan   
after throwing out constant oneliners   either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car     
sammy decides to get serious  seeing max as his meal ticket  
and although he doesnt like it  hes willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a halfdozen dwarfs  
  the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever   
after a series of missed opportunities  the comedic part of the movie is over  and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie  
we learn that maxs condition is terminal  and he will soon die  
to be fair  the movie does contain a few good scenes  all of which you can see in the trailers  
lets hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie  
my giant runs too long even at just 1  37  
it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up  
my son jeffrey and his friend matthew  both 9  gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it  
matthew pointed out that it  is not as good as it could have been or should have been   
  amen   
he went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle  
jeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was

however  the ship was still directed towards the united states  where the africans were brought to trial under murder  
in the court  various factions claim ownership of the slaves  and therefore try to seize them away  
the united states government  led by president martin van buren  nigel hawthorne   and secretary of state secretary forsyth  david paymer   try to ship the africans to spain  where an 11 year old isabella ii  anna paquin  wants them back  
the two spaniards who own  la amistad  want the slaves for themselves  
the american ship that found the slaves also wants them  
in the midst of this are two abolitionists  stellan skaarsgard and morgan freeman   who want the slaves to be free  
they enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey  who tries to free them  
through various legal proceedings  the case appears before the supreme court  where it is argued by expresident john quincy adams  anthony hopkins   
the film itself is a visual wonder  
spielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film in a dark  somber mood when appropriate  and a visual setting when appropriate as well  
at times  the film is very slow  and very methodical  
however  spielberg is not at his finest here  because the courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag  
the film is  in essence  a courtroom drama  one whose events are oversimplified  
the characterization is also weak  displaying weaknesses in building up characters such as the lawyer baldwin  mcconaughey   and especially morgan freemans abolitionist  
but spielbergs finest work in the film  the opening scene  a scene of cinques family  and the brutal voyage of the slaves to america  is altogether stunning  
it is this emotional force that carries the film  
mcconaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the africans  hopkins is sensational as the old adams  freeman is outstanding when used  spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents   and the rest of the cast is stellar  
the movie  however  belongs to hounsou  
his emotional intensity is brilliant  
spielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with focus on hounsou  and the films extraordinary power is simply captivating  
the film is flawed  for most of the supporting characters are merely cardboard  
but that doesnt matter  
the story is a gripping one  and one of extreme importance  
kudos to spielberg for finding it  finding the right men for the job  and letting the audience listen to the words of cinque  
a good job all around

0	"mr  nice guy is the latest jackie chan film  so you should know what to expect  
a weak plot  terrible dialogue  very little acting ability  but some jawdropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile  
however  mr  nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackies best efforts  and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever  
jackie chan plays  who else  jackie  
this time out  hes a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show  
not that it ever makes a difference in the plot  
there are only two scenes of him cooking  
for the rest of the film  somehow he mutates into jackie chan  supercop  
it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills    perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege  
a tv newswoman  diana  gabrielle fitzpatrick   covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo  richard norton  and a local gang of toughs  the demons  
although she only has one camcorder  somehow the result is full of closeups and multiple angles    hmmm  
shades of broadcast news    
anyway  the goons discover diana  and will do anything to recover the tape  
here lies another crucial flaw in the story  doesnt anyone realize you can copy a tape  
oh well  no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense  
as luck would have it  diana runs across jackie  and  wouldnt you know it  jackie accidentally ends up with the tape  
this leads to countless chase andor fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie  
in a move apparently designed to woo american  and other englishspeaking  audiences  the film uses english as its primary language  
however  that doesnt mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackies recent americanized releases  
strangely  many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english  and poorly too  
whether this is just a very bad case of looping  an effort to minimize accents  or a simple case of nostalgia  it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackies dubbed films  
the plot in mr  nice guy is negligible  merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons  
but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackies films  it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread  
look  if you have jackie chan playing a chef  why not use that to your advantage  
watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen  beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts  
the action is a mixed bag here  
theres really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackies films  
it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site  apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan  
the action in the film is neither jackies best nor worst  but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes  
the films gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting  
once or twice  it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence  
but to slomo jackie running  
either this is a nod to the sixmillion dollar man  or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down  
if youve seen all of jackies films and are in need of another fix  go ahead and see mr  nice guy  
however  if youre just in the mood for some good action  youd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work  such as supercop

0	"in life  eddie murphy and martin lawrence play two young men wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison  
after about an hour of watching this movie  you begin to realize how their characters feel  
fortunately  for audience members theres a chance to escape the nearest exit  
this  undoubtedly  is eddie murphys worst movie and thats an accomplishment  
remember the golden child  harlem nights  
compared to life  they look like citizen kane  
life is long  predictable  foulmouthed and only intermittently funny  
its 100minute running time feels like 100 years  
robert ramsey and matthew stones script basically consist of murphy and lawrence referring to everyone around them as  motherf    s  or  n      
s   
you lose count how many times both those obnoxious  offensive words are used  
and if that all it takes to write a script  than any illiterate jackass can sit at a word processor and compose a movie  
but  like life  it will probably stink  
to be honest  the screening audience surrounding me in the theater yucked it up  
but these were the same people who howled at all the flatulence and fat jokes as well  
life is as sophisticated as a belch  
its crude and stereotypical  
years ago  movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient  secondclass people  good for being only maids and servants  
for the most part  the lot of blacks and other racial groups have improved  
but a new  more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies  
in many recent films  through actors such as murphy and chris tuckers  blacks are presented as fasttalking  conniving  scam artists or hiphop  guncrazy  sexcrazed youths  
both sets of caricatures are demeaning  
and the fault does not rest with the actors  
they have to eat  too  
it is with the people who write the scripts  the studios who greenlight the projects and the audiences who accept these portrayals without protest  
lifes only redeeming virtue is the artistry of makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly ages murphy and lawrence into 90 year olds  
otherwise  life is an embarrassment  a blot on the resumes of those associated with it  
see it at your own risk

1	"  say  any of you know how to madison   
 brad  asshole  majors  barry bostwick  shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show  
the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend  
in the early 70s  stage actor turned firsttime playwright richard obrien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy bmovies he had grown up with as a child  set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design  
the result was the stage play the rocky horror show  which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england  
the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later  in october of 1974  
the film version  now titled the rocky horror picture show  was released in 1975    
and immediately tanked at the box office  
whether it was because fox wasnt quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didnt quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined  but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop  
it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters  
a year later  something entirely strange and magical happened  
prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country  and it was then that a whole new audience found the film  
this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film  acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played  yelling rude comments at the screen  and just generally having a good time  
word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture shows life as the ultimate cult film was born  
for the virgins out there who are unaware  the plot centers around a loving couple  brad majors  barry bostwick  and janet weiss  susan sarandon   who come from a small town called denton  
brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed  
they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting  dr  everett scott  jonathan adams  who played the narrator in the original stage version   but their car gets a flat on the way to his home  
remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road  they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance  
the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual  in the galaxy of transylvania   who are lead by the eccentric fishnetstocking wearing mad scientist dr  franknfurter  tim curry   
franknfurter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky  peter hinwood   
as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment  brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of franknfurters mad schemes  
little do any of them know that the doctors handyman  riffraff  original author richard obrien   and domestic  magenta  patricia quinn   are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth  
going back and revisiting this film after ten years  1990 being the first time i had ever seen it   it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has  
if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release  i dont think i would have known what to make of it either  
for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie  though bad in a really good sort of way   but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film  
by the time the credits role  it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters  and one really gets the feeling that richard obrien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy bmovies his film is based on  
when i say that the walltowall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that  once you hear them  they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity  
it goes without saying that the  time warp  is the most popular song in the film  
even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song  
what those who havent seen the movie dont know though  is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment  
my personal favorite is  over at the frankenstein place   but  dammit janet  is also maddeningly catchy  
tim currys vocals on the rocking tune  sweet transvestite  need to be heard to be believed  
the finale of the film  a big floor show staged by franknfurter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets  including barry bostwick    
frightening    features no less than four songs   rose tint my world    dont dream it    wild and untamed thing   and  im going home    all of which are immensely singable  
the films true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though  
despite the catchiness of the songs  this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadnt have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show  
watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans  unless you dont mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place   
note  director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film  in the form of a sequel  resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment  which picks up with brad and janet  this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper   as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton  
the two are menaced by the evil tv station manager  also played by de young   who wishes to claim janet as his own  
obrien returned as a writerperformer on the project  as did quinn  campbell  and gray in performance capacity only   but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original  
25 years later  this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world  
as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans  a brand new special edition 2disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date  even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary   
if you are one of those people who cant get enough of the film  this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites  
in an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film  fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that itll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all  
the film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1  85  1  enhanced for 16x9 televisions   
the film is presented in two different versions  the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called  superheroes   
for ambitious viewers  the disc also includes a hidden version  located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner  which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen  
originally  the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz  with the first half of the it seen in black and white  and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number   
most reports  including a documentary on the disc  say that the color was supposed to appear when franknfurter first shows up in the elevator  but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version  depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced  
the film contains a commentary track by show creator  and faithful handyman  richard obrien and costar patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable  and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and halfnaked on freezing cold sets  which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews   
the two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell  but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore  and there are quite a few   
fox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments  
the first feature  and the most simple  is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is  
the second feature is an audience participation track  which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show  
most of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off  but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter  
the final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd  where a pair of lips will appear onscreen during certain scenes of the film  mostly during the musical numbers  that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote  
when selected  you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world  
once the segment is over  you are deposited right back into the film where you left off  
the first disc also contains a few dvdrom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player  
there is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation  a video jukebox  a you dont know jackstyled trivia game  which is about as bare bones a you dont know jack parody as it can be   and a bizarre madlibs styled word game known as riffraffs story lab  
links to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvdrom portion of the disc  
the second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras  
former literock video channel turned music historians vh1 have allowed some of their outtake footage from the  behind the music  rocky horror  special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here  as well as a popup video for the meat loafsung  hot patootie   
the  behind the music  segments are all very interesting  especially richard obriens jaunt through the castle  which is now a hotel   where the film was originally shot  
there are also extensions of the sarandon  bostwick  quinn  obrien  and meat loaf interviews  
as far as extras for the film itself go  there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here  
one of which is just the  superheroes  number available in the uk version  but there is also another rare musical number presented here called  once in a while   
a series of alternate takes are also presented here  but none of them are really much of a revelation  except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwicks pants   
for the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia  a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here  
rounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show  two theatrical trailers  proclaiming that the film is  a different sort of jaws    a still gallery  and two singalongs  for  toucha toucha touch me  and  sweet transvestite    
foxs special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives   youre lucky    
im lucky    
hes lucky    
were all lucky     
its not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u  s   but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format  
as with their excellent dvds of the abyss  fight club  independence day  and the sound of music  fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want  
i raise a toast to them  cue the throwing of the bread  as i cut out the lights  sit back  and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about bmovie tradition

1	"here is a film that is so unexpected  so scary  and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop  
okay  it isnt quite original  considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species  but it certainly is smart  
most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy bhorror films from the 50s and 60s  and some even become them  
however  as we learned with the 1995 smallbudget horrorscifi film  sometimes expectations can be shattered  
a lot of criticism has gone against this film  from what i have read so far  anywayyep  all two reviews   and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory  laughable pieces of trash  
but  the thing is  it isnt  
its well made  well acted  and quite intelligent  
i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film  
but the species series isnt about the lack of these elements  
its about how much it can get into one film  
and yet  behind it all  it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so  
species ii begins in the present day  though it seems to be an alternate universe  
many films  especially scifi ones  create similar timelines as our realistic one  but change it to fit the films needs  
species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft  the excursion  landing on the surface of mars  
aboard is patrick ross  justin lazard   a very bright and very handsome astronaut  
patrick is the son of senator ross  james cromwell   who just wants patrick to succeed  
well  it would seem that he has succeeded  
landing on the surface of mars  he is the first human being to ever do so  
of course  he isnt the first ever  
about a billion years ago  an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life  
now  of course  the red planet is cold and rocky  
no life lives on it  
that is  no visible life  
patrick  upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil  collects samples from the ground  
he takes them aboard  and puts them in storage  
unfortunately  one of the samples contains a form of life  and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship  
just prior to heading back to earth  this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings  
they pass out for approximately seven minutes  and then shrug it off as nothing  because they cant even remember  
they blame it on a technical malfunction  
back on earth  patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible  
as we know from the original  this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet  
however  the children that are bred are halfhuman  as their father is  
patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with  and he finds it in eve  natasha henstridge   
eve was cloned from dna taken from sil  the original alien  
however  this time around  most of her  alien  urges have been either decreased dramatically  or lie dormant  
the project is led by dr  laura baker  marg helgenberger  reprising her role from species   and her motives seem respectable  
since she was involved with the original alien attack  she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again  
and it has  
storywise  species ii is much stronger than its predecessor  but it is also much stronger than  say  aliens  hey  i love the film  but you cant tell me it was strong on story   
what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay  
in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college  we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles  
this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars  later  it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it   
the script uses this effectively  but also manages to provide a wellbalanced plot  
beginning with the first man on mars  something i have always dreamed of seeing   i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie  
and it does it quite well  
the characters are all smart  and they know what to do and what not to do  
the only character that seems a little cliched is the general  george dzundza   and yet  he remains logical in everything he does  
there are the obvious flaws of course  mostly lying in the technical aspects  
the special effects are only mediocre  and some are just plain bad  
but for the most part  they remain believable  i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children   
also  the most realistic ones are usually the goriest  ranging from people being torn open  or someones head being blown off  
however  some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience  including a menage a troi that is all but necessary  
many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex  nudity  and gory violence  
however  i tend to disagree  
what were the alien films about  
and  if an alien species ever did come to earth  and their sole purpose was to destroy us  wouldnt you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible  
my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store  
i didnt realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with  i just assume it is his parthuman side looking for the most beautiful one   
the acting is quite good for this kind of film  
it is a vast improvement over the first film  at least  
the acting is the key element to this film  if it was bad  it would have lowered itself into camp  if it was good  it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens  
okay  so it isnt that good  
george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting  as his overthetop impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting  
natasha henstridge is limited this time around  as she is usually enclosed in a cage  
however  she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent  
oh yeah  and shes quite fun to just plain watch  
marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around  and her performance is probably the best in this film  
michael madsen is soso  but he isnt annoying  and he soon becomes rather appealing  with his nice cynic personality   
james cromwell has a small part  but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor  
as i say  any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability  
mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance  and he gives the film a more downtoearth feel  
and  of course  justin lazard  
lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance  but i think he is effective  
sure  he is wooden  but isnt that what his character is like  
the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done  due to the couples acting  
species ii is rated r for strong sexuality  scifi violencegore and language  
this is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see  
more than likely  they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives  
hell  i dont even know if i will  
what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year  
i probably wont see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while  
director peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful  and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series  
medak has also mastered the wonderful  jump   
moments  and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film  scream still has the first   
strong acting  smart dialogue  intelligent plotting  and a surehanded director  species ii is exactly what these films should be  entertaining  
"
0	"ive heard it called  jaws with claws  and thats a fair summation of the plot  though that tag line does little to quantify quality  
director stephen hopkins  blown away  predator 2  and screenwriter william goldman  maverick  misery  would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature  based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build a bridge to the 20th century  
theyve stacked the deck with two big stars  val kilmer  michael douglas   a bigger production design  beautiful photography  by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond   and a score so overblown that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music  
the movie doesnt make a lick of sense  though  either as an epic or as your basic boofest  
in fact  some of the bits are so laughably ludicrous that you may think youve stumbled into the sequel to mystery science theater 3000  the movie  
how about the three guys with rifles  who trap a lion and then cant even hit the damned thing  
or the hamonwry acting of michael douglas  who chews more scenery than the animals ever do   
or  my favorite  lions so agile that they can even climb onto rooftops    
"
0	"writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard  
harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun  
harder than building a bridge over troubled waters  
and incidentally  a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review  
thrillers are all variations on a theme  
you have a smart  resourceful  and powerful bad guy  who has a goal he has to meet  
you have a noble and brave good guy  who has to protect the innocent  kill the bad guy  and not get killed himself in the process  
the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner  
this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest  high noon  or silence of the lambs  or big summer blockbusters like men in black  the fugitive  or air force one  or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds  event horizon  kull the conqueror     
is anyone else getting depressed here  
point is  its not enough to follow the formula  
youve got to throw in something extra  something good and new and better than the last version  
something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals  
this is a hard thing to do  but it is absolutely necessary in every way  
without that something extra  whether its a great plot or a wellwritten screenplay  or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs  the movie fails  
thats why the jackal  with all its starpower  with all its budget  with all its hype  gets a big fat f  
bruce willis is the bad guy  the jackal  a legendary killer for hire  
richard gere is the good guy  a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal  
the jackal is trying to kill someone  
gere is trying to stop him  
will gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal  
  ill give you three guesses  and the first two dont count   
there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal  no moment when you say to yourself   i wonder what happens next   
the script for the jackal isnt ripped straight from todays headlines  
its ripped off  straight from an episode of millennium  
throughout the movie  we learn what the jackals plans are and how he intends to accomplish them  
no surprise  
the fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackals plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy  
instead  we get two  count em  two  scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackals plan just as if hes frank black  or more likely  just as if hes been handed a copy of the script   
and we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight  
its like geres character is psychic  but neither he nor the fbi  or the screenwriters  seem to know it  
and just like in millennium  the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about  whether or not they are important to what hes trying to do or not  
whats more  in the last half of the movie  the jackal  supposedly a supersmart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake  comes down with a major case of the stupids  
as for the performances    
bruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without a wisecrack  which is a major achievement  but not enough reason to see the movie  
his disguises are good  but not as good or as interesting as val kilmers in the saint  
richard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent  which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance  
sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie  not that his performance is bad or anything  its not  but it is sad that hollywood wont use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent  shoot to kill  sneakers   
writing a good plot and a good screenplay  like i said  is hard  but it can be done  
it wasnt done here  
it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones  
do not go see this movie  
youll only encourage the producers to make more just like it  
instead  stay home and rent day of the jackal  or in the line of fire  or a fire safety video  for crying out loud  
anything other than the jackal  which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones of other  better movies

1	"susan grangers review of  hearts in atlantis   castle rockwarner bros   
timing is everything  and the timing just seems right for this poignant psychological drama that combines the comingofage nostalgia of  stand by me  with the mystical power of  the green mile   
based on stephen king stories adapted by screenwriter william goldman and directed by scott hicks  its set in 1960 in harwich  connecticut  where fatherless 11 yearold bobby garfield  anton yelchin  lives in a boarding house with his resentful  selfcentered mother  hope davis   
hes devoted to his neighborhood friends  mika boorem  will rothhaar  but his pivotal relationship is with a strange  new tenant  ted brautigan  anthony hopkins  who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gift and hands him  instead  a library card  
knowing hes longing for a schwinn bike  ted offers to pay him 1 a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for signs of the malevolent  ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his special powers  
the story structure consists of one long flashback  framed by the present  featuring the adult bobby  david morse   minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins mysterious character is genteel  sensitive and benignly seductive  
the only explanation is that hes a psychic who is wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists and even that seems appropriate  given the inexplicable state of the world right now  
the production values and performances are solid  particularly hopkins  arguably the finest  most versatile actor of our era  and the children with whom he forges a firm bond  
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10   hearts in atlantis  is a wistful  enigmatic 8  evolving with subtle power to an emotionally effective catharsis

newman  sarandon  
hackman  
with an alist cast of oscar laureates like that   twilight  would seem very promising  
however  the script is tired and predictable  
it would serve well as a tvmovieoftheweek  possibly with some 1970s detective hero reprising his role  
the appeal of the project for its stars and its director  robert benton  is nostalgia  
  twilight  wants very much to be a 1940s film noir with alan ladd or dick powell  
all of the standard tropes are here  a hardboiled p  i  
among the rich and beautiful whose glamour hides sinister secrets  a femme fatale who tempts and confounds the hero  shadowy figures shooting from doorways  dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn  cops dogging his path and interfering with his investigation  
the script offers little originality  and coauthors benton and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in 1948 is a clich  in 1998  
elmer bernsteins score is hauntingly melodic and could have been drawn notefornote from a vintage noir  
the lead actors try hardnone of the three has every made less than a full effort  even when burdened with a bad script  
they try to invest every line and gesture with meaning  and they create a convincing sense of the relationships between the main characters  
harry is fond of jack but is in love with catherine  
jack is dying of cancer and is jealous of harrys love for catherine  
catherine teases harry and enjoys his attention  but her real feelings are hidden beneath a carefullymaintained veneer  
  twilight  wants to be characterdriven like  nobodys fool   also directed by benton  also starring newman  based on a novel by russo  was  but the tired script gives the actors too little to work with  
  twilight  also squanders a fine supporting cast  stockard channing  harrys friend on the police force   reese witherspoon  jack  catherines bratty kid   giancarlo esposito  the humorous sidekick   john spencer  harrys nemesis on the force   liev schreiber and margo martindale  the blackmailers   and james garner  a cop who bailed movie stars out of trouble

0	"have you ever been in an automobile accident where youve miraculously walked away with only a few scratches  yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable  mangled wreck  
well  that has never actually happened to me and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation  
but after watching this inane exercise of a movie  i certainly feel that ive miraculously walked away unscathed after a twohour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond  
oddly  eye of the beholder   which is a psychologicalromancethriller  starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent  called the eye  ewan mcgregor   working in washington dc  
in the humorous opening scene  he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down  
using an array of hightech surveillance and communications equipment  he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office  
the law firms employees get a good chuckle  
the audience gets a good chuckle  
the eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman  ashley judd   
there is something compelling about this mysterious woman  
despite her glamorous looks  however  we learn that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that get too close to her  
after the murders  she sobs while singing the christmas tune little bluebirds and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago  
after each killing  she puts on a different wig  assumes a new name  and then makes her way to another state  
the eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions  
but he does not alert the authorities  
he somehow empathizes with her sense of loss  
the eye  it turns out  also is haunted by his past  
his daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life  
his tormented psyche creates a ghostlike image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation  
she becomes a sort of spectral adviser  and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman  
he now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation  
it doesnt matter that he has witnessed all of her murders  
and it doesnt matter that the eye is abnormally reticent  hiding his entire life behind computer screens  
he follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble  
when a crazed druggie  jason priestley  attacks her  he shows up for some quick butt kicking  
when the police are closing in to arrest her  he provides a distraction so that she can escape  
all the while  the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight  
peculiar  
how bad is this movie  
i refer you to my review quote source litmus test  
just take a look at the fullpage ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes  
for this movie  they are from magazines called flaunt and mirabella   
no doubt  they were impressed with judds series of catwalks and disguise changes  
the major problem with eye of the beholder is that the film jerks forward  always unsure of its ultimate destination  
if it was a thriller  there was little to keep us entranced  
if it was a love story  there was absolutely no emotional pull  
completely disjointed in structure  its only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial  the one where the 6 on the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on a childs train set   
i am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find a serious role to showcase her potential talents  
beyond that  the film is hopelessly outofcontrol and is in need of seriously better traction and handling

0	"it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable  
the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed  
it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers  james horner  
what i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995  
what drags braveheart down is its screenplay  
it abounds with high production values  john tolls awardwinning cinematography  which also graced edward zwicks 1994 legends of the fall   a gorgeous score by horner  and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names  
but this does not save a misguided script  
the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero  but the viewers only response to his  heroism  is intellectual  william wallace  producerdirector mel gibson  is fighting for freedom and against tyranny  so we have to root for him  
but wallaces actions paint a different story  
he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance  
though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side  the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait  in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king  
wallace speaks of freedom  but his acts point toward vengeance  
after kicking the english out of scotland  he decides to invade england  
this is evident of a  spartacus complex   and this example applies both historically and cinematically  
the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities  the film spartacus  like braveheart  has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay  
it is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film  
horners score tries to make emotional connection  but the performances and the script do not help  
gibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him  
this drags down any emotional connection to the films plot  and turns three hours into a total waste of time

1	"for those of us who werent yet born when the 1960s rock n rolled around  monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies  
from otis redding to jimi hendrix  janis joplin to the mamas and the papas  and jefferson airplane to the who  this documentary is jampacked with contagious energy  
but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending  which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves  
shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock  the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time  
sure  some have painted their faces and smoke joints  but d  a  
pennebaker  the war room  moon over broadway  surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience  
no matter who is watching  it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul  
the excitement starts before the music even begins  
a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer  she replies that she feels lucky to do so  
there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips  leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers  tries to get in touch with dionne warwick  
and when one band is tuning up  a member remarks   finally  a decent sound system   
you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isnt about vanity  its about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it  a twoway street  
this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience  
its impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain  
and while the lyrics to  wild thing  may not be all that complicated  watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love  
even if you dont recognize every band you see on stage  you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats  
the only drawback to the film is the ending  which unfortunately i must reveal  
all the other bands  big names then and still today  got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time  
in contrast  the last band on camera  a wholly forgettable one  gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time  
for a film thats only 78 minutes long  thats too large of a chunk  especially when previous acts are much more stimulating  
all in all  monterey pop is a precious  rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us  
the variety of music  as well as the beautifully shot performances  are easy to become immersed in  
if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular  this is quickly dispelled  
its almost depressing to think that music this moving doesnt get made much anymore  
instead were stuck with  nsync  the backstreet boys  and jennifer lopez  all of whom should have stuck with modeling

thomas edisons  the great train robbery   1903  was the first western ever made and  jesse james under the black flag   1923  first introduced the outlaw folk hero  
now  more than 20 similarlythemed pictures later  jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend  
the story begins as jesse  charasmatic colin farrell  and his brother frank  gabriel macht   cole and scott younger  scott caan  will mccormack  and trusty comanche tom  nathaniel arcand   after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war  return to liberty  missouri  only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown  
and an avaricious east coast railroad baron  thaddeus rains  harris yulin   is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value  aided by allan pinkerton  timothy dalton  and his infamous detectives who  back then  were just thugs who provided security  
but when ma james  kathy bates  becomes one of their victims  jesse and the rest of the guys  gregory smith  ty oneal  joe stevens  form the jamesyounger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroads supply lines  sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept  
plus theres romance  between jesse and a spunky hometown gal  lee mimms  ali larter   
working from a politicallycorrect  clich  drenched  sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers  director les mayfield keeps the action fastpaced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can  
the choppy editing hurts but russell boyds cinematography  luke reichles designer duds and trevor rabins music lend authenticity  
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10   american outlaws  is a galloping  formulaic 3  
its the wild west revisited as a date movie  
"
1	"i rented this movie with very high hopes  
this movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998  and unfortunately  was not as good as i hoped  but was still very intriguing and thought provoking  
first of all  the casting for this film is great  
tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood  
they play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly  
with a plot as unbelievable as this film  you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast  
tobey and reese  bud and mary sue parker  play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability  
william h  macy  an actor i have grown to love over the past year  turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife  a  colored  person and his friends  the  noncolored  ones  
he also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife  
he does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood  
joan allen is equally great as betty parker  the ideal tv mom  
her character is the most ambitious  
she is very na  ve  and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that  
her lack of chemistry with macy  which the role calls for  and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific  and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast  then this film would even been even better  
as said before  jeff daniels gives a bad performance  
his character displays the change going on throughout the town  yet he does not display it with enough conviction  
his character is very confusing and he is not very believable  
this film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance  
the movie is very provocative  
it challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today  
i really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up  but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing  
they demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch  but do it in a slow pace  
the only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length  
some films are not meant to be that long  
pleasantville is one of those films  
this film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it  
first  they are amazed by the implementation of color  
then they want to have it  
then they do not want to  
then the war ensues between the colored and noncolored  
this is all strung out over two hours  which was way too long  
some movies need a lot of time  
saving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time  
this film is only two hours long  and seems much longer  
length is everything in films  
if you can nail down the perfect timing and pace  you can win half the battle  
pleasantville can move at a good pace at times  but it is not consistent enough  
overall  pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days  
i went in expecting a lighthearted film about change  
i left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change  
luckily  pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences  
only if it could have done in a shorter amount of time

1	"contact is the 1997 movie ive seen the most  five times to be exact  
four of those times were on the big screen  but even on a tv  its a very impressive film  
the same cant be said for films like independance day  but thats because contact is a rare example in scifi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects  and all of us know looking back that id4 didnt offer much outside of some onetime delightful eye candy  
contacts wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway  jodie foster   a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of  merely listening  to sounds out in space  
her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age  encouraged by her loving father  ted  david morse   who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola  fl  that was  of course  before the days of internet chat rooms   
while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence  of which the program seti is an acronym for   ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on  keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive  
ellies strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist  a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young  
in puerto rico  she meets palmer joss  matthew mcconaughey   a writer examining the effects of technology on the worlds overall happiness  a one time seminary student who describes himself as  a man of the cloth  without the cloth   
despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a  supreme being   ellie and palmer hit it off  and even take the time to sleep together  
its a weak and hurried relationship  but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on  
meanwhile  dr  david drumlin  tom skerritt   who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money  is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding  
this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors  eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation  and only a one night stand to remember  
it is in this nm city where  several months later  ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space  perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science  
when the signal is closely examined  many new developments spring up  and before long  drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at  
eventually  it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega  where the signal seems to have originated   
the media swarms  fanatics go further off the deep end  scientists clamor for new information  politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take  and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality  remember when zemeckis couldnt get enough of this in forrest gump    
as if that werent enough  ellies discovery leads her to the nations capital where she again runs into palmer  
contact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs  religion  
the impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented  with no signs of bias  
arguments for both sides are intelligent  solid  and thoughtprovoking  
when palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega  of which ellie is a leading candidate   personal convictions play a more important role than love interests  
the question is  can a person who doesnt believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90 of the planet  does  believe in a higher power  
even when the film wraps up  its uncertain whether its meant to play as an advocate for religion  science  both  or even neither  and in our modern day society where  right and wrong  is only opinion  at least speaking  politically correctly    the ambiguity is an incentive  
dont get me wrong  
as much as it sounds like it  contact isnt merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film  
its a  highly  enjoyable two and a half hours  
despite its seemingly heavy issues  its not a tedious undertaking to watch this film  
the special effects are outstanding  though  warning   
highly depreciated on the small screen  
even so  some of the subtle visual effects  that will likely go unnoticed by many  are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as  scifi   
the storytelling is rich and complete  and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious  and at times  even hokey   its easily one of the best 1997 films  and one of the best scifi films ive ever seen  
this is zemeckis best since back to the future  and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated  zemeckis now has real reason to boast

1	"felix  sami bouajila   the siege   lives a contented life with his boyfriend daniel  pierreloup rajot  in the little town of dieppe in northern france  
when he is laid off from his job  after discovering the address of the father who abandoned him before he was born  he decides to journey to marseilles  in the south  to find the man he never met in  the adventures of felix   
writersdirectors olivier ducastel and jacques martineau made their debut with the musical comedy  jeanne and the perfect guy   embracing that typically american genre  
their second effort   the adventures of felix   once again borrows from america with a tale of a young man who hits the road to find himself  
felix is happy with his life in dieppe  but when the ferry company he works for falls prey to the economics of the chunnel  he is out of a job and at loose ends  
when he goes through his late mothers papers he learns that the father he never knew is living in marseilles  hundreds of miles away  
felix makes the snap decision to journey to the south  puts together a supply of  cocktails  for his hiv virus  kisses daniel goodbye and heads off on foot  
he refuses to use trains and wants to avoid big cities as he hitchhikes across france to find his destiny  
along the way  a series of chance encounters with various strangers teaches felix that family is not always made up of blood relations  
on the road  he witnesses a racerelated mugging that turns into murder and  frightened for his own safety  runs away without telling the police  
following this harrowing experience  he has his first chance meeting that begins the unconscious construction of his ideal family  
his journey brings him to rouen  and the films first title section   my little brother   where he meets jules  a young art student who becomes smitten with felix  
they steal a car and develop a chaste  brotherly affection before felix must move on  
he next meets elderly mathilde  patachou   in the chapter titled  my grandmother   and soon learns that she  too  has a fondness for the same tv soap opera that felix has grown addicted to  
she wants him to stay with her  but he must continue on his way to find his father  
in the weakest chapter of felixs road trip  titled  my cousin   he meets a railroad worker  philippe garziano  and has a brief sexual encounter before heading off  once again  toward marseilles  
he next helps a stranded lady motorist  isabelle  ariane ascaride   and shags a ride with her and her three kids  each with a different daddy  in the sequence titled  my sister   
he is torn by the inner turmoil of not going to the police about the murder he witnessed and isabelle comforts him just as a sister would  
on the final leg of the journey titled  my father   he meets an older man  a fisherman  maurice benichou   who enlightens him about the real facts of life and family while they fly felixs kite  just like a father and son  
  the adventures of felix  has a number of things going for it as we follow felix on his journey of discovery  
first and foremost is the charming performance by sami bouajila as felix  
he is a likable guy  fighting his hiv with his doses of  cocktails   and lights up the screen as he makes the long walk  often with dance and song  to find his father and himself  
as he encounters each member of his new family  promising each that he will send a postcard when he arrives at his final destination  he grows a little bit more spiritually and emotionally  
bouajila does a terrific job holding center stage on the screen  
the cast of characters making up felixs newfound family are nearly as charming as the star  each in their own way  
patachou  especially  is wonderful as the grandma character and a kindred spirit to felix  
ariane ascaride  along with her kids  gives a perf that really makes you think of her as the sister that the young man never had  
only the  cousin  chapter lacks the emotional depth of the rest and feels like a perfunctory addition to felixs  family   
  the adventures of felix  does not reinvent the road movie  but it does provide a charismatic telling of a young mans journey to find himself and  to his surprise  his discovery is dramatically different than he expected at the beginning  
it helps that cinematographer matthieu poirotdelpechs crisp lensing compliments the story perfectly as felix moves across the french countryside  
i give it a b

0	"one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles  
he has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish  and one of his best was his last film  lone star  
after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the usmexico border  expectation ran high for his next film  
unfortunately  his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for  
we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do  
then the film does exactly what it promised  a painful as that is  
the plot of men with guns can be summarized  in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas  
dr  fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went  
and he found out again and again and again   
of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell  
a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians  
but the film talks down to the viewer  
dr  fuentes  played by federico luppi  teaches medicine in the capital city of his country  
he has  as a great humanitarian gesture  trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios  
fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service  
then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy  
in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others  
the student tells him the others are still in the mountains  but suggests that it may not be a good place to be  
fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors  ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general  
the results are little different than one would expect  
dr  fuentes starts out incredibly naive  
even some american tourists  present in the film mostly for comic relief  seem to know better than dr  fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains  
but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was  
sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians  
the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences  
federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos  
damian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter  
mandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer

1	"im not quite sure how best to go about writing this review  
i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinsons political satire  wag the dog   but in retrospect  this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it  
quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through  and it didnt do that  
they also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and alltootrue attack on the way the american political media works  and it didnt quite do that either  
a few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubricks  dr  
strangelove  in the tradition of political black comedy  and it most definitely didnt do that  
that said   wag the dog  is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them  
the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean  robert deniro  to distract the american public from the accusations that the president  who is up for reelection in two weeks  sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office  
the accusations  the script suggests  are probably untrue  but as brean so pointedly puts it  that isnt particularly relevant  the scandal is likely to derail the presidents campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood  
brean  along with his assistant  anne heche   decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss  dustin hoffman  to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and specialeffects trickery to make it appear that the u  s  is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor  
as i said   wag the dog  is not quite as laughoutloud hilarious as i had expected  but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here  such as when  in an echo of a familiar movie clich   the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting  inspirational music  then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform  we have the right to fight for democracy   
another scene shows us how  with modern editing equipment  an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village  
the most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda teams attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt  
william  old shoe  schumann  woody harrelson   an exmilitary officer who turns out to be a firstclass psycho  
of course  not everything goes as planned  the cia  for example  realizes whats going on and strikes a deal with the presidents electoral opponent to report to the media that the  fighting  has ended  forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis  
still  even with the cias involvement  the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable  
regardless of the official word from the president or the cia  wouldnt the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is  in fact  no fighting going on in albania  
the film never addresses this question  nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical  such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt  
schumann  we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it  
there was also an instance  towards the end of the film  in which one of motsss forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away  
with these plot holes   wag the dog  doesnt quite work as a satire of american politics  but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place  
brean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical  rather  they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off  
the film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end  as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret  
motss and his hollywood buddies  meanwhile  seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project  
in fact  one of the sources of conflict in the film is motsss increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war  in his mind  it is the greatest work of art he has ever created  
i think its fair to say that  wag the dog  underachieves a little bit  more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a fourstar film and a classic satire  
still  the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one  
wag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks  what if the war wasnt even real  
with this premise and the talented cast  the film still delivers more consistently than most  whatever its flaws

1	"originally titled dont lose your head  this parody of the scarlet pimpernel story was the first carry on to be produced by rank film productions  
two english fops  the powdered  bewigged  beribboned sir rodney ffing  sidney james  and his counterpart lord darcy pew  jim dale  decide to travel to revolutionary france in an attempt to rescue their fellow french royalists and aristocrats from losing their heads by the guillotine  
due to a series of machinations and disguises  they are largely successful  
ffing becomes known as the black fingernail because he leaves a calling card behind which shows two fingers sticking up  one with a black fingernail  
after the fingernail rescues a prominent royalist the duc de pommfrit  charles hawtrey   citizen robespierre  peter gilmore  orders the head of the secret police citizen the big cheese camembert  kenneth williams  and citizen bidet  peter butterworth  to follow the fingernail to england and do away with him  
  in fact  darcy and ffing are their coachmen   
once at calais  the fingernail meets jacqueline  dany robin  and they fall in love instantly  
he tells her his identity and gives her his locket  
when camembert realises that the fingernail is nearby  he searches the inn at calais and captures jacqueline  thinking that she is wearing a diguise and is really the fingernail  
jacqueline is imprisoned in the bastille and camembert  his love desiree dubarry  joan sims   and bidet all travel to london in pursuit of the fingernail  
they pretend to be of noble stock  calling themselves the duc and duchesse de la plume de ma tante  with bidet their assistant  and are invited by darcy to a ball held by ffing  
desiree finds out that ffing is the fingernail by wearing the locket around her neck  but she ends up falling in love with him  
ffing attempts to stall camembert so that he can return to the bastille to rescue jacqueline  camembert has her moved to the chateau neuve  and a climactic swordfight decides who will lose their heads at the end of the film  
a more complex story than most carry ons  this film enjoys good production values  sets  costumes  and an onform cast  
sid james is excellent as the english fop and black fingernail  kenneth williams excels as the evil camembert  and peter butterworth expertly plays the substantial part of camemberts thickwitted crony  
other acting honours go to joan sims who is perfect as desiree and charles hawtrey who is excellent as the french aristo pommfrit  
although it suffers from a disasterously overlong sword fight at the end of the film  it is largely successful due to the performances of the main stars  its slick and professional production  and its betterthanusual script  
definitely one of the best of the series and a joy to watch

1	"i had a chance to see a sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night  
i went in with the expectation of a film with the similar flavor which made the original such a success  personal growth and insightful humor about life  
i came away somewhat disappointed in this regard  getting some of the latter and not much of the former  
the basic plot revolves around billy crystal  who plays mitch robbins  turning forty  
hes now become the station manager of the radio station in which he worked in the original  
hes given a job at the radio station to his best friend  played by daniel stern  out of sympathy while sterns character works through his divorce  
his loser younger brother  john lovitz  comes to mitchs house to bum a money and place to live  all while mitch and his wife try to celebrate his birthday  
during the celebration  mitch discovers what appears to be a treasure map in curlys  the cattle drive leader in the original played by jack palance  old hat  
after a business trip to las vegas  crystal  stern  and lovitz stay a few extra days to go off in search of the treasure  
on the way  they run into curlys twin brother  duke  played by  you know who  jack palance  
first of all  the cinematography was beautifully done  especially the outdoor scenes in the desert  
the scenes are such that i would like to see some of those sights filmed myself  
there is some character development during the film  
the actors remain true to their characters and play them well  without overplaying the jokes  
the movie is a good basic adventure  with enough plot twists to provide for an ending that is difficult to predict  
the movie is paced well  but with a couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end  
humorwise  the film has a good number of jokes which maintained my interest throughout the film  
there are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by a snake  but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel  surprise  surprise for a sequel  right    
however  the slight bitter aftertaste i have with this film has to do mainly with the films manipulation of the audience  
the film tries to pull your heartstrings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other  like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friends butt  
this is done again when the gang meets up with some members of the cattle drive group from the original  
there were also some parts which appeared unrealistic  like whether the stampede would start in the way it did or why they didnt worry more about water while tromping around the desert  
some strenuous stretches of the imagination are required here  
since the objective of the gang is to find gold and get rich  unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original   i also found it harder to empathize with the characters during their journey  
overall  id say that the film is an entertaining and humorous adventure with some storyline deficiencies making it less worthy than the original  
it may be worth the full price of admission  but a matinee would be a better bargain

0	"synopsis  a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boys mother  a fledgling restauranteur  
unsuccessfully attempting to gain the womans favor  he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way  
comments  stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurnedpsychosgettingtheirrevenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry  both theatrical and directtovideo  
their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that theyre typically inexpensive to produce  no special effects  no big name stars  and serve as vehicles to flash nudity  allowing them to frequent latenight cable television   
stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect  the psycho never actually has an affair  on the contrary  hes rejected rather quickly  the psycho typically is an exlover  exwife  or exhusband   
other than that  stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable  
stalked does not provide much suspense  though that is what it sets out to do  
interspersed throughout the opening credits  for instance  a serioussounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk  its implicitly implied that all stalkers are men  while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen  
after these credits  a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears  
the narrator states that  this is the story of daryl gleason  and tells the audience that he is the stalker  
of course  really  this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels  
if the movie was meant to be about daryl  then it should have been called stalker not stalked  
okay  so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts  no guesswork required  
stalked proceeds  then  as it begins  obvious  obvious  obvious  
the opening sequence  contrived quite a bit  brings daryl and brooke  the victim  together  
daryl obsesses over brooke  follows her around  and tries to woo her  
ultimately rejected by her  his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate  
these plans include the alltime  psychoinlove  cliche  the murdered pet  
for some reason  this genres films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked  
stalked is no exception  its a cat this time  found in the shower   
events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked  where only one survives  guess who it invariably always is and youll guess the conclusion to this turkey   
stalkeds cast is uniformly adequate  not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either  
jay underwood  as the stalker  turns toward melodrama a bit too much  
he overdoes it  in other words  but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands  
maryam dabo  about the only actor close to being a star here  she played the bond chick in the living daylights   is equally adequate as the  stalked  of the title  even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong  independent businessowner  
brooke  dabo  needs to be ditzy  however  for the plot to proceed  
toward the end  for example  brooke has her suspicions about daryl  
to ensure he wont use it as another excuse to see her  brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house  
does she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers  
of course not  
she tries the door  opens it  and wanders around the house  
when daryl returns  he enters the house  of course  so our heroine is in danger  
somehow  even though her car is parked at the front of the house  right by the front door  daryl is oblivious to her presence inside  
the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audiences suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either characters intelligence  
stalked receives two stars because  even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring  it is not so bad that it cannot be watched  
rated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar  it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are  
if youre in the mood for a good suspense film  though  stake out something else

0	"capsule  where are you tonight  leni rienfenstal  
starship troopers is an expensive  hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography  and bad pornography  at that  
it is not good cinema  not good storytelling  and not even stupid fun  its so cynically  calculatedly boneheaded that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed  
its one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time  
why am i calling this movie pornography  
pornography  in the abstract  is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts  
i remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie  where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper  as  a nearpornographic eternity   
i didnt agree with that assessment  but i could see what was being implied  the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout  do er  man  do er   
that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers  
its  literally  like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk  
it tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening  
the film takes place in our future  when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesnt appear to have intelligence  
to counterattack  humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable  instead of nuke the planet from orbit  which theyre clearly capable of  they send down grunts with m16 rifles  
this isnt heinlein  its a bad wwii movie  one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy  repetitive  and ultimately tiresome  
  one scene has a journalist on a battlefield  filimg soldiers being slaughtered  and ends with groaning predictability  said cameraman gets skewered  too   
the soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic  
they do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense  
they dont even behave like soldiers in a bad  movie   and therefore we dont care about them  
we hated the tom berenger character in platoon  but he  mattered   and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate  
here  we dont even hate the bugs  whats there to hate  
hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine  
if theres anything really hateful there  the movie doesnt know how to give it to us  
the screenwriter  ed neumeier  perhaps a better appelation would be  screen typist   and director  the increasingly talentimpaired paul verhoeven  have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other  
one of the subplots concerns a woman pilot whos great at getting out of tight situations  and does it again and again and again  
once or twice is fine  
by the fifth or sixth time  its worn out its welcome  
theres never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything  or really being tested to show their mettle  
also  the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry  
if a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp  then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing  
but if one human gets cornered  he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip  
uhhuh  
the very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasifascist flavor  
i say  quasi  because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action  the gear  the uniforms  etc   the movie doesnt have the nerve  or the brains  to be genuinely fascist  or intelligent about the subject  
the bumpers between scenes  which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda  just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison  
like the rest of the movie  
theres more  i suppose  but its not worth it  
the acting is bland  neither arsenic nor gravy  the music disposable  the camerawork turgid  
the heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece  
"
0	"as bad as  mimic  was  it definitly scared me  
  mimic  continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity and style  and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make a movie  
director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film  cronos   
that movie worked because it took an unconventional story  unique characters and well written plot and dialogue to create a truly scary movie  
in  mimic   del toro doesnt bother to give us anything original  
the plot is a stupid combination of  aliens  meets  species  meets  jurassic park   
the characters have been recycled from a few hundred other movies  
theres nothing new in  mimic   
its just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work  
at the end of the movie  youre stuck wanting your money back  
maybe the worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies  he forgot to turn the lights on  
i dont understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the  seven  trend and be set in dark  dank areas  
watching  mimic  i was tempted several times to yell at the screen  turn the lights on  
the switch is to your right  
use common sense  
just do it  
youll be able to see the monster in the corner   
theres a scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on and off  
it looked like the light operator was having a seizure  and sorvino didnt even notice  she just stood there looking like she was having deep thoughts  
  hmmm     
i think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight   
  mimic  has a lot of incidental shock tactics  boo  
just kidding   and follows them up with the real scare  but nothing in this movie scares you  
the audience in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments  i think they were bored  too  
i shouldnt blame del toro  
he isnt the first successful foreign director to come to hollywood and make a bad movie  
hong kong director john woo made two of the best action films of all time   the killer  and  hard boiled  then came to america to make the stupid  broken arrow   
french directors luc besson   la femme nikita   and george sluizer   the vanishing   followed woos lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies  
robert rodriguez  who directed the terrific low budget  el mariachi  came to hollywood and directed the horrible  highbudget  desperado   
i dont know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his country cant make a good american movie  
woo finally broke through and made  faceoff   but it still isnt up to par with his earlier films  
i get the feeling a hollywood producer sits in his office  chews on a big smelly cigar and says to the director   welcome to america  
i bet you must be tired after being on that boat for so long  
do you speak english  
now  i know you think youve made good movies in the past  but now youre in america  so things are a little different here  
just remember what the american audience always wants  and youll be fine  
they want to see at least one big breasted woman  characters that theyve seen a thousand times before  because change scares americans   and you always need a cheesy feelgood ending to wrap things up  
if you dont make that kind of movie  youll be shining my shoes in no time

0	"if anyone had been able in 1983 to forsee a latenight cable show hosted by gilbert gottfried showcasing some of the worst films of the 80s  theyd agree d  c  cab is the quintessential  usa up all nite  movie  
its one of those childish rrated movies that kids would love but cant see until its edited for tv  
its also one of those pointless  almost plotless movies with hardly any laughs  
and  strike three  it pairs mr  t with gary busey  
i heard gilbert say d  c  cab had  an allstar cast   but im still hoping there was some degree of facetiousness in that statement  
when thirdbilling goes to a twominute appearance by famed flashdancer irene cara  as herself   you cant say a damn thing about allstar casts  
likewise for token appearances by marsha  roz  warfield  paul rodriguez and  politically incorrect  host bill maher  before he was somebody  
appearing in d  c  cab pretty much had the opposite effect on everyone else  especially irene  im gonna live forever  cara  
d  c  cab is an ensemble comedy from joel schumacher  who would go on to direct batman forever  about a bunch of misfits who drive cabs  
you get the feeling if the police academy cadets had made a different career choice  this would be the result  except here you have such interesting characters as the  token white guy   busey  who wants to get in tight with the blacks now before they take over the world  the token jive talker named tyrone  charlie barnett  who wears his hair in rollers and uses the word  honkey  as much as possible  the tough guy with the mohawk and gold chains  mr  t  a real stretch for him   the aspiring musician waiting for his big break  maher   the mexican gigolo  rodriguez   the woman who actually wants to drive cabs for a living  warfield  and the guy who wants to own a cab company for a living  adam baldwin   
weve all seen dozens of bad comedies from the 80s  
some are fun to watch and some are actually funny  
this one is more or less neither  
youd think plenty of comedic sparks would fly from the assemblage of talent  whatever   but d  c  cab more or less falls flat on a continual basis  culminating in the usual contrived hollywood finale as baldwin is kidnapped and the other cabbies have to go to rescue him  
its a shame no one was able to rescue this movie from the depths of stale jokes and unoriginality  
d  c  cab has rightly earned its position on  usa up all nite

0	"capsule  godawful  comedy  thats amazingly shabby and cutrate  and rather bereft of laughs  
i was having a bad week in my life when i saw austin powers  international man of mystery  
i desperately needed something to cheer me up  or at least distract me so i could get a clear head  
get some perspective  
even dumb movies can do that for me  sometimes  
i tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment  but i am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day i won the lottery  
michael myers has taken a character that would barely have supported a fiveminute sketch on saturday night live and stretched it to the length of a feature film  padding it out with toilet jokes and the sort of propsstrategicallypositionedbetweennakedactorsandcamera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago  
the plot  what little there is of it  back in the swinging mod hep sixties  i dont think im doing a disservice to the movies attempted early look and feel by describing it that way   sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr  evil  
evil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later  when powers was out of the picture  
powers also had himself frozen  and he wakes up to find the nineties a very hard time to deal with  
the basic gag  that of powers total inability to cope with the nineties  is not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with  
the bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics  james bond gags  of which this movie has no end  right down to the silly character names   inept slapstick  toilet humor  and strategically placed props    
the movies amazingly bereft of ideas  come to think of it  with a couple of bright exceptions  
one is dr  evils son  there is a sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter group  chaired by carrie fisher  and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind a couch  its a visual gag  hard to describe  and hard to recommend seeing the movie for   
a lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for this movie  but its desperate rather than clever  
instead of skewering the whole thing  its a rather bloodless and unfunny tribute  
myers himself is also desperate  hes given an idea to play  not a character  
plus  the attempts to make the character work by giving him a relationship with another sexy  albeit  nineties   agent are a waste of time  
i wanted to have the movie end with him trying yet again to get it on with her  only to have her deck him one  
with a couple of exceptions  the movie misses all of its own best moments  
the movie even looks cheesy  and not in a good way  i kept wondering if it had been transferred down from hidef video or something  so grainy was the film stock in a good many scenes  
the whole thing has the air of being done on the cheap  
my definition of comedy is simply  did it make me laugh  
the few times that i laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the time i spent cringing and wanting out  
the most damning thing i could say about the movie is that wayne and garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tysons shorts and sent it sailing

1	"originally entitled dancing about architecture  i  e  
  talking about love is like dancing about architecture    but changed because it sounded too much like the recent boxoffice dud dancing at lughnasa  this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names  playing interesting and wellwritten characters  within a vignettesstyled plot arrangement a la robert altman  
plot  follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love  finding themselves  regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are  and who they want  and appreciating the fine emotional art of love  
critique  charmingly effective romantic drama  this film offers insight into various types of relationships  presents us with interesting characters and excellent performances from the cast  and scratches beneath the surface of love and its many complex subtleties  
how do people fall in love  
why do people fall out of love  
how do people fall back into love  once theyve been hurt and left to join the lonely hearts club  
all of these questions and more  are touched upon in this film  within several types of variant relationships  
meet a hip  young couple going through their first date  
a divorcee attempting to date again after her many failed relationships  
a married woman  finding herself  while cheating on her husband  
a husband letting go of his inhibitions  
an older couple dealing with a past  love  of the man  a secret recently uncovered  
a son dying from aids  joined by his mother at the hospital  
there are many nuances to this picture  and many ideas and quotes to which we could all relate  but more importantly  there is diversity  
diversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels  
some related to the younger couples issues  
others with the married  
theres a little bit of everything for everyone in here  
and i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year  i would relate myself to yet another predicament  
just like love itself  this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different levels  
the actors in this film are all also very  very good  
sean connery is solid as the older man with some issues to resolve  as is gena rowlands  as the aging wife with trepidations  
jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance  while philippe is as prettyboy as ever  
anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to reignite her love life  opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talkshow host  jon stewart  
even dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film  and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his own imagination  
the only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detached  was the part surrounding jay mohr  the man dying from aids  and his mother  ellen burstyn  
the actors were fine  but somehow  the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else  
the ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me  but i guess thats just hollywood  
this film is actually a lot like your friends and neigbors  5  510  and happiness  4  510  in concept and style  but its complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility and likeness  
the characters in those films were too unique and inhuman for anyone to care  as opposed to this film  which offers rich and believable characters  living real lives and talking about real issues in todays relationships  
all in all  this movie offers many interesting characters  talking and living genuine and engaging love lives  wonderful performances by its solid cast  too sweet of an ending  but an enjoyable and rewatchable movie nonetheless  
little known facts about this film and its stars  according to a story in the london sunday mirror  sean connery asked for only 60  000 for his role in this movie  as compared to his usual fee of 14 million  because he liked the script so much  
on top of that  he convinced his costars  including gena rowlands  gillian anderson  ellen burstyn  et al   to do the same  
this is directorwriter willard carroll second real foray into the world of  adult films

1	"  dimension films   scream 2  s distributor  has asked press to say extremely little  if anything  about the films twisty plot  
thats no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here  but i will do my best to be vague  now  theres a first    
  the first one was good  but all the rest sucked   said a cinematicallysavvy teen in last winters wes craven thriller  scream   her statement referring to the films of the  nightmare on elm street  series but really putting down franchise overkill in general  
the comment certainly carries clout  for every truly great sequel  there appears to be a couple of duds  making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas  
but like it or not  along comes  scream 2   and believe it or not  its a doozy  a slick  sinister  madly subversive good time at the movies  as intent on sending up hollywoods sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions  
  scream 2  is definitely that rare movie thing  a followup that can stand along side its original with pride

plucky heroine sidney prescott  neve campbell  is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college  her pop culturewhiz pal randy meeks  jamie kennedy  has tagged along  
trash tabloid reporter gale weathers  courteney cox  has written a bestseller based on their ordeal  the basis of which has been turned into a  very bad  movie called  stab   
and dewey riley  david arquette   still suffering from wounds inflicted during  scream   has left his job as a police officer for a while  
life is tranquil    
at least for a while  
several sudden murders bring sidney  randy  gale and dewey together again  but with suspicious eyes cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings  if these four people learned anything from the past  its to trust no one  
thus  the possible victimpotential killer list includes said quartet  as well as  derek  jerry oconnell   sidneys new beau  cici  sara michelle gellar   a chatty sorority gal  joel  duane martin   gales cameraman whos not too thrilled with her bloodsoaked past  hallie  elise neal   sidneys sassy roommate  debbie  laurie metcalf   a local reporter who gives gale some nottoofriendly competition  and mickey  timothy olyphant   randys good friend and fellow film student  
cotton weary  liev schreiber   the man sidney wrongly accused of her mothers murder in scream  also shows up on campus  but why  
like the first scream  craven and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang  
this time  its an extended sequence that finds an africanamerican couple  jada pinkett and omar epps  attending a sneak preview of  stab   making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat nonroles of blacks in slasher cinema  
before tragedy ensues at the screening  the moviewithinamovie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments  including a scene from  stab  which turns screams nowfamous drew barrymore prologue on its ear  
   b  hang up the phone and star69 his a   
pinkett yells at the screen   
its funny  creepy stuff  i dont think ill ever feel safe in a movie theater again  that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road  
another flawless example of this is a riotous cell phoneassault of the killer on randy  dewey and gale in broad daylight  it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters  
there are other superb set pieces  but explaining them risks ruining their effect  
there are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count  
its something of a tradein  the new characters are too large in number to be as fullydeveloped as the original  scream  gang  but this movie packs in knowing performances  especially by kennedy and cox  and more death for your dollar  
it can be argued that  while the original might outclass it by a tad  scream 2 is both scarier and funnier  
it certainly doesnt skimp with shocks  a major one being the killing of one cast member very near and dear to my heart  i actually questioned craven and williamsons judgment here  considering how much this person has added to these films   
sometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab  the two scenes were shown are deadon  but for film fans  there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like  the usual suspects    aliens  and  the empire strikes back   
still   scream 2  does so many things right  its petty to quibble  
its penchant for parody is irresistible  discussions of the merits of film sequels and all  
the attractive  solid cast is a definite bonus  
and the denouement  while not as shocking as  scream  s  is priceless  the films final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film prominently referred to in  scream  with one of the best bad guy motives ever put on paper  
all this and a  scream 3  is in the works  
knowing the series tendency for selfreference  perhaps one of its characters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice  
mentioning  scream 2  ll help them in their argument

0	"there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs  
one is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into a feature film  
two is never greenlight a scifi film starring john travolta  
to wit  we present the disaster that is battlefield earth  
a sciencefiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild  battlefield earth should be shown only at maximumsecurity prisons when a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior  
scifi is always a tricky beast  tight script  a good director  an ensemble cast of decent actors  and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs  
battlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes  
heres the plot   
the year is 3000  
mankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos  sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group   
a small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the demons who dwell in the cities below  
the psychlos are stripmining the earth for its resources and terel  played by travolta  is the head of security for the miningslave base located in denver  
a young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler  played with dramatic flair by barry pepper  ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the demons   
he is promptly captured and taken to the alien base  
after several attempts at escape  johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terels  involving circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end  
jonnie  assumed leader of the mining slave group  then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine terel forces him to use  
then the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry  the bill of rights  how to use a machine gun  and how to fly a harrier jet  
the whole mess concludes with a big  loud  obnoxious gunandplane battle that had me praying for the end credits  
roger christian  the director of this lumbering beast  must have rented dune  blade runner  planet of the apes  independence day  stargate  beastmaster  the airwolf episodes  the v miniseries  the matrix  and the omega man    
and decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth  
christian even shoots every scene in a weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie  
and every scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe  really  
the psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit  
travoltas acting hasnt been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect  
jonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like you can have your freedom if you fight   
then theres the script  the film just never convinces you that the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and take back the planet would be a difficult task to achieve  
why  
because terel provides all the necessary tools to incite a revolt  for no particular reason beside the fact that humans are stupid   
terel may be right  you know  
humans made this movie

0	"its been hours since i returned from the much anticipated scifi opus mission to mars  and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar  
why  
the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy  stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera  instead shooting for the angle of a feelgood science fiction drama more akin to 2001  a space odyssey  
i got the feeling that most of my fellow moviegoing patrons were expecting another armageddon  
but no  mission to mars certainly isnt one large action sequence about colossal disaster  
this is a supposedly thoughtful  familyfriendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel  
you have been warned  
of course  crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible  see apollo 13 for an excellent example   but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation  
brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off  
when he gets his hands on an intelligent  systematically practical script like the untouchables or mission  impossible  the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement  although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally   
of course  theres also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name  including snake eyes and the notorious bomb the bonfire of the vanities      
all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood  
that term may be too harsh  but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is mission to mars  my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient  
if i were gary sinise  i wouldnt touch de palma with a 10foot pole  
sinise is a wonderful  wonderful actor  but after appearing in snake eyes and this vomitinducing sham  im sure he wouldnt want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration  
the academy awardwinner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell  a man who recently lost his wife  kim delaney  and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars  oops  forgot to mention the year  2020   
after a barbecue gettogether for the astronauts  we cut to luc goddard  don cheadle  and his team  who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet  
suddenly  a towering formation of rocks and soil  probably best dubbed a sand tornado  appears and creates a whirlwind of suction  
for some reason  the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this  as if it were a lovely piece of art  
the team is killed within seconds  expect for luc  who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive  
immediately  a second mission  consisting of astronauts mcconnell  husband and wife woody and terri blake  tim robbins and connie nielsen  and phil ohlmyer  jerry oconnell   are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars  
lets put the secret on hold for now  and discuss the trip there  
it is explained  whether scientifically accurate or not  probably not   that a trip to mars takes roughly six months  
im not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind m2m didnt capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia  
instead  we join the team during their final days aboard the ship  
what happened during the five months prior to this  
did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes  
still  there are few nicely tense moments  maybe the only in the movie  during the timeframe involving a fuel leak  
depalmas direction is quite good in these scenes  although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent  organ music in space  
cmon   
theres a few good  imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese  a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud  
its a colossal bummer that mission to mars is poorly assembled and laughably written  with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists  
as mentioned before  anyone looking for some disastermovie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed    
maybe even cheated  
after the unbelievably hokey final shot  with the words  the end somehow adding insult to injury   a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen  
others muttered obscenities  shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling jeez  that sucked   
okay  it did suck  
but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy    
after all  they do pretty well  
sinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes  robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple  and funnyman oconnell  well  he has a couple lines are actually amusing  and intentionally so   
the digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive  
so  by golly  where did this mission go wrong  
looking back on the appalling experience  i would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have  
while watching mission to mars  my suggestion would be to immediately abort  or better yet  dont even strap yourself in for liftoff

0	"after enduring mariah careys film debut  glitter  im reminded of a bit from chris rocks bigger and blacker  
in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man  rock says   you can drive a car with your feet  but that dont mean it should be done   
to that i say  you can give mariah carey a movie  but that certainly dont mean it should be done  
sure  there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there  from the beatles a hard days night to the spice girls spice world  but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter  
everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous  
start off with the story  which  as gruesomely predictable as it is  is the least offensive part of the movie  
the film is inexplicably set in the 80s  a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers  
worse yet  everyones speaking late 90s hiphop slang in what should be 1983  
meant to be partially autobiographical  carey plays billie frank  a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother  
influential club dj julian dice  a  k  a   lucky 7   max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro   hears her sing on a track  and decides to make her a star  
in predictably rapid succession  billie and dice fall for each other  she starts hitting it big  dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass  and suddenly billies on  the roller coaster of superstardom   
in the meantime  billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom  
i wont give away the ending  but  honestly  just think of unicorns and rainbows    
youll figure it out  
the movie screams to be made with camp  and that couldve been fun  
but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better  
what a mistake  
the brief attempts at comic relief  as in a scene where an effeminate russiansounding director gets wacky with filming billies first music video  go over like lead balloons  
instead  the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariahs most dramatic scenes  
which brings us to the performances  of which theres nothing good that can be said  
mariah is primarily seen with a wideeyed deerintheheadlights look frozen on her face  
she actually looks scared during her one love scene  
but you have to wonder if the writing isnt even worse  
so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for careys virginal target audience that its probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb  
even the characters couldnt have been written more absurdly  
theyre all members of a barbie playset  the important film director who swoons   billie  id love to put you in a movie im making   and the bigtime record executive who takes billies demo tape and says   oh  ill make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning   
everyone in the film is a device  and its painful to keep watching just to see another one appear  
to say more would be a waste  
theres so much wrong with this film  
and  it pains me that mariah carey  with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days  as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays  will have to suffer through all the negative reviews shes likely to get  
but  then again  i had to suffer through her movie

1	"the dream team is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane  
billy  played by michael keaton  is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble  
christopher lloyd portrays henry  an obsessivecompulsive who requires that everything be neat  orderly  on schedule  and by the books  
he thinks hes a doctor so he walks around wearing a suit and carrying a clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes and files reports  
jack  played by peter boyle  thinks hes jesus  
and finally  theres stephen furst as albert  a chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases  
the dream team follows the misadventures that beset the foursome when their psychiatrist  dr  weitzman  takes them out of the hospital for a field trip to yankee stadium  
during a pit stop  they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan  
the movies charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast  
the four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively  they never miss an opportunity to argue  bicker  or insult one another  
henry and jack  for example  fight over whos going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game  
the actors in the dream team have a lot of fun with their characters and with each other  
michael keaton is well cast as billy  he gives his cynical character considerable complexity  
as the divinely jack  peter boyle succeeds in keeping his onedimensional character funny and fresh  
although stephen fursts catatonic character is cliched  the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing  
while keaton  boyle  and furst are good  its christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special  
lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance  
his body language  for example  the way he walks  and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character  
lloyds brilliant performance yields a pathetic  moving  and memorable character  
the dream team is a solid comedy with more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise  
the characters are so appealing that you can excuse the film for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot

0	"alexander dumas the three musketeers is one of the most oftenadapted literary works  and for good reason  the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story  
perhaps the musketeer  a new film that  reimagines  the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix  is one adaptation too many  
its just awful  spiritless  silly and unforgivably boring  transforming the timeless classic into a mishmash of oldastime clich  s and incoherent  repetitive action sequences  
this time  dartagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers  who cant even pronounce his characters name  
as a boy  he watched his father get killed by febre  tim roth   a lackey of powerhungry cardinal richelieu  
he vowed to have vengeance  
after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman  he goes looking for his enemy  
on his quest  he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government  
the royal musketeers have lost their gusto  what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinals own guards  
only a few loyal swashbuckers remain  among them athos and portos  who are only figureheads in this movie   
together with dartagnan  they fight to extricate the queen  catherine deneuve  from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant  
oh  and as an afterthought  dartagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn  mena suvari   
just thought id mention that  
now  look  i dont know whose idea this was  but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tonguelashing  
i have nothing against  modernizing  classic works of literature  at the very least  they can inspire viewers to actually read the book  but films as dull as this have no positive side effects  
director peter hyams  known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days  has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas masterwork  the sense of excitement  cause  and camaraderie  
instead  we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous  uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing  
when the musketeers finally get to holler  all for one  and one for all   i could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that i felt  
maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyamss tone  which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the readers digest condensed version of the story that he gives us  
its as though anything that may have been construed as  fun  was purposely expunged from the production  
the joylessness of the proceedings  from the oppressively shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes  can be felt in every frame  
chambers cant act  suvari  roth and deneuve can  but arent given the chance  
and when push comes to shove  the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious  though at least roth gets to play a villain without having to wear an ape suit  
some movies seem sloppy and careless  clearly made for a quick buck  
with the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful  
the film is intricate  stylish and precise  hitting the wrong note every single time

1	"when i first heard about scream in 1996  i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies  
from the master of the horror himself  wes craven  it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them  by making the teenagers do what they know theyre not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them  dont run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door  never say  ill be right back   etc    
when i first heard this description  i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie  
how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies  
was this wes cravens remedy from making  real  bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn  
it just seemed cheap to me  
then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes  involving drew barrymore and a nailbitingly intense phone conversation  completely changed my attitude  
scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick  its also a pretty scary movie  
if youve seen a million of these kinds of films  you know exactly what is going to happen  
this is part of the fun of watching scream  
the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent  attractive teenagers  
to those who rarely see these types of movies  scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film  
theres nothing wrong with that misjudgment though  
i have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience  the newbies to horror and the fanatics  
their opinions on the film were so different but both very positive  
from these varied reviews  i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories  
films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed  in my opinion  if it was not for the outstanding success of scream  
the low  budget 1996 gem may  alongside pulp fiction  be the most influential film of the 1990s  
this influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs  tingle or television programs such as dawsons creek but to others such as myself  we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors  screenwriters  and directors  
scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quicklypaced script by kevin williamson  
within the film are characters who tell other characters  as well as the audience  the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie  
mainly from the rants of randy  jamie kennedy  and stu  matthew lillard   we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well  the virgin always survives  have sex and youre dead meat   
not only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors  
the script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own selfsatisfaction  
in this case  williamson finds these errors for the audiences satisfaction and amusement  
i hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream  which is a spoof of scary movies  
i will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than screams perfect subtlety  
however my last gut feeling about this stuff  scream  was dead wrong    
so who knows

0	"the bachelor is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see  
wading through this gooey  detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic  
those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris odonnell vehicle should wander elsewhere  the bachelor is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy  
awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money  
although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical prettyboy cocoon  chris odonnell has an effortless charm as an actor  
most will recognize him as the highflying robin from the two latest batman films  but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile  
can odonnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders  
perhaps  if he found the proper vehicle    
but the bachelor falls far short of the requirements  
the actor just cant register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success  
a few instances of adorable humor aside  it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is the bachelor  
odonnell plays jimmie  a hopeless romantic in his late twenties whos progressing in a serious relationship with anne  renee zellweger   
jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals  and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage  
the problem is that his proposal sucks  
big time  
you can tell things arent going pleasantly  because jimmie gets the infamous  deerintheheadlights look when anne questions his approach  
and then  the plot  along with the stupidity of the movie  thickens  
jimmies grandfather  peter ustinov  dies suddenly  leaving a video will behind for his grandson  who also happens to be his only living relative   
everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie  
of course  theres a catch  he must get married before his 30th birthday  stay joined with his bride for an entire decade  and produce healthy children within the first five years  
the bad news is that jimmies birthday is the following day  
with anne out of town  he must find a willing bride to share his riches with    
and within a very limited time frame  
there are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of the bachelor  
for one  the movies approach is interesting and not dripping with clich   
another is the colorful cast  
odonnell and zellweger are cute together  and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in its own mediocrity  
ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure  and james cromwell is sincere and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmies marital adventures  
and now the cons  the approach may be interesting  but in trying an oldfashioned method  director gary sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel  
the characters are drawn with obvious  broad strokes  and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable  
yes  the bachelor is far more frustrating than cute  
the screenplay is lamely written  and the subject matter poorly conceived  
the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted  along with whatever promise the film initially contained  
potential goes out the window early to suit sinyors colorful approach  but not a minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the directors wishes  
the bachelor becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it  
youve seen the tv spots  havent you  
odonnell is madly rushing down a deserted street and the caption reads what is this man running from   
in actuality  hes fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune  its one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film   
after seeing the movie  i believe that the approaching horde could be something else  
odonnell could be running from his angry fans  who have just endured the bachelor  and are hunting him down for revenge

critique  incoherent  boring  oneact drivel with no suspense  horribly unbelievable futuristic environment  bad dialogue  careerdefining bad acting by keanu reeves and a hilarious ending  
its too bad because the premise of the film was interesting  but unfortunately for my friends and i  this movie turned out to be just as bad as everyone had warned us  
its one of those films that makes you start laughing halfway through  when you realize that most of the actors in it suck  the location shots are filmed in dark  junkyard  type areas which they would like to have us believe to be futuristic  whatever      and all the sets look like     well  
sets  
there is also absolutely no arc to this story  
it basically starts off with keanu uploading info into his brain  and then a bunch of folks chasing him from place to place until a laughable ending puts a stop to the former uneventful proceedings  
gibson should stick to writing novels and  xfiles  episodes  since his segue into the paranormal tv series was much more entertaining than any of this garbage  
some other hilarities of this film include dolph lundgren as some futuristic jesus character whose supposed to kick ass  henry rollins as a pumpedup cyberdoctor or something  and icet as some kind of a hobo dude with paint all over his face  dont ask   
the ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin and a stupid ghostlady from inside the computer doing some stuff that no one really cares about by that point  
im ashamed to say this film was shot in my hometown of montreal  canada  but sadly enough for us all  it was  
some of the cybertravelling special effects were okay  hence  the 210   but overall  its one of those bad movies thats just funny to watch and cringe at  
thankfully for keanu  he redeemed his scifi career with 1999s the matrix  7  510   
its too bad that he has yet to redeem his lack of acting talent  
little known facts about this film and its stars  as of 1999  director robert longo never directed another fullfeature film  
hmmm    now 
isnt that odd  
   writer william gibson immigrated from the us to canada in 1968  after being rejected for the draft  
he lived in toronto at first  but since 1972  has made vancouver his home  
his 1984 novel  neuromancer  and its sequels 1986s  count zero  and 1988s  mona lisa overdrive  are generally considered to be the definitive works of the  cyberpunk  sciencefiction subgenre  
this film garnered keanu reeves a nomination in the  worst actor  category in the 1996 razzie awards

1	"curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy  but its humour wont appeal to everyone  
to be specific  let me give you an example  
do you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated  
if you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny  dont see curdled  
on the other hand  if you found that sequence to be pretty funny  you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at  
our films heroine  gabriela  played by angela jones  is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers  she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles  
luckily for her  miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage  her scrapbook is getting pretty big  
the killers nickname in the press is the blue blood killer  because he preys on older rich socialite women  and hes played by william baldwin  this is not a spoiler   
one particularly striking m  o  
on the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims  
gabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests  
she immediately quits her job  and signs on with pfcs  which stands for postforensic cleaning service  
no points for guessing what they do  
her workmates are confused by gabrielas fascination with murder  to them  its just a day job  
theres a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk  and what they would say  
gabrielas partner  elena  played by mel gorham  is particularly perturbed by gabrielas wideeyed fascination  and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killers latest scene  theyre the messiest  you see  
unbeknownst to them  the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer  so hes also heading over there   
the comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental  quentin tarantino executiveproduced this film  which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival  
apparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a featurelength film  
there are other parallels  the star of curdled is angela jones  the top billing goes to william baldwin  but really  jones is the central character   whos probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos  the deathobssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction  
that role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film  curdled jr  
jones is great in curdled  shes wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wideeyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her characters innocence or likeability  
she can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow  
its a great performance  
reb braddocks direction is extremely sharp and clever  toeing the line between black humour and bad taste  
the best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing  any more than that would be a spoiler  
the opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing  
of course  its impossible to really take this stuff seriously  but then again youre not really supposed to  braddock knows the audience is in on the joke  and makes it a fun little romp as a result  
the one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film  and it feels like it  the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time  and some parts just seem to drag  
while its running time is already a short 94 minutes  it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing  
curdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax  
itll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well

1	"after a successful run in australia last year  and with much critical praise heaped upon it  muriels wedding opens into medium release this weekend in north america  
muriel heslop is a withdrawn  overweight young woman living in porpoise spit  australia  
she is often the target of her fathers frequent rants at the family  and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music and fantasies of marriage  
her selfloathing is such that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a success  marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired  
after her four cliquey friends dump her  muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls  and muriels wedding unfolds from there  
toni collette plays muriel in a winning performance  conveying both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be accepted  
collette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order to play the chubby title character  
she has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma  easily winning the audience over with an honest  painful performance  
collette basically carries the film  appearing in almost every scene  
muriels father  bill  the battler  heslop  is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politiciandeveloper  
while chumming around with young fans and crowing you cant beat progress  his slogan   bill labels his family as worthless and embarrassments  
rachel griffiths plays rhonda  who becomes muriels cheeky new friend in the film  
she has good chemistry with collette  and the film suffers when griffiths is offscreen  
muriels tormenters  played by pippa grandison  rosalind hammond  belinda jarrett and sophie lee  are twodimensional caricatures  all saucy  vain and bumblingly spiteful  though that is probably due to hogans scripting 
muriels wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm  
hogans use of abba tunes  which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack  is interestingly appropriate  although its repetitiveness tires after awhile  
hogans script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriels earnest quest for acceptance  and the gorgeous scene with muriel windowshopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her  
the glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch  
muriels wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming  if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p  j  hogan  
on my four star scale  i give muriels wedding three stars

1	"the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year  
we are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics  loved by the people  and make tons of money at the box office  
this year  the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic  the mummy  
i have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies  and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them  
that tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza  
in the mummy  the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick oconnell  
he teams up with a curious  clumsy librarian named evelyn  played by rachel weisz  to find the mysterious city of the dead  hamunaptra  
evelyn loves egypt  and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable  
rick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle  and thats why she chose him to lead her there  
also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyns brother  jonathan  played by john hannah  sliding doors   
now in hamunaptra  the three uncover  the book of the dead   
the curious evelyn unlocks the book  reads from it  and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep  arnold vosloo  becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book  
along with imhotep arising from the dead  the ten curses of egypt become in full effect  launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra  
not only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him  he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt  
dont expect huge things out of the mummy  but just expect to have a good time  
this movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects  which may turn off some viewers  
on the other hand  this type of film is one of my favorites  but thats up to you to decide  
there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though  
the state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world  
we are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert  swarms of beetles and locusts  and even creatures crawling under a humans skin  
these may have been in other movies before  but not like in the mummy  
as of now  the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year  but all this could change when star wars episode 1  the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country  
in the past  brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles  
when playing  george  in disneys george of the jungle  he was mainly not known by anyone  
i would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name  and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens  
in the mummy  fraser gets to play an action hero  and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role  as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle  
although brendan fraser is great  rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast  
weisz really reminded me of a character from an old  horror film  
the way she acts  looked  and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time  
evelyn is probably the only character that was likable  considering that the other characters  like john hannahs  didnt get much personal attention  
in many films  when different genres are mixed  the mixing usually works  and i like it for the most part  
in the mummy though  not all of the mixing works  
there are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror  some with potential comedy  some with potential drama  and some with potential pure action  but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work  
the mummy could have gotten an  a  rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these  
i didnt mind the corny oneliners here and there during action sequences  but it certainly could have done without them  
the cinematography is amazing in the mummy  
particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt  we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt  mummies  and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians  
the costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography  
from ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits  the costumes are always top notch  
the bottom line with the mummy  the summer is off to its usually great start

0	"this talky  terriblyplotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux  an exnew orleans cop who gets ensnared in a murder mystery after a lightplane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat  
he and his wife annie  kelly lynch  rescue a little salvadorian girl  samantha lagpacan  from the wreckage and thats when the trouble begins  
the other major players include a local drug lord  eric roberts   his scheming wife  teri hatcher   a soused stripper  mary stuart masterson   and a shady dea agent  vondie curtis hall   
everyone knows everyone else and it makes for a collective thats curious but never compelling  
based on the book by james lee burke  heavens prisoners is so badly plotted that entire  scenes  seem to be missing  
early on  we have no idea of why dave and annie keep the child to themselves  
nor how they eluded both the coast guard and the faa  
later  dave is reunited with a drugabuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and without any explanation  
huh  
the whole movie is like this  perhaps the result of some unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf  
whatever the reason  somebody should tell director phil joanou  final analysis  to recut this mess  
in its present form  heavens prisoners runs only two hours plus change  but it feels like four

0	"i think of i know what you did last summer as the movie that scream and scream 2 could have been  
mind you  though  i mean this in the worst possible way  
i know what you did last summer is a typical slasher flic without the smarts of the screams  
as a result  its even worse than some of your better campy horror pictures  see nightmare on elm street  because it thinks its about thirty times smarter than it is  
based on a teen book of the same name and  disappointingly  adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson  i know what you did last summer begins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined with some startling cinematography of a cliff along the ocean and an angsty sort sitting at the top  
the appropriate mood being set  this is angsthorror for the 90s   we cut over to the july 4th parade in a small north carolina town  
from there  we see the blond  female protagonist  helen shivers  woodenly played by sarah michelle geller   getting crowned croaker queen as the blond male  hero   barry cox  woodenly played by ryan phillipe   and matched brunette pair of protagonists  julie james and ray bronson  woodenly played by party of fives jennifer love hewitt and freddie prinze jr   respectively  cheer her on  
after getting drunk at a party  going to a beach to wittily discuss urban legend and indulge in some foreshadowing  and having some meaningful sex  if you believe what the characters say   the four run down some guy crossing the windy cliff road at night  
his face is mangled so they cant tell who it is  and they come to the decision to dump him in the ocean so as to not ruin any of their future chances for success in the world  
cut to one year later  
the lives of our protagonists have gone from annoying to bad  
main brunette female  the bright one of the bunch  has been plagued with guilt and almost failed out of college  
blond female has forfeited her dreams of starring on guiding light  and now works at the family store in town  
brunette male is a fisherman  living off the land  
blond male has become a complete jerk and quarterback on some college football team  
then  predictably  their past comes back to haunt them  
it all begins with an irrational murder  followed by some taunting of protagonists by the mysterious killer  bad acting by a good actress  anne heche   an improbable plot  bad acting by the main bad actors  some more killing  concluding in a climactic scene  mostly climactic in the relief at the end of the movie  
all the while  the actors and actresses spout off bad lines  and main brunette male does his best keanu reeves imitation  
not that the movie was without pleasure  
count the illogical plot twists and bad lines for some fun  
mostly  though  note the costumes of main females and how trendily unattractive they make the otherwise eyecatching pair look

0	"  i would appreciate it if you didnt do that again   
starring jet li  bridget fonda  tch  ky karyo  burt kwouk  
directed by chris nahon  
rated r  
its no secret that martial arts film often use their plot simply to get from one action sequence to another  
when the fight scenes are enough to justify paying admission  there is no problem with this  as in most jackie chan projects and a lot of the hong kong actioners  
when they arent  well  were in bad shape  
kiss of the dragon  jet lis second consecutive american misfire  plays like one big miscalculation  and fails even as the most rudimentary entertainment  
now before i start getting emails angrily touting the genius of jet li  let me explain myself  
li is as spectacular as ever here  and i dont think anyone would ever dare call his martialartsstar skills into question  
the problem isnt with him  its with the movies tone  
the much touted fightscenes here are filmed with such unflinching  unrelenting brutality that they are unpleasant to watch  
theyre joyless  perfuctory  lis rogue chinese detective is more of a killing machine than a hero  a terminator with a black belt instead of a metal skeleton  
but even the terminator in judgement day had a sympathetic side  
the plot isnt relevant  but if youre curious  its some nonsense about a chinese law enforcement officer  li  sent to paris to investigate a possible drug ring and encounter a corrupt chief of police  tcheky karyo   who kills people and does sinister things with no motivation whatsoever  
oh yeah  and lis character is also an acupuncture expert who is able to ease pain andor kill at the touch of a needle  
  kiss of the dragon  is the name of an acupuncture maneuver  in which you stick a needle in a precise location on the back of the victims neck  somehow redirecting all of the bodys bloodflow to the brain and killing the poor sap more or less immediately  
theres a vague attempt to humanize li by having him fall in love with a downtrodden prostitute  whose daughter is being held hostage  for some reason  by the villain  
this is one of the worst love stories i have ever seen on screen  even worse than the one in pearl harbor  
theres no conviction whatsoever as the movie barely pays lip service to it  its only here because someone apparently thought there should be some kind of boymeetsgirl subplot  
kiss of the dragon was written by luc besson  whose screenplay the messenger  the story of joan of arc  for all of that films flaws  was at least thoughtful  
i dont know why the guy got himself involved in this train wreck  but perhaps he wanted to so something more mainstream after the neverending weirdness of the fifth element and the aforementioned stylized biopic  
i suppose you could call this mainstream  but ill choose the bizarre any time of the day  
if action scenes in a movie are going to be brutal instead of dazzling  you need a story to justify watching them  
the filmmakers behind kiss of the dragon should have rethought their strategy  
no one will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling  but i hear rush hour 2 is coming in just a few weeks

1	"in my review of theres something about mary  i said something to the effect of  laughter isnt everything   
i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate  laughter isnt everything  unless im watching a jim abrahams film  
see  spoofs are easy with me  
i love movies  and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love  
sometimes im the only one in the theater laughing  
sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so highpitched in comparison to my speaking voice  it cuts right through everyone elses laughter   
sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film  
abrahams latest film  mafia   induced this kind of hysteria upon me  
its gotten some mediocre reviews  but  hey  im the guy who laughs at everything  
there may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film  but there are far more that work  and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness  
i enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thoughtprovoking  
most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things  like develop characters  shape stories  and other such nonsense  
mafia  
has no pretentions about characters or story  and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh  
the film begins on the perfect high note  with a mockery of the opening of casino  
our hero  jay mohr  is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car  which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire  
to describe the story of mafia  
is absurd and pointless  but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films  with a lot of casino references inserted throughout  
along the way  the parodies seem arbitrary  and rarely victimize mob films  pictures like the english patient  forrest gump  and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing  
movies like this rely on just a few things  but the most important element is direction  
abrahams has been down this path many times before  hot shots   top secret   airplane   and any other film with an exclamation point in the title   and so i hold most of the success of mafia  
to his experience  
he takes just the right attitude in each scene  and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references  one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic  but it never develops   
the actors are all energetic  which helps a lot with the tone of the film  
mohr  suicide kings  paulie   who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors  is so good here  
he looks like hes having so much fun that hes containing his laughter in every scene  watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool   
hes probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material  
lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brandos godfather  while pamela gidley is deadon in a fullblown mockery of sharon stone  
the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that im supposed to give examples of things and be specific  
unfortunately  i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia  
that i cant remember a lot of what made me laugh  
but thats a good sign  mafia  
is so funny that i wasnt even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory  
i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain  
i know that doesnt sound particularly complimentary  but when watching a dumb comedy like this  the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain  
finally  a film that does this for me  
"
1	"this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueffs play  hospitality suite  its 
about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention  whose chicago company has sent them to wichita  where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the 16th floor of the hotel  where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna  someone named dick fuller  who is the head of a big industrial corporation  
he is someone they have never met before  but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account  it is their only reason for coming to the convention  
  the big kahuna  revels in salesmentalk among the three white christian males  two of them  larry  spacey  and phil  devito   who are veteran salesmen  having teamed together for the last twelve years  while bob  facinelli  is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department  
these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna  as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite  
the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job  and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life  
the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why  
what comes into question is their opinions on life and death  on god and morality  and on how they make a living  
these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch  
their dialogue is acerbic  witty  and analytical  
following in the long tradition of salesmen films  from death of a salesman  the tin men  and glengarry glen ross  as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high  
in this case  it is landing the big kahuna  
they each are trying to see why hes on top and why they are chasing after him  
what makes this film different than the others  is its blatant religious message  comparing orthodox religion to what they do  as both must sell their product  
and how after each ones psyche is stripped clean by the other  there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each  
the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna  but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen  
larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life  
bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ  
his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in  
bob is a baptist  who takes a very nonquestioning and literal attitude about religion  
to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin  according to the way he reads the bible  
when asked by larry why he married his wife  he seems puzzled and cant even say because he loves her  only that marriage is something sacred to him  
the contrast in their personalities is stark  
larry is all business  he simply wants to close the sale  
he comes into the room pumped for the convention  using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman  
he criticizes phil for being so placid  for getting such a small suite  for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp  and for being burnedout  
he tells him to go on a vacation  
get a woman  
while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change  now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife  after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long  
he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in  
he has always been a charmer  shaking everyones hand  trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale  
larry is more aggressive as a salesman  he is always a heart attack away from every big sale  
in contrast  bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him  
this is his first time for him on the road  
when dick fuller doesnt arrive at the party the salesmen throw  larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering  
when told that he spoke to the secretary  larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account  
but when they start talking to bob  whom they forced to act as the bartender  they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another mans name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus  
bob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards  and that he invited bob to attend  
larry and phil cant fathom how bob didnt make a sales pitch  
but they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fullers attention about their companys product as they sent him off to meet fuller  and will await his return in the hotel room  
these two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass  
the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room  as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives  
these three performers were outstanding  each understanding what their role called for  each coming through with a marvelous performance  
the only problem with the film  is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience  
but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics  give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see

0	"the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride  and its sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics  both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the years finest films  
so  naturally  when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found  this notion left me puzzled  
it is a rare thing for a childrens movie to be praised this highly  so wouldnt you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly  magical  piece of work  
a tad bewildered  but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films  i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind  having great expectations for the film  
looking back  i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater  
believe me  i wanted to like babe  pig in the city  
the plot seemed interesting enough  after the events that took place in the original  babe the sheeppig has become a legitimate national phenomenon  
but after a fateful encounter with a water well  arthur hogget  james cromwell  who the movie could have used alot more of  has been rendered bedridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially  
the only solution that his wife  magda szubanski  going from delightfully charming to downright annoying  can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair  i think  and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank  set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public   
problem is  the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded  city   a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion  
setting the main plot in motion  mrs  hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals  despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels  
it is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters  the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright  
here is where the film took a wrong turn  
up until this point  i had being having a rather enjoyable experience  
the beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs  hogget is accused of smuggling drugs  
unfortunately  the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel  none of them being even onetenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe  
the main topic of discussion surrounding babe  pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children  and i believe it is  
at one point  a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown  
at other times  we are treated to surrealistic flashbacks to mrs  hoggets full cavity search at the airport  
in fact  the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing  
however  that is  as they say  neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway  
the animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half  let alone entertain a child  
another problem i found with the film was its sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story  
if youre going to make a darker and more sinister sequel  fine  
it may not be my cup of tea  but at least it is a noble ambition  
but to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs  hogget swinging from walltowall of a ballroom in elastic overalls  
it just didnt feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining  and the same goes for the rest of the movie  
"
1	"well  i know that stallone is 50 years old now  but in daylight he doesnt look it  
daylight is a great disaster movie  
if youve seen cliffhanger  youll know stallones character already  
a guy with a bad past  but is in the right place at the wrong time  
a tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying  very  flammable toxic waste  
a dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball  and what a fire ball it was   
stallone  a former emergency medical service man  is chauffeuring a rich couple around  when they reach the outside of the tunnel  before the explosion  
then  30 minutes into the movie  boom  
from here on  the plot takes a back seat  and we are treated to some of the best camera work and action staged  
most all the action is plausible and will hold you at the edge of your seat  
there are a few melodramatic parts here  but  they tend to work out well  
there is no general antagonist in this film  but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that  
daylight is a great film  i saw a nonmatinee showing of it  and i thought it was worth every penny  
the characterizations are mostly flat  one dimesional  but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters  
rob cohen  dragonheart  does a great job with this film

0	"in french  the phrase  film noir  literally means  black film   
webster defines it as  a type of crime film featuring cynical malevolent characters in a sleazy setting and an ominous atmosphere that is conveyed by shadowy photography and foreboding background music   
classic film noir  including such memorable fare as  the big sleep   the original  cape fear   and orson welles striking  a touch of evil   employed black and white photography to emphasize the long shadows associated with the genre  
color came into play with neonoir films like  chinatown  and  blade runner   
  l  a  confidential   easily the best film of 1997  is a wonderful piece of contemporary neonoir filmmaking  
for a textbook example of how to take all the elements of neonoir and create an absolute mess  theres  palmetto   
based on  just another sucker   a short story written by british author rene raymond under the pseudonym james hadley chase   palmetto  shows what happens when a filmmaker puts style ahead of substance  
director volker schlondorff   tin drum   the handmaids tale   stated  we werent even sure for a long time if it was going to be a thriller or a comedy   
it shows  
  palmetto  is too preposterous too be taken seriously as a thriller and too ponderous to work as a comedy  
the story begins when journalist harry barber  woody harrelson  is released from prison  
someone turned states witness and revealed that harry was framed  a  reward  for blowing the lid on corruption in the small florida town of palmetto  
bitter and broke  harry plans to hitchhike to miami and start his life over  but exgirlfriend nina  gina gershon  appears to return him to palmetto  
while hanging out at a bar  he notices that a beautiful woman has left her purse in a phone booth  
harry pockets her cash  only to have the woman reappear and catch him with her money in his pocket  
no problem  though  
the radiant blonde is rhea malroux  elisabeth shue   the young wife of a very rich older man with heart problems  and she has a proposition for harry  
rhea needs  a threatening voice and someone to collect the ransom  for the staged kidnapping of her teenage stepdaughter odette  chloe sevigny   
the girls want to bilk a halfmillion dollar  ransom  from the old man and will happily give harry 50  000 for helping with the scam  
things go wrong  of course  
odette is found dead  leaving harry frantically trying to dispose of the corpse and cover his tracks  
in an ironic twist  harry is asked to work for the local d  a  s 
office  
they need a press liaison to field questions about odettes kidnapping and feel that harry is the perfect man for the job  
not a bad setup for a noir film  if only schlondorff knew how to handle the material  but he never settles on a consistent tone  
the actors dont know what to do with their characters either  muddling the proceedings even further  
as if that wasnt enough  the story suffers from major problems in logic  
woody harrelson is a talented actor with an admirable willingness to take on risky parts  but hes lost here  
presented as a crusading journalist who was horribly wronged  it makes no sense that harry would be stupid and dishonest enough to get caught up in this scheme  
harrelson clearly doesnt know what to do with harrys character  so he spends most of the film glowering  sweating and generally acting miserable  
meanwhile  elisabeth shue gives a goofy performance  behaving like a vamp on nitrous oxide  
as the stepdaughter  chloe sevigny lays on so many slurpy quirks that she comes off like juliette lewis jr  despite a number of steamy scenes  theres no chemistry between harrelson and the women  
to make matters worse  schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the characters lips are running over each others bodies  
two particularly bad scenes highlight the films problems  
while driving with a body in his trunk  harry has a minor car wreck and a cop shows up  
the officer wants to help change harrys flat tire and asks him to open the trunk  
harrys pathetic attempts to keep the trunk closed might have worked if played as comedy  but under schlondorffs grim direction  the scene is just embarrassing  
the films nadir comes when a bad guy prepares to kill harry and nina  
were supposed to be horrified watching our hero dangling over a bathtub filled with acid  but by this point the film has foundered so badly that the scene is merely reminiscent of when jessica and roger rabbit were suspended over a vat of dip  
had  palmetto  been played with tongue firmly in cheek  it might have been an entertaining shaggy dog story  
but under the harsh direction of schlondorff  the film is just a sluggish paintbynumbers exercise in neo noir cluelessness  
avoid this nonsense and go see  l  a  confidential  instead

0	"in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the reallife incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa  
the twilight murders  another one from the series  is dealing with the case of gordon kahl  played by rod steiger   old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u  s  government  
after being released  he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest  
when the u  s  marshals come to arrest him  it turns out that kahl isnt alone  
many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist antigovernment beliefs  and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that  
that brings fbi on the scene  and agent mayberly  michael gross  is supervising the manhunt  
however  his efforts seem fruitless  since kahl still has many supporters  some of them even in the local law enforcement  
after betrayed  1988 thriller by costa gavras  hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising rightwing extremism in the american northwest  and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing  when media hype brought rightwingers back into spotlight  
until that time  only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon  
unfortunately  the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film  that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script  
sometimes  like many american tv movies  it creates drama where drama shouldnt be  
on the other hand  film is steadily directed by dick lowry  and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl  
on the other hand  michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible  
however  film does deal with potentially thoughtprovoking social and political issues  so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldnt be the total waste of time

1	"making his directorial debut  actor jon favreau brings along his swingers costar  vince vaughn  for this tale of two mugs on a career trajectory to nowheresville  
favreau  who also wrote the script  is bobby  vaughn is ricky  
by day they are construction workers  
they also are wannabe contenders  but neither has had much success  
their last bout pitted them against each other and was a draw  leaving bobbys record at 551  
these two l  a  notsowise guys also work for max  peter falk   a midlevel mobster  who is patient and understanding with bobby  but who hates rickys guts  
max has an easy job for bobby  fly to new york and make a simple delivery to a gangster named ruiz  a smooth and silky sean combs   
bobby  because of his lifelong friendship with ricky  pleads with max to give his pal another chance and let him tag along to the big apple  
against his better judgment  max agrees  
of course ricky  a motormouth who inserts both feet everytime he speaks  nearly screws up everything  
while bobby tries to stay calm and professional  ricky begins swaggering and throwing money around as if he was john gotti or tony soprano  
the constrast in styles and the chemistry between favreau and vaughn is what makes made so enjoyable to watch  
favreau with his hounddog face and slowburn personality could be a modernday oliver hardy  only much wiser  
vaughn is like someone vaccinated with a phonograph needle  he just keeps yakking and yakking  unaware of the havoc he creates  
yet despite bobbys constant aggravation and agitation with his partner  a bond of affection and loyalty binds them  
the contrast between the two friends is interesting to watch  
bobby is buttondowned  tightlywound  always waiting for the next shoe courtesy of ricky  to drop  
ricky is mostly oblivious to the problems he creates and is genuinely surprised when he comes under attack for his faux paus  
in new york  the two lackeys are like fish out of water  stumbling from one situation to another  trying to keep alive  
combs is elegant  cool and lowkey menacing as the gangsta they are sent to meet  
falk is amusing in his small role  while famke janssen nearly breaks your heart as bobbys lowlife girlfriend  
more than anything  made is a movie with heart  
it is loud  obnoxious and very talkative  
but the cameraderie between bobby and ricky holds the key to its interest  
favreau does a commendable job in his directorial debut  
he is a player to be watched as he can only improve with experience

0	"this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be  one of the hottest writers in hollywood   
he wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream  810   then added the successful i know what you did last summer  7  510  
script to his mix  and also created the popular tv series  dawsons creek   
so when he asked to direct his first movie  based on his first ever script written  everyone and their grandma said  sure  go for it    
uhhm  my question is    did anyone bother reading this stupid script    
plot  ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west  mrs  tingle  and set to lose her scholarship to college  
when she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story  they end up tying her up  and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman  
critique  its not so much that this is a bad movie  than the fact that it sucks  
this movie is chockfull of onedimensional characters  contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on  zero tension or thrills  plot holes the size of my big ass  lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie  and molly ringwald  vivica a  fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles  
i was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery  810  and 9 to 5  but unfortunately for williamson  he went nowhere with the bright foundation  making references to the exorcist and dr  
zhivago  which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate  
he also forgot about suspense  with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions  unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue  
sure  katie holmes is cute  and her costar  marisa coughlan  did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist  worth two points out of my three on ten   but how can we forgive the biggest onedimensional character in any film  holmes rival in the film  mrs  tingles complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her  are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays   and a transparent romance between holmes and some longhaired dude  hired to be the poor mans version of skeet ulrich  who himself is a poor mans version of johnny depp    
all in all  this movie was laughable for me  provided me with no insight into anything  demonstrated williamsons genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script  and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into  unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability  humanity or capacity to comprehend  
no hip lines  no cheap thrills  just a dull time at the movie theater  
if you want to see a funny teenage movie  go see detroit rock city  810   and thank my drunken  sorry ass in the morning  
little known facts about this film and its stars  kevin williamsons father was a fisherman  
kevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer  7  510   
he is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally  so is dawson leery on tvs  dawsons creek   a show kevin created  
he was once an aspiring actor  
in fact  he even landed a bit part on tvs  another world   
also  williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs  tingle  which is also loosely based on the book  killing mr  griffin  by the writer of i know what you did last summer  7  510   
lois duncan  
he has also come out and said that he is a gay man  
helen mirren was born in london  england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff  
she is married to director taylor hackford  whose works include devils advocate  810  and an officer and a gentleman  8  510   
this film was originally titled killing mrs  
tingle  but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident  
actress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called  wasteland   
this is actor barry watson first full feature film  
he has played the character of  seth  on tvs  malibu shores  several times

0	"  with all that education  you should know what happiness is   
starring sylvia chang  teresa hu  hsu ming  li lieh  mao hsuehwei  directed by edward yang  written by yang and wu nienchen  cinematography by christopher doyle and chang huikung 
every country has  eventually  its new wave  
france had its nouvelle vague  brazil its cinema novo  china its fifth generation  and on and on  
some waves just take longer than others  before they wash over us  cleansing us with the balm of discovery  
taiwans new wave came in the 1980s  in the work of directors like hou hsiaohsien  wan jen  and edward yang  that day  on the beachyangs first featureis central  
it created a new language for young taiwanese directors  even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering  
later works refined the techniques that yang first explored here  giving taiwan a distinctive international presence  
that day itself is long and frustrating  the document of a nations attempt to find a voice  
it does not lack ambition  
it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan  in the manner of antonioni  elaborating the alienation that the westernized whitecollar middleclass feel as their lives are shaped by oldfashioned rolesdedicated career men  loyal housewivesthat they find unfulfilling  
jiali  sylvia chang  is the focus  but the film brings others into its compassher husband  her brother  friends from her college daysas it charts her discontents  
no one is happy  
jiali married her husband  welei  at a young age  
at the time  her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage  despite his affection for another woman  and so jialis marriage seemed  in comparison  a good one  she chose welei of her own free will  they loved each other  
but it goes wrong  
that day dutifully presents all the clich  s  welei becomes absorbed in his career  indulges in an affair with a coworker  jiali feels restless and trapped  bound by a choice she made while young  but which no longer seems wise  
the film never redeems these clich  s by conveying the feel of authentic experience  the intensity of lived pain  and much of it seems trite and belaboured  
it unfolds  awkwardly  as a series of flashbacks  told during a luncheon in vienna  where jiali meets her brothers old flame  teresa hu   now a concert pianist  whom she has not seen since college  
both women seem rather sad  and resigned to their sadness  
their circumstances  and those of jialis brother and a college friend  suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choicesmarried the wrong man  chosen the wrong career path  etc  but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate  
it is not that jiali married the wrong man  she didnt  
the problem is that she needed to marry at alland that if she did not marry  she would still be just as unhappy  
for a woman in modern taiwan  that day tells us  the cards are stacked  the dice are loaded  she can play the game  but the house always wins  
the films sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan  
seen now  it does not seem provocative  
indeed  its hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy  it may be ambitious  it may be innovative  but it is also terribly  terribly dull  
and what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us  yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others  and his use of those methods is fumbling  uncertain  undisciplined  
nor does he bring anything newother than the localeto the material  
there are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives forin a young couples first kiss  in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husbands mistressbut they are brief  
too often  yang devotes needless time to mundane scenesgrocery shopping  flowerarrangingin which nothing happens  little is said  no emotion imparted  
perhaps  if the film were content to focus on such reflective  inward moments  leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings  it might have been ambiguous  suggestive  insinuating  
but jiali and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence  they talk about their problems  at length  in detail  redundantly  and eliminate all subtleties  
at two hours and fortyfive minutes  it all seems exorbitantly long  indulgently longwinded  
consider the defining moment for jiali  the titular day on the beach  
the thrust of the whole film explains  easily enough  what we are to think of that moment  what it means when she walks away from a particular situation  
even so  the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally  in case we may have missed the point  
needless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed  and that is the problem throughout  
the look of the film is as tedious as the drawnout narrative  
it was the first feature shot by christopher doyleat least  its his name in the creditswho is now rightly regarded as one of the worlds leading cinematographers  
in the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong karwai  he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image  
you would never know it from watching that day  which  due either to doyles inexperience or yangs humdrum direction  is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible  
in scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage  that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience  but none of the damage  none of the heartbreak

1	"catherine deane  jennifer lopez  is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up  
she has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma  but the boys parents arent happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life  
as if trying to assure the boys parents wasnt hard enough on her  a new development arises that furthers the strain on deanes mental faculties  
a vicious serial killer named carl stargher  vincent donofrio  has been kidnapping women  locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days  then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into lifesized dolls  
just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell  stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia  
the police  led by fbi agent peter novak  vince vaughn  are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victims body  but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state  
in a last ditch attempt  they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering starghers mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell    
a cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours  
initial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix  
while it does share some characteristics with both films  particularly the first forty minutes  which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs   the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm  
the buzz around this project is that firsttime feature film director tarsem singh  who won many awards for his video of r  e  m  s  losing my religion   wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story  and a good portion of this film supports that theory  
despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments  the cell does feature some remarkable imagery  
all of the sequences where we delve into someones mind are incredibly beautiful  including the dank mind of stargher  whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h  r  giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video   proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe  
the first sequence that takes place in starghers mind is by far the best  featuring one of the most ingenious traps ive ever seen in a film  involving a horse  which no one seeing this film will probably forget   a zoolike display of starghers victims which are animated like marionettes  and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room  
if the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant  but alas  the sequences only become more silly as they go along  despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film   
the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images  but at least vincent donofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance  magnified by ten  thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed   
in my opinion  donofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film  but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful  i  e   
the newton boys  feeling minnesota  the thirteenth floor  and the velocity of gary  that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him  
the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though  and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him  
detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film  as it contains heavy doses of both  
besides the nipple ring removal i mention above  there is also starghers penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs  prior to his catatonia and capture  which will have audiences recoiling  
a sequence where catherine enters starghers mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting  
one moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spitlike device  
as a narrative film  the cell is sorely lacking  
as a collection of images though  the cell is extremely well done  
although the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half  singh has done what he supposedly set out to do  make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together  
unfortunately  a wellwritten script should have been considered too  because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv  provided  of course  that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos

0	"arye cross and courteney cox star as a pair of bostonians who meet in a bar  go to the movies  fall in love  move in together  etc  
review  
well  if you havent seen when harry met sally or he said  she said  or if you dont watch love  war on television  you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages  
however  if youve seen any of these  than you have seen most of this film  
this of course doesnt mean its bad  
some of it is amusing  but overall  i just had to ask whats the point  
arye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love  
kevin pollack is the stereotypical femalefearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes  most if which werent very funny  
couteney cox is the stereotypical careerminded woman who falls in love  
julie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman  
  notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical  
this film uses a lot of formula  the plot is basically known from the opening credits   
so what is good about the movie  
well as i said there are a few amusing moments  
surprisingly  julie brown  who i usually find just plain goofy  was the best thing in the film  
also there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual  
gee  this is really short  
not much to say about the film really  
it is just kind of there  
watching it on video might not be a complete waste of time  but i wouldnt recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre

0	"this film is worth seeing for those who want to see what mick jagger looks like when sporting an abe lincoln beard  
the rock and roller is asked to carry the film as the action antihero of australian legend    ned 
kelly  the socalled robin hood of the aussies  
but he fails to be convincing  in my opinion he is better suited to play gene kelly than ned kelly  
the film opens to a bw prologue of ned kelly bravely going to his execution  
then it goes to technicolor and ned is seen in what goes for flashback  coming home from jail after a 3year sentence to see his mom and reacquaint himself with the large kelly family  
this scene is set in 1871  
in the background we hear the booming voice of waylon jennings  as he sings shel silversteins lyrics  which tells  of neds hatred for the british rule and hope for ireland to be a republic  
ned says a debt must be paid    
as he hears voices from his dead father  his classdivided country  and his conscience  all telling him to get revenge  
so begins neds romp through australias outback  seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have suffered  
he begins by stealing horses  after complaining about the unfair tax law on horses that stray  which favors the rich landowners  
when hes only 20 he forms a gang  causing him to hide the rest of his life from the police  who put a price on his head of two thousand pounds  
when neds mother  clarissa kaye  is jailed on a false charge of abetting criminals and sentenced to 35 years  ned offers to surrender in exchange for his mothers freedom  
when the authorities refuse  the kelly brothers go on a robbing rampage  burning mortgages of the poor found in postal vaults and murdering some soldiers  
rampaging through the outback  they gather sympathy among the poor and lower classes  who dont trust the traps  police   
spoiler to follow in the next paragraph  
in the climax  kelly and his gang plan to ambush a train with british police  but someone kelly trusted tips the police on the train and kelly is trapped in a saloon and captured  
neds brothers commit suicide rather than be taken alive  
but kellys gang escapes  as ned heroically has the police go after only him and his brothers  as they become decoys  
this was a flat presentation  hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kellys call for justice  
jagger didnt have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson  
the story failed to focus on australia  seemingly a more british film than australian  
under richardsons lackluster direction  all jagger seemed to do  was proclaim his innocence and vow revenge  which soon became a shrill cry  
if you want to see a better film about ned kelly  catch  mad dog morgan   76   a much truer and more daring version  with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kellys madness  something this film could only do in a hohum manner

1	"almost a full decade before steven spielbergs saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both  anti war  and  prosoldier   john irvins hamburger hill proved it could  
lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stones platoon  this excellent film was dismissed as  too militaristic   
its hard to understand exactly whyunless irvin  in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable  and often naive  reasons  chose to show up  for the vietnam debacle  has refused to present us with the stone killer  drugstoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what  the polack  the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn  became to wwii movies  
hamburger hill  based on a true story  is not an easy film to watch  
there is a scene that will have graying antiwar activists squirming in their seats  or moved to genuine tears  
and the climactic final assault on the  hill  in question is visually confusing  
gristly realities are presented in brief flashes  as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered  
and in the mud and smoke officer and enlistee  veteran and  newbie   black soldier and white  become almost indistinguishable from each other  as they do in the chaos of actual combat  
the acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney b  vance as docin a role that will have many flatly disbelieving that this is same actor they cheered as  seaman jones  in mctiernans red october  
if youve seen private ryan  you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hillif only to determine that the all the valour and horror of spielbergs vision was as present in the ashau valley as it was at omaha beach

1	"james l  brooks  one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news  returns to the big screen with this entertaining  if slightly flawed comedy  
nicholson plays melvin udall  probably the most horrible person ever on the screen  
hes racist  homophobic  and never has a good word to say to anyone  
so  nobody talks to him  except waitress carol conelly  t  v 
sitcom star hunt  who was last seen in twister  1996   
naturally  udall  conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop  kinnear  who nicholson hates  all hit it off in the end  
like good will hunting  1997  and titanic  1997   even though the outcome is completely obvious  as good as it gets is an enjoyable  funny and warm comedy  
nicholson is hilarious as melvin  churning out insults with superb relish  
only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers  
hunt is also good as waitress carol  and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson  
theres also  thankfully  a bit of chemistry between them  
kinnear  as the gay neighbor  seems to have a slightly underwritten role  hes more of a plot convience than a character  
although his performance is good  his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together  
in fact  the scene stealer is simons dog  who is funnier than nicholson  
but then again  pets are always cute on screen  
providing solid support is cuba gooding  jnr  jerry maguire  1996  and yeardly smith  who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons  although gooding isnt as good as is character in maguire  he is still fun  
he overacts a little  but not so much as to be annoying  
smith is also good  although she has a fairly small role  
even director lawrence kasdan  body heat  1981  makes an appearance as a doctor  
but this is primarily nicholsons film  and every scene hes in  hes steals it  
hes character is so hateful  though  its amazing that anyone talks to him at all  especially carol  
and this is the films main problem  
its totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin  
she doesnt fall in love with him naturally  the film forces her to fall in love with him  
also  melvins character seems to go too nice  too quickly  
i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice  loving person  
it would take a helluva long time  much longer than this film would like to make out  
brooks direction is good  though  if a bit average  but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience  
he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones  he tends to pile on to much schmaltz  but generally hes good  
theres also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer  
but  generally  as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do  which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie  
the movie is a bit overlong  but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly  
overall  as good as it gets is a fun movie  even though it may be unbelivable  and certainly worth seeing  if just for jack nicholsons performance   
not quite as good as it gets  pardon the bad joke   but still good fun

0	"summer movies are  by nature  dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money  
wild wild west  the latest will smith affair  follows much the same formula  except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies  
will smith plays jim west  a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses  
he is called by president grant  kline  to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing  
west is paired up with scientist artemus gordon  kline again  and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind  named dr  loveless  branagh  with a zany moustache   
before i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair  ill give it a chance with the positives  
theres a nice credit sequence  the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye  and the special effects are decent enough  
theres also a pleasant soundtrack  
buried deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes  
and salma hayek pops up as the female interest  which is always nice to see  
apart from these factors  though  nothing else in wild wild west works  
firstly  theres little chemistry between smith and kline  who appears to be in it purely for the money  
one would expect zingers passing between the two  none arise  
both of them plod through the below standard plot  knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end  
not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment  although he is over the top  the material doesnt present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy  
therefore  he just comes across as loud as obnoxious  
the only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek  who is given so little screen time its embarrassing  
she appears to be in the film to merely show off her body  and be ogled at by kline and smith  
her character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script  and there is no sense of realism about the character  
the humour in the film is also very off  
will smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black  here  not even smith could save the humour on display  
the script largely boils down to insults that arent very funny  and oneliners that barely raise a smirk  
its also somewhat racist  although it doesnt intend to be  with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching  and actually says slavery is good to save himself  
its not a funny scene  and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably  
the film also makes the tragic mistake that a man  in this case kline  in a dress is automatically unfunny  it isnt  but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness  
theres also problems with the plot  
jim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations  but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying  and rely purely on luck  rather than audience pleasing skill  
plot elements are introduced into the film  and then thrown away just as quickly  
the main piece of the story  a 80 foot mechanical  steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive  but theres no particular reason why it should be built  
why not loveless build a great big tank  instead of an ungainly  fragile piece of machinery thats just begging to be blown up  
director barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them  with some nice camera tricks  but even this is missing from this stilted affair  
wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing  but not much of it is evident  making this film drag out even more  
its a sad thing when four  credited  screenwriters  a talented director and a willing star cant make a film work  and eventually wild wild west collapses under its sexist  mildly racist  unfunny weight

  south park  bigger  longer and uncut  is undoubtedly crude  offensive  meanspirited movie  that comes off as a politcally correct movie too  
if your canadian  a strong christian  fat  gay or anything else  you will be offended  
but when you watch this movie  there is no doubt that you will laugh  
based on the wildly popular comedy central tv show  south park stars cartman  an overweight  foulmouthed kid  with attitude  and a sweet side  
kenny  a poor kid who gets killed in every episode  and talks with his coat hood covering his head  
stan a regular  sometimes boring kid who has problems with women  
and kyle a lonely jew who talks to his poop  
the movie opens with a funny  but messageable song  that all of the people of south park sing  
cartman  stan  kenny and kyle are very excited to see the new terrance and phillip  beavis and butthead types  movie  asses of fire   
but when the kids get up to the movie to get the tickets  they learn the movie is rated r  which of course means that anyone under the age of 17 cannot get in without a parent or legal guardian  
the kids do not understand this  and they pay a homeless man to buy their tickets  
while in the movie  laughing at the movie  terrance and phillip cuss repeatedly entertaining the kids  
they kids then go out and cuss themselves  getting in trouble and causing kyles mom to go against the mpaa  
while doing this kenny learns a thing or to  by proving to cartman he can light his fart on fire  
kenny does so  dies  and goes to hell  to find out that satan and saddam huiessan  homosexual lovers   are about to take over the world  if terrance and phillip die  
from here on  nothing more should be said to keep the rest a surprise  
but believe me  this isnt your regular south park tv show  and should not be seen by anyone under 14 or more  
this film contains extreme profanity  over 130  f  words and a collection of others   
but beyond being bad in a tasteless type way  south park  bigger  longer and uncut has many messages that are embedded inside it  
but i bet you will not leave the movie  for at least laughing one time or more  
and enjoying yourself  
take it from me  south park  b  l  and u  isnt as good as youd hope  but it is good for some laughs

0	"remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage  
  pulp fiction  and  fargo  both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture  and not surprisingly  a slew of ripoffs followed in the years thereafter  
that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing  the way of the gun  that at first glance looks like another of those wannabes but upon closer inspection doesnt look like anything comprehendable  
its a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere  a film that wont allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous  
complexity should come as no surprise to anyone whos familiar with mcquarrie  he wrote  the usual suspects   which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim  
that film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate  confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings  
you have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that  if its really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating   
with  the way of the gun  mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea  but this time the story is far less commercial  a shame because maybe that would have helped  
the film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but arent hellbent on death either  played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro   
they get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a bigshot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization  
they figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother  played by juliette lewis  and get a nice ransom  
along the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec  his wife  their hired goons and the  bag man   played by james caan  the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what hes doing   
the exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously cant call the authorities for help  
his goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers trail and each make different offers to get the mother back  
the execs son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right  
meanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the doublecrosses  secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all  
mcquarrie doesnt know the meaning of the word simple  
he seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie  
everything has to be complicated and confusing  so much so that its to the point of surrealism  
nothing is what it seems in this reality  its one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industrys rules and regulations  
every scene with caans character exemplifies this perfectly  the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him  getting into conversations about  the business  and how it works and were hardly given a clue as to what theyre talking about  
these characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but theyre more like ideas rippedoff from sketches found in david mamets trash  
no one here really acts like a real person  and the story is even further removed from reality  
its like a dream without any appeal  
take the opening scene for example  the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff  
they sit on a brandnew mercedes and the car alarm goes off  the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they dont move  
the guy and his loudmouth  pottymouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them  
youd think phillipe  and del toro are  going to pull out guns and scare them away but they dont  instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob  
theres a lot of things i didnt understand about this scene  first of all the owner of the mercedes isnt some yuppie or old rich snob  hes like a hippie straight out of the 60s  
secondly  the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed  
lastly  it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small countrys army  
if they were suicidal they wouldnt have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place  and where they get all those guns is never explained either   
theres a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility  
what it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems  which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is  
absolutely none of the characters are likable or believable  
and its all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flatout black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time  
with any film you see  whether you like it or not  you can at least understand what the appeal was to it  why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it  
i cant say either for  the way of the gun   because it has very little going for it and i cant imagine anyone intelligently defending it  
"
1	"at first glance  three kings looks to be just another war movie  the 90s version of all those favourite war movies with names i cannot remember  
the 90s version  it definitely is  just another war movie  
not in your dreams  
imagine pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan  thats three kings for you  
believe it or not  it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane meaning of the latter  
the story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war  with the allied troops victorious  
majpr archie gates  clooney  leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to a rather unorthodox postwar looting spree  the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away by saddam in a desolate village in the desert  
as the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be shipped home  this wild bunch goes awol on an armed humvee  the vehicle of choice of the us army   
they soon find out that they have much resistance  as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddams forces  
frequently switching their modes between looters and robin hoods merry men  they become consciously attacked by their own morals  
as the film begins to roll  it seemed to have a rather light mood to it  
special effects such as when gates describes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a lighthearted funny action movie  
three kings is much smarter than that  
as the conflict becomes more and more complex  the audience will be trapped in a limbo  trying to stay focussed on that lightmoodseriousmood that the film seem to portray  
i personally found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in the film  trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own sense of humanity  
this simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant  
action sequences are not shot as your oldfashioned war films nor anything like steven spielbergs inyourface war violence  
they are carefully built to generate tension with just the right tight closeups and pauses  right before the action starts  
not john woo for sure but more of sergio leones spaghetti western style  tons of them starring clint eastwood   
great performances by clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film  the screenwriter and the director  
three kings ranks among the best films of the year  well  for me at least  
highly recommended

0	"deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie  
this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises  and  being true to its title  being deceptive  
but there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit  
braxton  chris penn  and kennesaw  michael rooker  are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute  renee zellweger   
their lone suspect is wayland  tim roth   a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hookers pocket  
however  a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators  as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables  
braxton and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives  
braxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook  ellen burstyn   a local bookie  
kennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite  rosanna arquette   believing his wife to be unfaithful  
the plot is twisty and complex  with lots of lengthy flashbacks  and plenty of surprises  
however  there are times when it is needlessly complex  and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost  
take a look at l  a  confidential  or the films more likely inspiration  the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled  
the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot  
for example  the film tells a few substories  such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender  or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear   but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable  
theres never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation  
they appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay  
the characters  themselves  are rather pathetic and despicable  
not one of them is an ounce sympathetic  and as a result  the labyrinthine plot is all for naught  
what does it matter who is guilty of what and why  
writerdirectors josh and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers masterwork blood simple  or the wachowski brothers less worthy bound  
but  while they have got the plot twists down cold  they need to work on characterization and dialogue  
"
1	"well  ill admit when i first heard about this film  which was before dantes peak  i could just smell what twister had started  
so now it seems that were in a full fledged return to the 70s disaster film era  
with twister  dantes peak  volcano and soon flood and james camerons extremly expensive titanic 
ill say first off i enjoyed volcano much more than i did dantes peak  
part of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in  
ive been reading a lot about the movie being cheezy or hokey and really didnt see or think that once during the entire film  
i get bored easily and this film didnt bore me for a minute  
another thing  and boy am i bitching today   that bothers me is when critics and such go on about  well thats not really possible   
you know what  
i couldnt give a bloody damn if its possible or not  really i couldnt  
its a freaking movie and i dont want reality thrown in my face  
i want to be able to see the impossible  the all might  what if  to many reviewers have seen one to many movies  
the special effects are the second star to this feature  
they are so amazing that i found it hard sometimes to believe they were indeed fx and la was was not burning to the ground  
they did an incredible job and come oscar time  if they remember  some notice better be thrown there way

0	"yeah  yeah  the advertisements didnt even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook  sex  
neve campbell and starship troopers denise richards getting it on  
ok  
yeah  its a decent two minutes of film erotica  but even if thats your main interest in this film  theres plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes  
wild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however  
nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing  or at least curious to see the next turn  throughout the entire movie  
but this fastpaced  razorsharp turning of events doesnt leave much time to enjoy the surprises  
we start off in a highclass california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making  
guidance counselor sam lombardo  matt dillon  seems to catch the eye of every student  particularly kelly van ryan  richards   daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts  
right off the bat  kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce  mr  lombardo   
the fundraiser car wash seems the opportune time  particularly when you wash your guidance counselors jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure youll be soaked from head to toe when youre done  
on the weekend of the car wash  kellys attempts at seduction fall flat  and when they do  she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day  
naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations  
but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a lowclass  marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller  campbell  comes forth with a near identical story  also involving her trusted guidance counselor  
pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians  sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney  ken bowden  played by bill murray  
yes  that bill murray  
sound like a good  complete movie  
yes  that alone could have been  but this is just the beginning  
in fact  the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film  
it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time  
by the time the movie finishes  you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable  
unfortunately  with so much going on  youre not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about  
this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it couldve been  
the 113 minutes fly by  and although it never feels underdeveloped  this pretzel of storytelling couldve been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken  
the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox primetime soap operas  which no  is not a good thing  
and its not just campbell  who happens to hail from the primetime fox soap  party of five   but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones  
dillon  who was so charming in his understated role in last years in  out  gives the best performance  and murrays surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film  
in fact  if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy  even if it was the exact same film  i would actually give it a better grade  
thats how cheezy it comes off  
but aside from these two  the rest offer nothing more than some good eyefulls  
in the right hands  wild things couldve been a wickedly delightful  scrumptiously twisted thriller  but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting  
and whats up with these people passing as high school students  
i realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles  but when i realized it wasnt supposed to be a college they were at  i had to snicker  
i wont lie  this is definitely a guilty pleasure  
as corny as it is  its got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a  b  for effort  
but if you just want to admire denise richards  go for last years starship troopers  which was every bit as campy  but a million times better  
of course  if seeing her breasts is your most important goal  youll be right at home with wild things  
perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters

1	"the party is one of those classic slapstick comedies that will leave you  at times  cracking up  
the film takes place  for the most part  in realtime during an exclusive evening party that is attended only by the biggest names in hollywood  
hrundi v  bakshi  played very well by peter sellers  is a struggling actor who just came to america from his homeland  india  
hrundi tries out his acting talents  but it seems that he just isnt cut out for the job  
on the set of his current film that he stars in  hrundi seems to make everything go for the worse  
during the filming of this movie set in the 1800s  hrundi manages to annoy the director  herbert ellis  in any way he can  
this includes a pitiful acting job in many scenes  wearing an underwater watch in one scene  and accidentally detonating a massive set  
many of the hollywood producers and big names want hrundi out of the business forever  
and when the director makes a personal phone call to mr  clutterbuck  j  
edward mckinley  pleading for hrundis ejection from hollywood  everything is pretty much over for hrundi  
clutterbuck writes his name down on a piece of paper to insure that hrundi will never again work in hollywood  
but when this piece of paper turns out to be the guest list for clutterbucks exclusive party  hrundi is invited  and certain chaos is bound to occur  
of course  as predicted  hrundi causes lots of trouble  
each scene in which hrundi encounters a situation  usually one that he cant handle  is almost always very humorous  
and each scene with hrundi and the drunken waiter  who is alone hilarious  adds to the comedy in a great way  
the party can be compared to many other films of its type  specifically the trio of naked gun movies and the airplane movies  but the party is a delightful movie that incorporates very well played out comedy into believable situations  
it also includes a number of memorable scenes  can anyone say  birdy numnum     
if youre in the mood for fun and enjoyable slapstick comedy  check out the party  
its not going to be one of your alltime favorites  but if you enjoy this type of humor  youll enjoy the party  
"
1	"logical time travel movies are a nearimpossibility  
considering that the skeptics best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities  writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task  
occasionally  we get a film that does manage it  
terry gilliams  12 monkeys  was one such film  
but more frequently  we get films that dont much deal with it at all  
there is one question to ask in this case  does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies  
the  terminator  films made up for them with exciting action   back to the future  did it with an entertaining story  and the new film  frequency  pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own  
is  frequency  filled with plot holes  
yes  
does it matter  
not really  
the film opens in october of 1969  
firefighter frank sullivan  dennis quaid  puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job  then goes home to his loving wife julia  elizabeth mitchell  and son johnny  daniel henson   
the doublepronged story flashes forward to 1999  where johnny  now jim caviezel  is all grown up and working as a police detective  
a strange occurrence  the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city  allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in 69 and that john has found in the present day  
though both are initially skeptical of the idea  john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire  and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom  
now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive  john is initially overjoyed  until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous  a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women  
frank and john now must work together to set things right  with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past  
the premise of  frequency  is unusual  and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept  john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions  
this isnt explained  you just have to go with it  
when frank doesnt die in a fire  john is the only one who remembers it differently  while everyone else remembers it the new way  
the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities  1969 and 1999  are to each other  
sometimes franks changing the past results in something happening right away in johns world  and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time  
now  the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this  and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted  but nevertheless logical  if i thought about it hard enough  for example  the reason john gets advance information of the serial killers murders was because the change had already happened in franks world  and john is only witnessing the  projection  of that change   but explanations arent really the point  
when  frequency  gets cooking  its a riveting little thriller  even if it is confusing  
what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment  and  frequency  works as long as it keeps moving  
the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion  
director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure  frequency  as good hollywood entertainment  establishing decent  likable characters  making us care for them  and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved  
i liked many of the creative touches  the split screens  allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities  and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward  
it actually uses the 1969 metsorioles world series  the one that featured the amazin mets  to great effect  frank uses johns advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him  
  admittedly  this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself   
i even liked the final scene  which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods  
some may find this scene blindingly confusing  as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious  but it does make sense if you think about it  and give the script a lot of leeway   and lets face it  its a darn cool way to end the film  
there are enough surprises and plot twists in  frequency  to keep you on your toes  and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant  
the other major thing to appreciate about  frequency  is the handling of the fatherson relationship  
quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily  its a rocksolid job from both actors  
the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept  how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative  or with a future descendant  
watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question  
the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film  if we dont believe in the characters  we dont care about the outcome of the thriller plot  
here  we do care  because we like the lead actors  
i also liked some of the supporting cast members  
elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles  playing julia the doting wife  and  mother  but still performs admirably  
andre braugher  late of the television show  homicide  life on the street   gives a nice supporting turn as franks best friend and future colleague of john  
he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while franks world series predictions come true before his very eyes  
braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here  simultaneously dismayed and amused  
perhaps the only thing i didnt like about  frequency  is the overly sentimental coda  during which the cameras focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard  
but thats only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics  
i freely acknowledge that  frequency  may best work as a  guy  movie  since it focuses on the very maleoriented idea of fatherson relationships  echoes of  field of dreams  can be easily heard   but the underlying concept is universally applicable  
who wouldnt want to speak with a longdead parent  
or see how their children turn out  
  tell me about your life  son   excuse me while i mist up  
and dont call me a sissy

have to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight  the 7  floor is just a floor between 7 and 8  
he is hired by his 105 year old boss  orsen bean  to be a filer  
in his office  he discovers a little door  to which was boarded up and hidden  
to his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it  he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovichs mind  
fifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike  
he returns to tell his coworker maxine  catherine keener  that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovichs mind  she doesnt believe him but after she sees it it changes her mind  
lotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all  
john malkovich of course has no idea what is going on  and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and turns  that we dont know what really happened  
john cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play  
he fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast  
cameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the worlds most prettiest women  is made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive  
she however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date  
catherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage  to the master himself  
the whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever  
spike jonze  three kings  makes his fabulous directing debut  and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film  
he lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie  
by the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was  
the screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious and often thoughtprovoking  
the film also had a soft side to it and even though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heartwarming  
the whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles  
from cameron diazs appearence to john malkovichs explorations i laughed very hard  and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets  the funniest    
there isnt a slow point in the movie  or an overused idea  
there are no cliches except for the fact that this is the most original  inventie  witty  and smart movie ive seen in a long time  
i found myself amazed by everything  the direction  acting  writing and the whole idea of the movie  
by the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesnt want to make movies like this anymore  
or why they dont  
all filmmakers watch this movie and get some ideas of movies to come out  
this was a surprise hit as was american beauty  
being john malkovich is in the top 5 movies of the year  and in the top 10 best films ever made  
it has something that no other movies playing now has  
in fact it may as well be the best movie out right now  
i highly recommend being john malkovich and have no doubts you will be disappointed

1	"the rich mans wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double  where the story and characters are so onedimensional and contrived that you know you shouldnt be enjoying yourself  
but somehow  the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things  
not that its bad  its just that its been done before  and better  in my opinion  
i realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre  but its probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now  you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet  striving helplessly to get out  and instead of just flushing him  you end up kind of rooting for the little guy  
thats basically how i felt about this movie  
i mean  its not very good  but its not completely bad either  
the wife of the title is josie potenza  played nicely by halle berry   
she is married to tony  christopher mcdonald    you 
know  the guy who looks like joe piscapo   a really stressedout businessman who drinks way to much and doesnt give josie the attention she deserves   cough  cough    
thus  she is driven into the arms of another man  jake golden  clive owen   
near the beginning of the film  josie decides to try and work things out with tony by dumping jake and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods  
once there  however  tony has to leave almost immediately due to business details  im still not quite sure what line of work hes in   
making the best of her situation  josie stays there and begins making the rounds at the local bars  
one night  she meets a stranger named cole  peter greene  finally getting a meaty role   
they have dinner together  and eventually  both josie and the audience start to realize that cole is homicidal  
after learning that she is not happily married  cole offers to  take care  of the problem  
managing to escape from the psychotic maniac  josie returns home and starts a reconciliation with her estranged and very wealthy husband  
but then one night  cole shows up    
and here is where the fun begins  
from this point on  its going to be a noholds barred clichefest  ripping off every movie from strangers on a train to the usual suspects  
this is why most critics panned this movie when it first came out  
and for the most part  theyre right  the rich mans wife has nary one original bone in its body  
but who cares  
if youre looking for good ol dumb suspense movie  you cant do much better than this  
and if you suspense buffs arent already sold  it has a killer of an ending too

1	"life is beautiful is a rare treat  a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful  or  even worse  humorless  
it combines a charming romance with a dash of farce  stirs in a little poignancy  and ends up a very enjoyable movie  
its an italian film  but dont let that discourage you  
subtitlephobes will be missing a wonderful experience  
life is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy  with the clownish  but good natured guido  roberto benigni  arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle  
the year is 1939  and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams  dora  nicoletta braschi   
their romance seems to be picture perfect  with only one stumbling block  shes already engaged to another man  
can guido overcome the odds and win his girl  
what do you think  
however  five years later  things have taken a turn for the worse in italy  
the fascists have stepped up their race initiatives  which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue  giorgio cantarini   who are rounded up and shipped off to a concentration camp  
unable to protect his boy in any other way  guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp  
he pretends that everything is all an elaborate game  with points awarded for such tasks as hiding  being brave and being very very quiet  
as you can tell from the description  life is beautiful has two very different tones  but manages to excel at both of them  
as a romantic comedy  it is sweet and funny  
as a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair  it is touching  
roberto benignis work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplins  and it is easy to see why  
he is able to run the gamut of comic expression  from slapstick to farce  with a warmhearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden heros  triumph of the underdog  spirit  
life is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust  
however  it is able to successfully navigate the minefield  without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved  nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears  
with life is beautiful  benigni has created a triumphant  but bittersweet comedy  
its quite simply one of the most enjoyable times ive had at the movies this year

0	"capsule  this superlight situation comedy from sweden tells the story of two close friends with romantic problems  
the script involves formerly taboo subjects like erotic toys and sexual enhancers but otherwise the writing is not a lot different from what is shown free on television  
the characters are paperthin and the interesting ideas purely nonexistent  
this is a decrementlifeby90minutes card  
  0  4 to 4  
jalla  jalla  
is basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead for the wide screen  
it tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love  
the film is set in sweden where roro and mans  fares fares and torkel petersson  are custodians at a public park  roro is from a tightly knit lebanese family who control him very closely  mans is a swede from a much more liberal background  
they spend most of the day in the bushes at their park  cleaning up after dogs  
roro and mans each have girlfriends  but each has a problem  
roro  nicknamed  jalla   is having family problems  
it seems that his family wants to arrange a marriage between him and a nice lebanese woman  yasmin  laleh pourkarim   but he is already in love with lisa  tuva novotny   
yasmin likes roro  but does not want to get married either  
mans on the other hand has been having a problem of sexual impotence  
the two friends worry about their problems and discuss the problems with each other  
mans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers  
the one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy them  
roro and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other  but then plan to break up before the wedding  
not too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected  
the plot turns in several places are contrived  
one knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen  
lebaneseborn josef fares who wrote and directed is perhaps a better director than he is a writer  
when things start to get slow  he just adds throws in another story  
for example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and a long chase is added to the film  
characterization is a little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have a whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing a biological function  
we do see some of roros family life and his concerns  
that may be because roros background is a lot like that of the director  
while the story was entertaining  i did not feel that i got anything worthwhile from the film  
it was just a way to pass about an hour and a half in my life  
one does not have to go to the movies to see entertainment like this  
i rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale

0	"the swirling sick feeling hit me just a few minutes into  heartbreakers   
ray liottas character was making out with his secretary when his new wife knocked on the door of his office  
while scrambling to collect himself  he frantically shouted to her   just wait a sex  er  i mean sec   
i was struck by a wave of revulsion  thinking   geez  didnt lines like that die when threes company was canceled   
over the next few minutes  as the barely double entendres and lingering cleavage shots grew more numerous  i realized that the mindset behind  heartbreakers  predated  threes company   
suddenly  i had an outofbody experience as my internal wayback machine swept me to the mid1960s  
all across america  the counterculture was growing like wildfire  but there was scant evidence of it on tv  
while young people were challenging traditional values on the streets  frustrated teenagers like me were stuck at home  sulking while our parents enjoyed the latest bob hope special  
women in skimpy bathing suits would prance onscreen while hope made growling noises and leered at their breasts  
on another channel  dean martin made wisecracks about  booze and broads  and peter lawford  decked out in love beads and a nehru jacket  purred suggestive oneliners as he ogled the gogo dancers  
the adults laughed and laughed  
  heartbreakers  reeks of that stagnant mentality  from its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitts vahvahvoom breasts to its leaden screenplay  which paints women as haughty schemers and men as drooling buffoons too sexobsessed to realize they are being manipulated  
in addition to liotta and hewitt  the cast includes sigourney weaver  gene hackman  jason lee  nora dunn and anne bancroft  
i cant imagine what drew performers of their caliber to this project  
perhaps they thought it was a parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the 60s  
if so  they were sadly mistaken  
the story revolves around a motherdaughter conteam  
it opens with the marriage of max  weaver  to dean  liotta   a new jersey chop shop operator  
having withheld sex until the honeymoon  max pretends to pass out on their wedding night  
the next morning  she feigns illness  sending a very horny dean off to the office  where he ends up in the arms of his new secretary  
just as the two are about to get overtly physical  max bursts into the room and catches them  
the  horrified  bride dissolves the union  garnering a healthy cash settlement along the way  
of course  the secretary was really her daughter page  hewitt  and the whole thing was a setup  
the women move on  but an irs agent  bancroft  catches up with them and demands a huge amount of money to cover unpaid taxes  
in desperate need of funds  max and page head for palm beach to replay the scam  
their mark this time is william b  tensy  hackman  in hideous makeup   a decrepit tobacco tycoon obsessed with the joys of smoking  
max starts to put the game into action  but page is so repelled by the old man  and angry with her mom  that she slips off to enact her own score  targeting jack  a laid back young beach bar owner who is worth a fortune  
complications arise when page realizes that goodnatured jack is stirring actual emotions in her steely little heart  
as if that wasnt enough  dean reappears on the scene with revenge on his mind  
the attempt to weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind me of the infinitely superior  a fish called wanda   
i wont bother to compare the two  
suffice to say that everything done right in  wanda  is done wrong here  
  heartbreakers  is soulless  inept and  at 123 minutes  at least a halfhour too long  
sigourney weaver and jennifer love hewitt throw themselves into their parts  but have nowhere to go with the metallic characters  
gene hackman is utterly wasted in a onenote  onejoke part that has him doing nothing but smoking  coughing and waxing rhapsodic about smoking and sex  
poor jason lee is stuck in the ingenue role and the normally charismatic actor comes off as merely bland  
ray liotta manages to squeeze a tiny bit of humanity and humor into his walking clich   but only a bit  
the low point in the film has weaver employing a russian accent bad enough to make boris and natasha wince  while doing halfassed slapstick with a broken off penis from a statue  
bear in mind  though  that this is merely the worst segment of a movie made up of nothing but low points  
if you remember bob hope specials with fondness  this might be your cup of tea  
as for me  im going to watch  a fish called wanda  now and try to forget i ever saw  heartbreakers   
"
0	"of course i knew this going in  
why is it that whenever a tvstar makes a movie its always a romantic comedy  and then they say on entertainment tonight or something  that they were  attracted to the characters  
they were really original   
original   let me give you a runthrough of picture perfect  character a  kate  jennifer aniston  from tvs friends   a smart  beautiful  professional woman wants two things she cant have  a new jobtitle and the love of her coworker kevin bacon  
her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar  and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls  
what does she do  
she invents a fiance  
then when everyone wants to meet him  she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him 1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner  and pick a fight with her at the end  thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job  since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor  defenceless female  
he  of course  goes along with it  
gee  i wonder if they get together in the end  
ive seen more original stuff on the wb  
and better stuff too  
picture perfect also makes the mistake of being wayyyyy too long at 100 minutes  and expecting us to like anistons character  who comes off as a cold  spoiled bitch  
"
0	"one of these days  ill make good on my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie  
king of new york and body snatchers notwithstanding  and bad lieutenant is only fit for a single  emotive viewing   his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary arthouse trappings  
its a perfumedrenched  cokeaddled visit to the seedy pornography shop  where beautiful models  no  hookers  no  courtesans  usher you through the silk curtains  
ferraras only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over and over again  since walken can make a good movie great and a loathsome movie durable whenever hes onscreen  
his 8minute scene in the addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal  unwatchable  and pretentious failure  
when he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements  or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch  theres a muchneeded dose of humor in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair  
you know those gothic club kids who are too cool to smile and let you know theyre actually having fun  
the addiction is that movie  
walken  sadly  does not appear in the blackout  
the central role of matty  a junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction  is played by matthew modine  who takes what he can get after cutthroat island   
much like the protagonists of michelangelo antonionis terminally bored cultural elite  matty is involved in a bitter pill  relationship  with high fashioned model annie  at least i think shes a model   
mattys lady is played by french actress b  atrice dalle  arrested twice for cocaine possession during filming of the blackout  not that you needed to know that  but it lends credence to the idea that ferraras entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout  
no kidding  
requiem for a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferraras movies and his controversial urban lifestyle  
matty and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him  
no doubt  he was off chasing the dragon  
in his despair  matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery  tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne  dennis hopper  in full  dirty ol man  mold smacking models on the ass and telling them to spread their legs  
wider   
toward the end of the night  they pick up a teenage waitress also named annie  sarah lassez   start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene  then matty thankfully blacks out  
something happened that night which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie  and its exactly what you think it was  
suffice to say  theres some confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two  or anyone at all  
the blackout is typical ferrara  no plot to speak of  plenty of raunch  and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels and a beer while wrapping himself in a seethrough curtain in his hotel room by the sea  by the sea  by the beautiful sea  
cinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets with docustyle sleaze  and were back to dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits  
  yeah    
yeah    
arrrghhh   
says mr  hopper  
dirty old sod   
its compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way  leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny  
hows that for cryptic  
never fear  ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what hes all about  
i can picture it now  
  take off yer clothes  kid  its essential to depict the inner maelstrom of my central protagonist  and youre his visual id  
youre the soul  the heart  the bloodstream of the picture  
take it off  
take it all off    
ha ha ha   
friggin vampire  
yeah  you  ferrara  
a final word about matthew modine  hes actually a fine actor when properly cast  but theres something too squeakyclean in his demeanor  
hes ideally suited for sarcastic men in tightly controlled situations  such as his private joker in full metal jacket or the timebomb nebbish in short cuts  who is every bit as superb as julianne moore in that famous scene  though no one seems to notice him   
he was in that scene  
ed   
here  hes asked to let it all hang out  sporting a threeday stubble and oily bangs  
he throws around furniture like stanley kowalski  but its somehow lacking  
modine lacks the feral intensity of brando  entirely miscast in ferraras flesh fair  
better luck next time  matt  
someday  youll be forgiven for cutthroat island  which wasnt really your fault in the first place  
maybe atom egoyan will find a place for you somewhere  and all will once again be well in your world

0	"call it a road trip for the walking wounded  
stellan skarsg  rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that its difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly  boozedout presence  
yet this everreliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen  a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama  
playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets  unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late  
thats an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for  focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father  tomas  skarsg  rd  and his alienated  openly hostile yuppie daughter  kaisa  lena headey  gossip   
they havent spoken in years  and wouldnt even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen  scotland by automobile if it werent for kaisas mother  charlotte rampling  under the sand  rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer  
in a soap opera twist  mother has only a few days to live  
  only in the movies  right   
too blitzed to even step foot on a plane  tomas hits the open road with kaisa  
loathing each other all the while  they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out  whenever he isnt muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be  
despite his sloshed viewpoint  tomas recognizes that the apple hasnt fallen very far from the tree  
kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke  sabotages her personal relationships through indifference  and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper  
aint they a pair  
unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the onenote and repetitively bitchy dialogue  screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward  lost money  roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around  nosy cops  and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative  
by the time they reach the hospital  its time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the fatherdaughter conflict  theyre also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe  
this revelation exists purely for its own sake  
aberdeen doesnt know where else to go  
weak  unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa  
if lena headey were a stronger actress  perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody  haunting cinematography  rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world  the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional   
headeys too busy acting  using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance  
if she were paying any attention to skarsg  rd  maybe shed figure out that doing less can reveal so much more  
its worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001  jonathan nossiters captivating signs  wonders  
its not just because skarsg  rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films  theyre not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen   
the differences in the way their characters were presented is significant  
in aberdeen  rampling is a luminous diva  preening and static in her hospital bed  
despite skarsg  rds solid performance as tomas  his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow  
theres genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs  wonders  allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity  
nossiters film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain  
if signs  wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas  at least its willing to stretch beyond what weve come to expect from traditional drama  
aberdeen is never half so ambitious  content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies  
when did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life  
the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdans trite but occasionally useful grand canyon  where steve martins hollywood mogul pronounces   all of lifes riddles are answered in the movies   
even foreign films are taking that advice to heart  
"
1	"note  ordinarily  moviereviews  org will not give away any critical plot points of a film that could be interpreted as  spoilers   
however  being that music of the heart is based on a true story and that moviereviews  org 
feels the film can not be properly credited without such revelations  plot giveaways will appear in the following review  
if this bothers you  please note the 3 star rating of the film and stop reading now  
  what does it take to play carnegie hall  
practice   
it takes two hours for music of the heart to  play carnegie hall   both figuratively and literally  
like the children it portrays  the movie starts from the dark realms of awful cinema and works its way up to a showstopping performance at the legendary concert hall  
roberta guaspari  academy award winner meryl streep  has two kids  a husband who left her and 50 violins she bought from a small shop in the mediterranean  
her life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school  
she soon finds her job is on the rocks as the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors  
that is the patternlike plot of this production  
ultimately  the film chooses a zerosum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an alltime high when the men in her life finally vanish  
the first hour of music of the heart is rather painful  
robertas character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat  
also lacking depth is the films  bad guy   a narrowminded music teacher  josh pais  who rejects roberta out of principle  the movie never explains exactly which principle that is  and conveniently comes and goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a villain around  
the next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre  
they are highlighted by one childs return to robertas class  coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be cant be around anymore because  my mom said      and a glowing concert  
not knowing the running time  you may expect the credits to role at this point  
but they dont  
instead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent  
director wes craven  known for his works of horror  uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing  
one romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic  but    
last night     
and robertas two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their fathers absence  
the city of harlem plays a strong role in the movie  
robertas mother is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype  
the noise tracks for these scenes are dominated by sirens  predictably one of robertas students is gunned down and killed off screen  
one thing the film does lack is subtlety  
the fact that a little boy was playing  we shall overcome  on his violin after the aforementioned shooting was a cute and discreet reference  
the fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience  
  of course  in horror films the foreshadowing and betweentheline moments are meant to be overdone  so perhaps he too is just learning to play the game   
even with all its flaws  music of the heart is a beautiful film  
that is not an excuse for the movies poor beginning  
but as i watched the scenes in carnegie hall  i thought of some of the great acts that have taken that stage  
in december of 1979 a comedian named andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history  
the performance included a deadon elvis impression  robin williams in disguise and a moment at the end when kaufman announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies  
so  how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life  
he had a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating and angering the audience  
perhaps it is okay for music of the heart to start off rusty because just as kaufman had santas favorite food  this movie has an amazing finale  
"
1	"a miracle of filmmaking   some like it hot  is a brilliant film  and maybe the foremost example of slapstick comedy brought to screen with clever sight gags and plot twists  
it is the pinnacle of writerdirector billy wilders career  a stunning feat considering the vast catalogue of films he had helped make  
jerry  lemmon  and joe  curtis  are two stage musicians who go from gig to gig  trying to earn enough money to feed themselves  
one night  as theyre playing at a banned prohibition speakeasy  the place is raided  
as it turns out  the owner  spats columbo  george raft  was ratted out by toothpick charlie  george e  stone   
several weeks later  on valentines day  jerry and joe go to a garage to pick up a car and end up witnessing a gangland murder of charlie by columbo in a parking garage  
eager to escape  the duo are forced to take a job in florida with all expenses paid  
the only catch   its a girls band  
so josephine  curtis  and daphne  lemmon   make their way onto the train and go to florida  
on the way there  they meet sugar kane  monroe   a bombshell singer who is looking for love  
jerry and joe immediately fall for the singer  but theres two problems  1  theyre in drag  and 2  millionaire osgood fielding  joe e  brown  falls madly in love with daphne  
what follows in pure hysteria  still complicated further by the arrival of spats columbo to florida for the  italian opera lovers festival   
tony curtis is hysterical as joejosephine  especially in his preposterous attempts to woo sugar  
marilyn monroe  in a wonderfully comic performance  is sugar  providing incredible timing and sex appeal  along with true sincerity  
the scenes  however  are all stolen by either brown or lemmon  
lemmon is hysterical as daphne  
cast as the less rational one  lemmons performance is ridiculously crazy  it is disorder in the style all billy wilders  
brown is particularly hilarious as osgood  as we are treated to the finest kind of comedic irony  
he manages to use lemmons ingenious performance as a springboard for an even loonier performance as a completely eccentric millionaire  
every setpiece is flawless  as wilder brilliantly changes settings constantly  and uses every comic trick in the book to make his picture  
wilders script is stunning  as he carefully combines gangsters  crossdressing  romance  sex  music  gender roles  and social taboos in a riotous blend of wit and oddball craziness  
wilder manages to create scenes of utter hysteria  so pitchperfect that the audience is dying of laughter with the last comic piece  the final line of this absolutely incredible film  
wilders is dead wrong when he says nobodys perfect  billy wilder is  especially when he makes something this disastrously funny  
nobodys perfect but billy wilder

0	"bad  bad  
bad  
that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls  
if that summary isnt enough for you  how about ta  ta  ta  
still havent got the point  
other than director russ meyers predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the aforementioned anatomical areas  there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie  
that is the fact that it was cowritten by famed film critic roger ebert  who also was responsible for the screenplay  
after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face  
this movie stinks out loud  
quite frankly  this movie deserves a  
but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny  
so im giving it a  
and maybe that is too generous  
right from the opening credits  i knew that i had a classa bomb on my hands  
not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting  but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform  
i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening  it does get explained later  and as soon as the first scene is over  we cut to a completely unrelated scene  
to be honest  as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was  i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film  
with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film  it wouldnt have surprised me if the opening had never been explained  
so what is this movie about  
you ask  
like it really matters  
ok  here goes  
this allgirl band headed by kelly macnamara  dolly reed  and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry  
once there  they do manage to find success  due as much to their hooters as anything else  it sure wasnt for their brutally bad singing voices   and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them  
everything from big egos  to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral  
there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure  but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing  
from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here  
other than the abovementioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have  
the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts  
mr  ebert has generously thrown in helpings of  hey man    dig  and my all time favorite   this is my happening  and it freaks me out   
now i ask you  with lines like that how can you go wrong  
ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue  
maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter  
i dont know  but all the big words in the world wouldnt be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting  
but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie  
ive seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey  
in fact  there is one scene  the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes  during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries  
add to the directing and writing the music in this movie  
i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken  there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers  
then we have the cast  
first lets start david gurian who played harris  the manager of the band  
this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera  
sadly  his acting doesnt come close to making up for his looks  
if you have been following along up to this point  this shouldnt surprise you  
meyers stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets  
dolly reed plays kelly  the leader of the band  
and no surprise here  she was cast for her cup size  not her talents  
and yes  she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents  
sadly  her ass is almost as large as her chest  
hey  it a sexist movie  so im writing a sexist review  
then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey  one of the other band members  
this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie  
meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all  but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all  
sure russ  now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows  
on the up side  she does have a fun lesbo scene  
i sound like im writing a review in a porn magazine  
but hey  ill admit it  the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked  
and since that was a huge disappointment  i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey  
the only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it  
unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too  
and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double ds  you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet  
this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs  
an even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls  beware  this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense  
proceed with extreme caution

1	"martin scorseses triumphant adaptation of edith whartons the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker  the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life  
it seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900s  but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder  and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker  
this is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorseses finest  
newland archer  daylewis  is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland  ryder   a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker  who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful  
the marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families  in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others  
on the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may  countess ellen olenska  pfeiffer   cousin of may  walks into archers life  
archer is immediately captivated  and finds himself in love with ellen  
archer is also bound by the limits of new york society  which is an intrusive as any other in the world  
archer finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska  attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status  
the films subject matter may seem alien to scorsese  but the theme is definitely not  
it is a theme of forbidden romance  guilty pleasures  and the consequences causes because of those actions  
there is a painstakingly flawed hero  and his choice between the life he wants  and the life he is destined for  
in truth  it is a film about a society the audience doesnt know about  but wants to find out more  much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun  
the performances are absolutely breathtaking  
daylewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take  
pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska  a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well  
ryder is probably the gem of the group  for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot  and slowly pushes daylewis closer and closer to his eventual ending  
the supporting cast is also wonderful  with several characters so singular that they are indelible in ones memory  
scorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking  
his lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight  
he literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery  
his script is also excellent  slow in buildup  with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed  
it is difficult to make a period piece gripping  scorsese  however  does it beautifully  
the famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere  
he is patient  but he films everything and anything remotely important  
the cameras sweep  pan  track  and do more than theyve ever done  but they are so subtle  one doesnt realize hes watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing  
the central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot  but the viewer doesnt notice it  because we want to see more of this gorgeous world  
there are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding  and joanne woodward narration is exquisite  
not a fast film like goodfellas  this shares more in common with kundun than anything else  
and like kundun  this is a slowstarting film that truly shines  when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end  
a beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year

1	"most movies seem to release a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy  
rocky iii seems to kind of fit in that category  but manages to be slightly unique  
the rocky formula of  rocky loses fightrocky trainsrocky wins fight  is carried out to the letter  
also the tradition of showing the last five minutes or so from the past rocky film is used as well  
this movie begins with a series of clips showing how famous rocky  sylvester stallone  has become    
even showing a brief appearance on sesame street   
then it moves on with rocky being in a fixed fight with thunderlips  hulk hogan   
a mysterious badass known as clubber lang  mr  t  trashtalks to rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing and that he  pities the fool  for not coming out and fighting him outright  
rockys trainer  burgess meredith  tells rocky not to fight  but the italian stallion doesnt listen  
naturally  he gets his ass kicked  
somewhere along the line after this several things happen  
rockys longtime trainer dies  causing rocky to train with his former opponent apollo creed  
rockys wife complains to her husband that he should fight  
the final fight ensues between clubber and rocky  
guess who wins  
the winners name rhymes with smocky  
the movie is entertaning mainly because of clubber langs over the top performance  
the dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since rocky ii and now action seems to be the strong point of the film  
which is good if you like fighting scenes  
the last match is quite decent actually  
if you liked the previous films  rent this one  
its well worth seeing if you are a fan of the series  
but if you cant stand rocky shouting  adrianne     
one more time  see something else

0	"its now the anniversary of the slayings of julie james  jennifer love hewitt  best friends  
still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all  she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown  
she cant concentrate on her schoolwork  cant get a good nights sleep  and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club  
everywhere she looks  she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand  
in the first movie  i know what you did last summer  julie and three of her friends accidentally kill a man  running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway  
to cover their misdeed  they dump the body into the ocean  
however  he never quite died and returned to hunt down julie and her friends  
julie and one other  ray  freddie prinze jr    survived only to make this dismal sequal  
needing some desparate rest and relaxation  she is elated to learn that her college roommate  karla  brandy   has won a trip for four to a secluded tropical island  
accompanying these two girls are karlas overbearing boyfriend  tyrell  mehki phifer  and a potential beau for julie  
but was this contest too good to be true  
the resort is filled with a skeleton staff that seemed like love boat rejects  
meanwhile  the hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin  
this presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded and will have no possible means off the island  
eventually  they will be hunted down during power outages and chased around during intense lightning storms  
as you might have guessed  somewhere in the shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker and wielding a hook  
julie tries to convince her friends that the killer is on the island  an eerie touch is when she is singing  i will survive  at the karaoke bar and the words scroll  i still know       but her friends chalk it up to paranoia  
but the body count soon starts to rise  and for julie  its going to be the worst vacation of her life  
the funny  yes  i used the word funny  thing about this movie is that i heard more chortling and giggling  maybe it was my giggling  than i heard screaming  
this movie boils down to a mindless slashfest that never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky campiness  
there isnt even any suspense that leads up to the deaths  
heres an appropriate example  
knockknock  
  housekeeping   says the diminuitive cleaning lady  
the door suddenly opens up  
slash  
next victim  
is there any reason to go and see this movie  
not unless you want to see four uninteresting college kids run around in circles for about 90 minutes  
but i do want to say one thing about this movie that satisfied me  
i was thoroughly irritated with tyrell  who incessantly ranted and raved about his sexual libido  
i secretly wished for him to get filleted  
did he get hooked  
well  lets just say that if he didnt  i would give this film a grade of  d

1	"youve got to love disney  
no matter what they serve up  it is a guaranteed success as long as its animated  
kids have to go see the movie  
then they have to get the toys  
oh  the video came out  
got to buy it  or risk little billys temper tantrums for the next month  
all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca  a visit to the magic kingdom  
stay at the disneyland hotel  
buy a disney tshirt  
eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick  
its both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it  
dale carnegie should have had it so good  
whats most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality  
you see  disney animated features these days have two components  theme and plot  
the theme changes with each new movie  the plot does not  
the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped  and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features  they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same  
however  while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as boxoffice receipts  merchandising dollars  and glimmers in the eyes of little children  critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer  
luckily  disneys latest animated offering  mulan  manages to be engaging and refreshing  even while rife with formula  
the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns  led by the imposing shanyu  miguel ferrer   
soon  chinas emperor  pat morita  mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in chinas defense  
when the fa family is served notice  it is the elderly father  fa zhou  soontek oh  who must answer the call  as there are no other males in the household  
fearing her father will surely be killed in battle  fa mulan  mingna wen  disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army  
mulan  based on a chinese epic poem  is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling  
mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family  as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional womans role  and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband  we see that  grace  is not one of her strong points  
very early on  we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to ones family  and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker  mulan fails at that task  
by leaving home to fight in her fathers place  she may not only spare his life  but bring honor  too  
as is the case with most disney musicals  the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film  
im not sure if they will get much airplay  but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time  
both lea salonga  who provides the singing voice for mulan  and donny osmond who sings for shang  the captain of mulans army unit and obligatory love interest  are more than competent  although salongas voice translates much better to animation  
you have to hear it to understand  
interestingly  the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan  
there is no significantly big number  which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film  but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie  
it is  however  an expectation which has been built by disneys own formulaic history  and some viewers may feel as if something is missing  
artistically  the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork  and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works  it helps to contribute a more authentic  and therefore more credible  nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically  disneyfied  ethnic tale  
there are also a couple of visually standout scenes  one involving the charge of shanyus hun army  which utilizes the same computerenhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast  
the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it  
when mulan resolves to take her fathers place  she dons her fathers old battle armor  and unsheathes a sword  
as she does so  you can see her reflection in the polished metal  
it just left me thinking   that was really cool   
a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film  varying from the straight  such as soontek oh as fa zhou  to the comical  such as harvey fierstein as yao  a gruff  pugilistic member of shangs conscripted army  
even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu  the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan  
although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin  murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance  
i found the choice of b  d  
wong as shang a little strange  you may remember him as martin shorts wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride   but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast  so i guess anythings possible  
in any event  wong performs admirably as well  
one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa  
she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie  but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people  
june foray  who supplies grandmother fas speaking voice  is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale  as in boris and natasha   
marni nixon  who provides grandmother fas singing voice  is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i  maria in west side story  and eliza in my fair lady  
with this in mind  hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history  
mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films  
in an effort to be culturally sensitive  and to avoid a  miss saigon  type debacle   disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asianamerican actors for both lead and supporting roles  
in addition to the actors already mentioned  the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong  gedde watanabe  james shigeta  and george takei  
i guess clyde kusatsu wasnt available  
at a running time of slightly under an hour and a half  mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and  happily  adults  
this is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next  rather than hope that the next one is better

0	"plot  based on the wildly popular  jerry springer  tv show  this movie follows the lives of two groups of people before they make their bizarre appearances on the infamous program  
one posse comes from the trailer parks and are to be featured in the  i slept with my stepfather  segment  and the other is based on some flygirl whose girlfriends keep sleeping with her undevoted  dog  boyfriend  
critique  the truth is that if i didnt have a day job  i would probably watch the real  jerry springer  show every day  
i find it quite entertaining  despite its complete lack of redeeming value  
having said that  the show itself is outrageous  funny  and always filled with goofy surprises  as opposed to this film which features no laughs  is this a comedy or a drama    uninteresting and completely unbelievable onedimensional stereotypes  and a contrived plot which bores us stupid all the way  
i never thought i would utter the word boring in the same sentence as jerry springer  but this film is an absolute yawnfest  despite offering various scenes featuring simulated blowjobs  lesbians  ta and tv violence  who wouldve guessed that    
i wish they would have either a  made this movie much  much funnier  or b  turned it into a complete drama and given us a real perspective as to why people like this actually put themselves through these public forums of embarrassment  
unfortunately  it doesnt seem as though screenwriter jon bernstein spent more than a drunken weekend watching real  jerry springer  reruns to complete his script  leaving us with a boring film  featuring no laughs  onedimensional characters  and no fun whatsoever  
little known facts about this film and its stars  jerry springer used to be the mayor of cincinnati  ohio  
for this film  he won the 1999 razzie award for worst new star  tied with joe esterhas from an alan smithee film  burn hollywood burn  
"
0	"it seemed like the perfect concept  
what better for the farrelly brothers  famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter  than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality  
its exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish  poking fun at something serious  in this case mental illness   throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh  
jim carreys signed on too  
even better  
the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers new film before its opening  claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality  labeling it incorrectly as  schizophrenia   and so forth  
such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would  of course  only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers fire  proving that some people just couldnt take a joke  and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy  
yes  it all seemed perfect  but one thing went wrong  their movie isnt funny  
its not for lack of trying  
the farrellys utilize in  me  myself  irene  their most highconcept premise ever  carrey plays charlie baileygaites  a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver  decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them  
this  of course  means all his neighbors exploit his entirely tooforgiving nature  making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult  
soon enough  charlies repressed aggression manifests itself into a second  independent personality named hank  a deepvoiced  boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster  
this guy isnt above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which hes been insulted  or holding a little girls head underwater because she refused to stop jumproping in the street  
then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted  and the film runs off its tracks  
some have suggested that this isnt a problem  because the farrelly brothers brand of humor doesnt require plot to work  
theyre wrong  of course  plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort  1996s  theres something about mary   
  1999s  outside providence  was technically an earlier project   
the brothers earlier film wasnt funny merely because it contained outrageous gags  despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe   but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected  
in  mary   the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleightofhand trick  theyd have you thinking the story was going one way  then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion  
  me  myself  irene   by contrast  seems to have been made by folks who looked at  mary  and saw only the surface grossness  missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work  
having been produced by the same guys who made  mary    irene  seems like an even bigger disappointment  
the brothers pile on the offensive humor  taking shots at race  midgets  albinos  mental illness  and all manner of bathroom jokes  
but they havent come up with a way to make any of it fresh  most of  me  myself  irene  comes off as rote  bythenumbers  adolescent comedy  
the plot  with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p  waters  renee zellweger   whos in more trouble than anyone knows  back to new york  has an ending thats entirely predictable from the getgo  
  think charlie and irene will fall in love  
yeah  me too   
the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters  and none of them ever manage to do anything you havent already expected them to do  no matter how outrageous their actions might be  
compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing  this stuff is almost entirely softtossed  presenting an obvious problem  when grossout humor loses its shock value  its no longer funny  merely gross  
the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry  
take  for example  the subplot involving charlies three black sons  anthony anderson  mongo brownlee  jerod mixon   
the incongruity of it all is funny for a while  with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and whitebread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely toopleasant smile on his face  
but by the end of the film  theyre still doing the same schitck  it hasnt been elevated to another  funnier level  and it hasnt been dropped either  
thats too bad  because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through  
  me  myself  irene  reeks of wasted opportunities  
there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlies new personality  and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hanks actions  
this doesnt really happen  nearly every supporting character learns about charlies condition early on  so they dont have any opportunity to be surprised by it  
the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point  involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called  appropriately   whitey    but the script doesnt go anywhere with it  instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax  
jim carrey is a gifted comedian  both physically and vocally  but hes left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in  all of me   
its a great showcase of flexibility and splitsecond roleshifting  but none of it is terribly funny  
carrey doesnt pull any stunts we dont expect him to pull  and the farrellys script doesnt give him anything else to pull  the situations in which he must perform the roleshifting arent set up in any meaningful way  
perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better  
zellwegers irene is not a strong female lead  mary in  mary  may have been part adolescent fantasy  but she was also intelligent and strongwilled  
irene is nothing in particular  as the film never makes clear whether shes ditzy  clever  or neither  
as such  she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only  sane  person in the film  
chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent  and his character is entirely too straightlaced for a movie like this  
he  like the others  does absolutely nothing unexpected  
after viewing the shapeless mess that  me  myself  irene  eventually dissolved into  i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves  
maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked  
but i dont believe it  good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style  
if the farrellys are indeed good  smart filmmakers  and i still think they are   theyll rebound just fine  
even after that happens  though  ill still consider  me  myself  irene  to be a highcaliber misfire

0	"  mission to mars  is one of those annoying movies where  in the middle of the movie  you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so good is because they showcased all the best parts of the movie  all five minutes of it  
  mission   does  give you payoff  but when it does come  its too little  too late  
  mission  has some good ideas  but they get lost in the unbearably boring delivery  dimeadozen dialogue  and spate of good actors wasted in cardboardcutout roles  
im sure the director and writers were very proud of each hallmark moment they came up with  so they stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until it loses all its charm  
glances dont communicate any deeper emotions just because you draw them out for five hours on end  
the film spends an hour on this kind of stuff  building to its climax  
a lot of it is a cliched glorification of family relationships  marriage  friendship  unite we stand divided we fall kind of crap  
there are some spectacular special effects sequences in this film  and i give it points for trying to stay true to the science i know  trying is the key word here   
the sequence with the martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautiful and touching  but as mentioned by then were so sick of the goddamn thing we want the movie to be over  
great design  good intentions  but no cigar  
if youre not a die hard scifi  fx or jerry oconnell fan  his character is the only one who has some semblance of character   dont waste your eight bucks on this  
and what the hell  tim robbins died halfway through the movie  in a stupid way too  
thats just unforgiveable

1	"sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest  
some people call it  original  or  artsy  or  abstract   
some people simply call it  trash   
a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings  
definitely a generationx aimed movie  a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaokebased musical dream sequence  
whew  
anyone in their 30s or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film  
its somewhat silly  its somewhat outrageous  and its definitely not your typical romance story  but for the right audience  it works  
a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting  
well sorry folks  but i havent seen trainspotting so i cant really compare  
whether that works in this films favor or not is beyond me  
but i do know this  ewan mcgregor  whom i had never had the pleasure of watching  definitely charmed me  
he was great  
cameron diazs character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp  
the audience may find it difficult to care about her  thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him  
misguided  
you bet  
loveable  
you bet  
a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city  utah  
this was just one more thing i didnt know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke  
maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise  but i think even if i had known  i would have been just as happy  
a life less ordinary is quirky  eccentric  and downright charming  
not for everyone  but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies  
"
1	"its an interesting premise  
our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real  
in truth  our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains  
what we see  what we do  everything around us is nothing more than a computergenerated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence  
our bodies  severely atrophied  are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet  
the scifi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along  
the matrix isnt it  the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network  a sham world  the ability to plug ones brain into a computer  has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator  dark city  and a few star trek episodes  both classic and next generation   
what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thoughtprovoking  
keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo  who is plucked out of the artificial world  known as the matrix  by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computergenerated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines  
the groups leader  morpheus  laurence fishburne   has chosen neo because he believes neo is  the one  who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence  
from the beginning of the film  we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out  
this  in a lesser movie would be annoying  but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun  
what is reality  
what is a sham  
the film turns our very perception of life on its side  
more than once  we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality  or live a life of relative bliss  oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings  
as viewers  this is intriguing enough  so imagine what it would be like for neo  
and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves  
reeves  whom ive never really cared for as an actor  is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness  and little subtlety  
he was good in speed  for example  but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds  
neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely  so much of my expectation was happily for naught  
in a couple of places  the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature  and this is a heavy credit to writersdirectors andy and larry wachowski  
i mean  since bill and teds excellent adventure  what movie could you say really  utilized  keanu reeves  
more interesting than reeves is fishburne  whos morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions  and convincingly so  
very surprising for a scifi movie  
fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout  as if he always knows what to expect  
this helps to further the aura of his characters proficiency and extensive knowledge  
hugo weaving as agent smith  one of the artificial intelligences antiintruder programs  is also good playing his deadpan  nononsense  kick ass role  which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time  
unfortunately  when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row  the nature of his characters speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive  
carrieanne moss plays trinity  morpheuss number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo  
although her character is somewhat inconsistent  moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isnt in the picture  
there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects  
many methods of imagery are employed  from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics  
of special note is the use of the  freeze and turn  effect where the entire scene is frozen  turned  then continued from a new angle  
this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semicircle  with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends  
the motion cameras film the action  and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once  
place each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second  
pretty slick  
the matrix drips with style  
from the clothing to the music to the action  were watching an exaggerated version of what were used to  
much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film  theres a lot of kung fu  theres a lot of gunplay  
when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon  much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion  
theres also the element of the japanese action cartoon  called anime by aficionados   especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects  
combined  its really like no liveaction film i have ever seen  
the film is not without its faults  
some of the scenes and ideas are  borrowed  a little too liberally from other films  and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing  
some of the lines are also pretty bad  in one instance  a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying  and it wasnt meant to be a joke  
however  these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action scifi film that for once does more than merely entertain

0	"did i do something bad  
i must have  because sitting through this movie was sheer punishment  
heres the plot  
ricky  jeff goldblum  is producer of the goodbuy network  one of those 24hour home shopping channels  
the new boss  robert loggia  plans to can rickys behind if he doesnt turn the previous months flat sales numbers around  and to add to his problems  ricky also has to work with kate  kelly preston   the ivy league wunderkind whom the boss has brought with him  
kate and ricky dont get along and dont have any great ideas until they meet g  eddie murphy   a spiritualist who sees something positive in everything  
his soothing voice and simple logic makes people feel good  and its this quality that will make g the new gbn television star and the key to the networks success  
the first problem is a flaw in the plot  
sure  g makes people feel good  
sure  were told that most people feel guilty after buying an impulse item  no matter how wealthy they might be  and ill even believe that g talks a talk that allows people to feel good about what theyve bought  
but  hey  thats after theyve bought it  
why do sales skyrocket the first time g is on camera  
far from trying to sell the product  g instead blathers on about how you dont even need the thing  
someone please tell me how this is supposed to move merchandise in the first place  
you might say that people feel good about what theyve bought  so they come back and by more  but due to the simple fact that the first round of sales in inexplicable  im not convinced this is what the filmmakers had in mind  
the whole movie is therefore seriously undermined because the key point in the plot is never credible  
another problem is in the humor  
you know  if you see that eddie murphy is in a movie  i think it is not unreasonable for you to expect that the film is a comedy  
whoa  partner  are you in for a surprise  
holy man is not funny  
murphy  the one asset youd think this movie has  remember how they brought him in at the last minute to save best defense  
 then again  maybe you dont  is seriously reigned in  
the script gives him almost nothing to work with  and it seems as though director stephen herek kept him toned down so that the other actors in the film wouldnt be left as window dressing  
theres only one moment in the film where murphy is allowed to let loose  and it lasts for three shouted words  which seem totally out of place as a result  
pathetic  
in all  there are about three jokes that work in the entire picture  and theyre not even that great  
as a side note  there are some cameo appearances such as dan marino pitching a contraption which allows you to cook off of your car engine  and james brown introducing a medicalert device that shouts  help me   
just like the hardest working man in show business at the push of a button  but these never cause your personal laughometer to rise above the level of mild bemusement  
  well   you ask   surely there must be some convincing performances to make up for the lack of humor   
think again  buckwheat  
jeff goldblum disappoints  
kelly preston is flat  but not like that   
robert loggia  in the kind of role for which he has been virtually typecast  cant do anything with it  
the script is part of the problem  but these actors dont even look like they believe in the move theyre making  
they look a lot like theyre bored  
just like the audience  
so what do you have when the humor is absent from your comedy  and the acting is like the siberian steppes  
a film that drags more than a dropped anchor  
but wait  
as if these problems dont make the film slow enough  the screenplays pacing makes the movie even slower  
it takes the entire first half hour to establish the movies premise  then more time as the film wades through a tortuous  and seemingly mandatory  romance between ricky and kate  and a subplot involving a conniving pr man  eric mccormack  who wants to discredit g and take over rickys job as producer  
when the pr guys plan is foiled  the film is climaxes  were treated to that little epilogue  and then we can all go home  right  
wrong  
the movie goes on for another half hour  
continental drift is the indy 500 compared to the pace of holy man  
the only thing holy about holy man will surely be the number of people exclaiming  holy   that movie was awful   
this one is for the truly pious

0	"synopsis  valerie  a high school junior who doesnt look a day under 22  writes bad poetry  complains about how much she hates school  fantasizes about a young guy on trial for raping and murdering six women  chooses him as a pen pal  and plays hooky to see him in court  
after a jailbreak  the killer puts on big sunglasses  wears a halfbuttoned jacket  and uses his fatal charm to go after valerie  
comments   alan smithee  directed fatal charm  which should have been more appropriately titled  fatal bore  or  fatal crap   
if you find out that a film youre about to see is directed by  alan smithee   then you should seriously  seriously  seriously consider watching something  anything  else  
  alan smithee  is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad  
frankly  id be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey  so i think i understand why the director might have picked the  alan smithee  moniker for this film  
where to begin with this painfully poor thriller  
lets start with the acting  
its pretty bad  
amanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent  the rest of the cast dont   even though her performance isnt exactly stellar material  
shes also miscast  she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete  
her scenes with valeries mother  played by mary frann  are a joke  
the two look as though theyre a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together  rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesnt understand  
christopher atkins  a handsome enough actor who plays the killer  adam  looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm  
trying to appear malicious and dangerous  he wears large sunglasses and a halfbuttoned jacket  
if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber  atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead  but he doesnt cut it here  
early on in the movie  a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom  
outside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers  the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film  
they constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever  
fatal charms storyline  such as it is  inspires more yawns than thrills  
the script belabors a red herring  early on  about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam  atkins  is charged with  
this suspect  however  turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film  an obvious plot fault  
even for the idiots who didnt consider the movies title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed  it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up  
so  the audience must wait  if they havent already stopped watching  as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawnout finale  
the video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an  erotic thriller   
a thriller it isnt  and neither is it particularly erotic  
i cant imagine  if someone were in the mood for something  erotic   that hed be happy after watching this fluff  
a few erotic moments occur in the film  they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus  see  theyre supposed to be valeries fantasies  how creative   
on a personal note  i was disturbed by the ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through  
its no wonder why she hated high school so much  
as an instructor of english myself  i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature  a teacher would stoop to reading a students bad poetry  of course  its valeries  about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poems inspiration  
i guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students  
fatal charm wont charm anyone  unless theres someone thats charmed by boring  lifeless  insipid  suspenseless thrillers  
if you happen upon this turkey  just keep moving on

0	"synopsis  al simmons  topnotch assasin with a guilty conscience  dies in a fiery explosion and goes to hell  
making a pact with malebolgia  a chief demon there  simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn  a general in hells army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives  chains  and a morphing cape  
sullen  wise cogliostro and flatulating  wisecracking violator vy for spawns attention  
comments  when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics  where he had made a name for himself as a firstrate comic book penciller on the  spiderman  titles  to join the newlyformed  creatorowned image comics  a new comic book legend was born  spawn  
mcfarlanes  spawn  immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s  
mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate  allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max  
the early  spawn  issues brilliantly capture mcfarlanes genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing  
with the popularity of  spawn  and the success of the current warner bros  s batman film franchise  a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn  
in the summer of 1997  hence  new line cinema released spawn  a liveaction film based on the groundbreaking series  
this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book  like me  numbed by how much spawn misses the mark  
what happened  
why is spawn so bad  
todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo  
i dont think  however  that his presence necessarily hurt  or helped  the film  
i place the blame  in part  on the recent hollywood trend  fueled by public demand apparently  for special effects blowout movies utilizing the latest computer technology  
these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else  character  plot  dialogue  etc  spawn  reflecting this trend  shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics  
hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires  explosions  knives and chains appearing out of nowhere  glowing eyes  or constantly transforming demons  
a lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid  dont get me wrong  but  because the script and cast arent engaging  spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper  the surface may capture the eye  but nothing exists underneath   
spawns translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level  
mcfarlanes spawn was a tortured hero  
a mercenary by trade  al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda  
having died and journeyed to hell  he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda  
simmons  however  discovers that his memories are fragmented  his body a creepy mess  and his wife married  
despite his sometimes violent nature  readers couldnt help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld  
spawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so  
when the characters are developed  they seem absurd rather than touching  
the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot  a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world  do not help matters  
spawn  in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman  also unwisely spends too much time on a villain  the violator  batman favored the joker over batman   
john leguizamo  like jack nicholson in batman  receives top billing in the cast as the violator  michael jai white  al simmons  spawn  is second  
i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator  
the film  however  spends so much time on the violators offensive antics that they grate on the nerves  
apparently meant to be the comic relief in the film  as nicholson was in batman   especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn  the violators lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny  leaving the audience wishing he would leave  
leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role  but he is seen far too often in the film  
michael jai white  a relative newcomer to theatrical releases  seems to be an appealing actor  and he handles his role adequately  but we see little of him without various masks on  
more time needed to be spent on whites character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings  
a special note should be made about martin sheen as the overthetop  obnoxious  evil general wynn  
easily the hammiest performance in the movie  its hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much  after all  he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now  
sheens excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film  
many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down  
mtvstyle  jerky  inyourface editing is one of them  
flames  for example  roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting  
cogliostro  unlikely wannabe guide for spawn  serves as a poor narrator for the film  
he goofily tells the audience  at one point  that  how much of spawns humanity is left remains to be seen   as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another  
the music  finally  assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue  
loud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes  
to be fair  however  marilyn mansons  long hard road out of hell  effectively compliments spawns return to earth  while filter and the crystal methods   cant you  trip like i do  proves a surprisingly fitting theme song  
for as good a comic book as it is   spawn  did not spawn a good movie  
spawn  instead  suffers from too much pomp and circumstance  and too little plot and character development  
it receives two stars for its technically welldone special effects  
many other films  though  have equal  if not superior  special effects and are much better  
rated pg13  spawn seems more violent than many rrated movies and probably wouldnt be appropriate for the very young  
"
1	"few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parkers adaptation of frank mccourts memoir angelas ashes  
many dismissed it as an humorless  sentimentalized  uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel  others hailed it as a heartfelt  sincere portrait of the human spirit  
im somewhere in between  leaning strongly towards the latter  
its certainly wellmade and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be  
but i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudolyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the twoandahalf hour running time that screams  im important   
mccourts book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900s  a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us  
as he comments   we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty   
in ireland  frank  played by joe breen as a small child   his 3 brothers  his mother angela  emily watson  and his father malachy  robert carlyle  get financial help from angelas mother  a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman  
she helps them get a ratinfested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job  
positions are scarce and when he does finally find one  he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking  
meanwhile  frank goes to an uptight catholic school  where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires  
two of franks brothers soon die  crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition  
as if the poverty and the suffering werent intense enough as it stood  malachy and angela have another baby  worsening the situation further  
i imagine this doesnt sound like much of a plot  
thats probably because it isnt one  
these are people  
this is their story  
director alan parker  the commitments  knows how to tell a good story and angelas ashes  despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting  
though the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting  it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue  
supplementing parkers able direction are the engaging  often poignant performances of the leads  some of them seasoned thespians  others relative beginners  
carlyle  the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama  perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character  
we empathize with the guy  but we dont like or admire him  
emily watson turns in a heartfelt  sincere supporting performance  
it is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats  
also worthy of mention is little joe breen  whose face graces the films superb poster  
it is breens first feature film and hes extraordinary as young frank  
not unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense  you can peer into the characters soul through breens sad eyes  
on the flip side  one thing that could have vastly improved angelas ashes is a more decisive editor  
while gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery  he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage  
the first half  especially  could have been trimmed down  bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process  
things pick up at about the halfway point  sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour  but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co  set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary  
  spoiler warning  
skip next paragraph if in suspense   
the films final message is somewhat conflicted  as frankie  in effect  leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america  
what  exactly  are we supposed to make of that  
his mother doesnt seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son  as any mother would  but it still seems inconsiderate of him  
i havent read the book  but im sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein  therefore  im suspicious  
another thing thats never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title  which  im sure  is also explained in the memoir  
if seen as a film onto itself  rather than an adaptation  angelas ashes stands tall  
despite a few minor setbacks  it is a captivating story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the financial ladder  
"
1	"  dangerous beauty  is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583  
it is beautifully filmed  wonderfully acted  and certainly nothing short of entertaining  but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness  
dealing with themes of forbidden love  religious intolerance  subordination of women  sexual freedom  and the roles of pleasure and sin in a highcultured society  it still feels like brightly lit fluff  
the director  marshall herskovitz  doesnt want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down  so he opts for a more genial  livelier  and relatively shallow interpretation  
the film takes place during the renaissance  a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe  
at this time  venice was its own republic  and it thrived on being the central juncture of eastwest commerce  
the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice  so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived  
however  there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes  their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment  
the story centers on veronica franco  catherine mccormack   a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier  rufus sewell   the son of wealthy aristocratic parents  jeroen krabb  and joanna cassidy   
unfortunately  the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love  rather  it was more like a business transaction  where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power  wealth  and ensure that outsiders couldnt get in  
veronica  despite her charm and good looks  is certainly an outsider  
after a short love affair  marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her  
however  because she is beautiful and intelligent  veronica has a chance to enter marcos world  albeit not as his wife  
she decides to become a courtesan  a class of women who were as welleducated as they were ravishing  and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite  
a courtesan was not a mere prostitute  they were afforded a special place in society  and they were greatly revered  respected  and often envied  
at one point  a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants  
veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother  paola  jacqueline bisset   who was once a famed courtesan herself  
once she enters the lifestyle  veronica finds that it suits her quite well  
she is allowed to read all the books she wants  she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry  and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet  including the awestruck marco  
their relationship develops into a playful bantering  with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marcos advances  
in many ways  their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love  and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love  
  love the love  not the man   as her mother told her  
  dangerous beauty   which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal  flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice  
it has multiple plot lines  including veronicas adversarial relationship with a court poet  oliver platt   her role in obtaining frances military assistance in venices battle against the turks  and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition  yet it is never confusing or overbearing  
much of the films success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role  
known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibsons ire in  braveheart   1995   mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady  
she has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan  her character is intelligent  witty  and both sensual and vulnerable  all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes  
the rest of the roles are also filled well  including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in  dark city  have assured him a solid place in hollywood  
he has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta  and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas  
oliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin  although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy  
platt is a good actor  but hes just too hard to hate  
jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was  and even fred ward turns up in a small  but moving performance as marcos uncle  
  dangerous beauty  is marshall herskovitzs sophomore directorial effort  after the overlooked 1993 film  jack the bear   
partnered with edward zwick  herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television   thirtysomething    my socalled life   and in the movies   legends of the fall    
his directing style can be best described as transparent  it never gets in the way of the story  yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions  
he could have approached the film in any number of ways  including overdosing on the sexual aspect  which he wisely avoids  
  dangerous beauty  contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic  but not so much that it seems exploitative  
herskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew  including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli  whose previous efforts include the highlystylized thriller  kalifornia   1993  and abel ferraras dark scifi film  body snatchers   1994   
bazelli captures the film in strong  bold colors  and be brings sixteenthcentury venice to life in wide  panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery  
however  the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood   brazil    the princess bride   and the costumes by gabriella pescucci   the age of innocence    
the only problem with  dangerous beauty  is that it doesnt stick with you  
its a good story welltold with interesting characters  but its easy to shrug off once youve left the theater  
the only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions  but it never quite comes off because its simply too melodramatic and conventional  
herskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter  but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion  and like the rest of the film  it carries no real weight  despite the potential severity of the subject matter

0	"much ado about nothing  
ah  how sweet the irony  
its accepted wisdom in some circles  among english literature nuts  mainly  that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance  
he just doesnt  understand  shakespeare  you will hear them say  
the bards work is apparently beyond criticism  
what a load of old cobblers  
if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaughs film of shakespeares  comedy  much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word  its time to get a life  
get monty python  
get woody allen  
get john waters  
whatever  
just get a real taste of some clever  witty  risky comedy  
and banish this nonsense to where it belongs  
drama and tragedy was shakespeares strength  
to my sensibilities  and im no stick in the mud  much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever  
no kidding  this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in my 20 years of movie going  
the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend  as this was our day out and i hadnt seen her in ages  
but boy  does she owe me one  
i wont spend too much time on the plot  
basically  we follow the trials and tribulations of two wouldbe couples  one young  the other older  
theres some dark treachery amongst all this  but everyone is so awfully jolly that youd hardly know it  
mind you  theres nothing wrong with the basic story  
good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound  
nothing wrong with most of the cast  either  
branaugh  emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers  
the problem is the script  or more accurately  shakespeares original text  
light comedy shouldnt be complex  
yet wrapped in elizabethan english  the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend  
for this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than a good  undemanding laugh  
the only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves  the actor once again miscast as a jealous halfbrother or something  
but when dissected and understood  what it all boils down to is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame  
this is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold  
ho  ho  ho  boy likes girl  
ho  ho  ho  men are such klutzes  
ho  ho  ho  shes so awfully clumsy  
oh please  
theres wit in here somewhere  im told  
i call it pretentious  
something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay  
in the end  its cringeworthy  
watching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience  
comedy  
bah  humbug

then there are movies that spend the whole time posing questions and try to answer it all in the last five minutes  
writerdirector john herzfelds two days in the valley falls into the latter category  
weaving together a grabbag of seemingly unrelated characters  herzfelds tries very hard to keep the audience guessing with a altmanesque series of parallel stories  
hitmen lee  james spader  and his partner dosmo  danny aiello  pop a guy in bed while leaving his drugged wife becky fox  teri hatcher  lying next to him showing the audience where on her behind she got nicely pricked  
an understandeably shocked becky runs out of the house the next morning before hailing down a couple of vice cops   jeff daniels  and wes  eric stoltz   
a murder is not vice territory  flirting with asian prostitues is  but wes would rather play inquisitive detective  
meanwhile  washedup director  teddy  paul mazursky  is about to end his life  
but before he can do that  he must find a good home for his dog  
enter nurse audrey  marsha mason   who takes the dog and teddy for a ride  
stuffy art dealer  allan hopper  greg cruttwell  has kidney stones  
while struggling about his fancy house  he switches between moaning in selfpity and dropping condescending hints about his loyal secretarys  glenne headly  plain appearance  
dont be surprised if you find yourself asking more than once just what the hell is going on  
you might like that feeling of cluelessness  
herzfeld does answer all the questions in the course of time and pieces it all rather neatly in the last five minutes  
the jigsaw puzzle assembled isnt stunning by any means though  
the characters lack the stature or moral complexity of altmans reallife heroes in short cuts  even though they are interesting and funny  
funny  that is if you arent comparing them to the likes of tarantinos pulp chcaracters  
the tieup is tidy but nowhere near the squeaky clean resolution of  directors name  
guy who also did last seduction  red rock west  
two days isnt a bad movie but there isnt much else to it than the screenplay novelty of the linkage of seemingly unrelated characters  
itll keep you guessing alright but you wont remember the answers five minutes after the credits  
the flying inkpot rating system   wait for the tv2 broadcast  
   a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha  
    pretty good  bring a friend  
     amazing  potent stuff  
      perfection  
see it twice

1	"its terribly unfortunate that  stir of echoes   tautly written and directed by david koepp  who made one of 1996s unsung treasures   the trigger effect    should be released little more than a month after  the sixth sense   which is still going strong at the box office  
these two films are undoubtedly going to be compared  judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night   and although they have eerily similar storylines   stir of echoes  is more of a straightforward psychological horror film  while  the sixth sense  is closer to a psychological drama  
additionally  while  the sixth sense  had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business   stir of echoes  is more conventional and predictable in its final twist  
and where  the sixth sense  was disturbing   stir of echoes  is just plain scary  
i have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities  and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits  
adapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago   stir of echoes  opens with a cute sixyearold boy named jake  zachary david cope  who is taking a bath  
he is speaking directly at the screen  but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there  
finally  he asks   does it hurt to be dead   
apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people  but unlike  the sixth sense   this young child isnt the focus of the picture  
instead  tom witzy  kevin bacon   a chicago lineman  is our protagonist  
jake is his son  and maggie  kathryn erbe   whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant  is his hardworking wife  
one night while at a party with their closest friends  tom convinces maggies newage sister  lisa  illena douglas   to try and hypnotize him  
it unexpectedly works  and before long  tom is seeing things he wouldnt normally see  including a deceased teenage girl  jenny morrison  in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months  
seeking help from lisa  she tells him that  while he was under hypnosis  she told him that after he awoke  his mind will remain clear and free  like an opened door  
she didnt expect it to work  but it did  and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees  
  stir of echoes  isnt a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination  but in the thick  atmospheric mood it conjures up  it is a terrifically eerie domestic horrordrama  and is not only effective on a technical level  but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling workingclass family  
kevin bacon and  especially  kathryn erbe  1997s  dream with the fishes    are topnotch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems  
after tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions  he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house  and instead of maggie not being understanding  she instead believes what tom says  and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through  does not try to stop his pursuit  
bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts  and therefore  are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet  
in a masterfullydone  entrancing sequence  tom is hypnotized by lisa  but instead of watching him  we instead see what he sees  starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness  
lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater  and so  we  as audience members  are watching a movie screen from inside a theater  which is also showing a movie screen in a theater  
telling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen  we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is  sleep   
never before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantlyconstrued as this one  
truthfully  this setpiece  and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt  are worth the full price of admission alone  just to see them on the big screen  
having loads of fun with her small role as maggies sister  lisa  illeana douglas  1995s  to die for   her last great character  is a delight  but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films  
funny and enjoyably offbeat  douglas gets to utter the best line in the film  while talking to maggie about toms visions of the girl  she remarks   i wouldnt be worried about him seeing another girl  although the fact that shes dead gives one pause   
also of note are jenny morrison  1994s  intersection    who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character  and liza weil  remarkable in 1998s  whatever   as morrisons grieving teenage sister  debbie  
if the resolution of  stir of echoes  does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential  and it doesnt   what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty  
the music score  by james newton howard  and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects  successfully compliment and foreshadow the offkilter frameofmind that tom is put into  and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realisticallywritten characters  
  stir of echoes  isnt as good as  the sixth sense   but why should it need to be  
both films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet  and  stir of echoes  really is a spinetinglingly good horror film

0	"part buddy comedy  part fishoutofwater story  part nature tale  meet the deedles is not nearly as interesting as any of those archetypes  
in fact  it is an invitation you ought to disregard  
phil and stew deedle  paul walker and steve van wormer  are the twin sons of the famous millionaire  elton deedle  eric braeden   founder of deedle enterprises  
elton wants his sons to be the perfect heirs to his fortune    instead 
the two are careless hawaiian surf bums  
to set them straight  he enrolls them into a strict wyoming boot camp  to which the pair inevitably go  
after several misadventures in wyoming  where the duo is stunned to discover theres no surf  the brothers deedle stumble upon a routine mistaken identity plot  
they arrive at yellowstone national park  where they are believed to be two new park ranger recruits  
rather than slinking back home and disappointing their dad  the deedles play along  
phil  actually  has other motives  the beautiful park ranger jesse  a  
j  langer   who unfortunately happens to be the beloved stepdaughter of the overprotective park ranger captain douglas pine  john ashton   
yellowstone has a problem  
its only a week before the famous geyser old faithful celebrates its one billionth birthday  and the park is being overrun with prairie dogs  
not just one or two    thousands of them  
the deedles are assigned to eliminate the p  dog menace  not knowing that it all is part of a fiendish plan by disgraced former head ranger frank slater  dennis hopper   
the brothers deedle arent supposed to be outandout stupid  like the team from dumb and dumber  or bill and ted  
instead  their brains just operate in a different  simpler  realm  
a more accurate comparison would be with carrot top in chairman of the board  a film which  unfortunately  this one resembles in several hideous ways  
the central problem with meet the deedles is that it simply just isnt funny  
theres a moment when phil utters the line   insert laugh here   which nearly sums up the entire meet the deedles experience  
the result isnt bad in a runshriekingfromthetheater type of way  
instead  its merely bad in an excruciatingly boring sort of way  
the cast seems decent  but theyre never asked to do anything remotely interesting  
instead  the film inundates the audience with countless shots of people andor cars rolling downhill in the forest  and with constant annoying references to other disney films  
youll have much better luck finding a good spot to surf in wyoming than finding entertainment in meet the deedles

0	"mr  bean  a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting  
the first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during beans trip to la  but if they didnt look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride  
heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick  
either way look out america bean is coming  
well  what can really be said about this movie  there is very little discernible plot  
that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy  
it achieves that goal rather admirably  but because it is that  the plot is just screaming for help  
the whole premise that the movie is based on is to say the least flawed  
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes adlibbed as you went  
dont go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece  
but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie  even if you dont like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because somethings are just so stupid  
the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims  or so it seems  
now when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things  first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner  
well  there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasnt the easiest i am sure  
i have to concede that mr  atkinsons acting in this movie is well done  
although the role isnt too demanding the slapstick is  
i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue  it would have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie  
now the rest of the actors in the movie  bad acting and poor casting  
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better  just seemed wrong for the movie  
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasnt what was trying to be achieved  
one thing that i must say  simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results  
tv shows should do just that stay on tv  it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers  
i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively  the best known of those would have to be star trek  
bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved  
now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly  
the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people  these people will think like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless  
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie  
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie  
there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one

0	"five years after his directorial debut based on stephen kings writings called the shawshank redemption  910   writerdirector frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king  
unlike the latter film  this one is a big  long  laborious bore  
plot  a sevenfoot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers  
critique  this film is slow  drawnout  boring  uninteresting  unexciting  predictable and topped with a couple of onedimensional  evil  characters  
its only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles  
the real miracle of my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward  unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about  
of course  much like all other death row cell blocks  this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be  misunderstood   except for one cookiecutter crazy guy who is evil personified  
and lets not forget all the guards on death row  who also happen to be angels from the heaven above  except for one cookiecutter crazy guard who is also evil personified  and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates      
am i supposed to identify with anyone in this film  
or even more importantly  am i supposed to give a rats ass about anyone in this film  
well  if i was  i sure missed that boat  because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin  
furthermore  there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyones life to present this story  
in fact  the story is empty within itself  
i truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal  and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not  
wow  
how interesting  
the plots utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film  we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie   
whip out those thinking caps  kids  
hmmm  and i wonder what will happen to those two cookiecutter  evil  guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity  
hmmmm  now think hard here  boys and girls  
what a crock  
i am guessing that this film was supposed to be some threehour exercise in spirituality  but unfortunately for me  it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging  
in fact  it was one big bore  
i didnt see the point of the movie  i didnt see the point of the story and i certainly didnt see the point in tom hanks big doublechin  
all in all  a bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work  especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour  john coffey  
give that man an award or something

0	"actually  im fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie  
  baywatch  babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her doubleds on the small screen  
at least there you dont have to pay to see her cleavage  
and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless  hate to burst your bubble  but there are no fullfledged nude scenes in barb wire  
you wouldnt be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in  
i cant go back in time and reverse my mistake  but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there  
they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude  its so quick you cant even tell for sure whether youre seeing her andersons or not  
a nipple hallucination sort of thing  
barb wire was adapted from a comic book  interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life  even wearing lowcut leather to do office work  businesswoman bondage wear  and having unreal body proportions  
yes  like the mona lisa  pamela anderson is a manmade beauty  probably in more senses than one  
she is a definite beauty  though  and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience  
youd just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldnt have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie  because its obvious she wasnt pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills  
i mean  she shows off more cleavage here than a jewelers convention  
the movie is set in the year 2017   the worst year of my life   pam says  
   the worst movie of the year   i say   
america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation  silicone valley  i think   
she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right  posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute  
but dont call her  babe   
she hates that  and reminds us of that fact way too many times  
imagine  a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist  demeaning term  
a liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldnt have to hear words like  babe  during a strip tease  especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success  
the plot  haha  revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorates retina scanners  
in the words of one of the characters  theyre  more than meets the eye   
reminds me of the  transformers  cartoon  and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent  but that never happened  
no  the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela vandamme  bigbusted kickboxer  and her resistance accomplices  exboyfriend axel  tamuera morrison  and cora  victoria rowell   
thank god they didnt name her cora reef  
one bad character name is more than enough  
pamela originally doesnt take sides  giving some speech about shes only loyal to the money they pay her  but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother  jack noseworthy of bon jovi  always  video fame  
i still dont know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy  but he definitely is nose worthy  even if he isnt sponge worthy   
pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semiautomatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest  
its not rambo    
its bimbo  
mark my words  barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year  
its got all the elements of the directtovideo releases featured on hbos bastard cousin  the cable channel id never watch if it didnt somehow come free  
its got the nontitillating scenes of voyeurism  laughable flashbacks  bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo  
theres even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movies premise while the words scroll up the screen  
someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this aint star wars  
if youve seen any action flick of the past fifteen years  youll recognize plenty of lifted elements  
barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over  car crashes  explosions  broken glass and slowmotion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death  
this is one of those automaticpilot movies anyone could write or direct  
barb wire has only two things going for it    
and i think you know what those two things are

1	"its a curious thing  ive found that when willis is not called on to carry the whole movie  hes much better and so is the movie  
even though  in the sixth sense he is the  name   he doesnt have the pivotal role  
that honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear  cute pun  seer  a 9 year old boy who can see ghosts  
if osment was cute or precious  the director going for the maudlin  this would be nothing more than a movieoftheweek  thankfully  osment is not only better than that  but in some instances  blows everyone else off the screen in a bravura performance  
we get to see his fears  vulnerabilities  strengths and intelligence which makes the sixth sense one of the best movies ive seen this year  
the whole cast matches him in quality  with willis giving a fairly low key performance that matches the subject matter  
one thing about this movie  its target  
this isnt a sfxfest like the haunting or a gorefest  this is more what id call a supernatural drama  more interested in characters than in dazzling you with makeup  
one caveat  theres a lovely twist in the movie  something like the usual suspects  where you end up replaying the movie in your head rethinking what you have just seen  
i was extremely lucky to see it as a sneak preview in toronto  before any hype or critical reviews were out  so i went in with no biases  
if anyone want to talk to about the movie before you see it  dont let them  
let the director explain on his own pace and youll enjoy the movie vastly more

  more people die on fishing boats  per capita  than working in any other job in the u  s   
every journey a fishing boat makes can be an allornothing risk

and thats just what he captures in this true story of struggle and humanity aboard a swordfishing boat  the andrea gail  sailing out of gloucester  massachusetts  in late october  1991  
early in bill wittliffs screenplay  based on sebastian jungers bestseller  we meet the crew of six

his righthand man  mark walhberg  needs money to build a new life with his girlfriend  diane lane   
theres a devoted dad  john c  reilly  with an estranged wife and son  a freespirited jamaican  allen payne   a lonely guy  john hawkes   and a lastminute replacement with a bad attitude  william fichtner

theres a rogue wave  a man overboard and the ice machine breaks  with 60  000 lb  
of fish that could spoil  
but thats minor compared with a deadly monster storm approaching which a boston meteorologist describes as  a disaster of epic proportions  that also threatens the lives of a coast guard helicopter rescue team trying to save three people stranded on a sailboat on the high seas  
its formulaic and there are cliches  but the walls of water  created by fluid dynamics simulating reallife phenomena  are awesome  
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10   the perfect storm  is a terrifying  suspenseful 8  
hang on for the whiteknuckle thrill ride of the summer  
"
1	"i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years  
it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood  
but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years  i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex  
yes  more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me  trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster  
for all teenagers  its almost like a rite of passage  
and what we did was sometimes downright nasty  sometimes funny  and sometimes shocking  
and all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer  
american pie is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year  
just how great are their hormones raging  
one of them notes  after watching disneys the little mermaid  that ariel is soooo hot  
the four schoolmates are kevin  oz  finch and jim  
kevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend  but doesnt want to have sex until the time is just right  
but what is the perfect time  
there is just no way to know  and that frightens him  
oz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive  
he joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages  
finch is the phobic hermit who doesnt stand a chance with any girl  
so  he pays someone 200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess  
suddenly  girls are lining up to go out with him  
but among these friends  it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful  
when he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student  his inexperience comes shining through  
he has much to learn  and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge  
this may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with moms apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking  raunchy  yet unbelievably funny  
the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its r rating  
there is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that theres something about mary was gloriously ribald  
in fact  at first this film received a sinful nc17 rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teenaccessible rating  
but i guess after seeing the noholdsbarred coarseness of south park  this seems tame by comparison  
teens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest  
but unlike many teen sex comedies  there is a genuine intelligence at work here  
these are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex  
their plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences  
they know what they want  yet temper it with responsibility  
but almost always  its impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster  and its these episodes that make american pie such a carnal delight to watch

0	"its not a bad thing to update old stories  
its done all the time in the oral tradition  
the difficulty with this film is not that the tale has changed  its that its dry  
the new cinderella  danielle  drew barrymore  is not sitting around waiting for her prince to come  
shes a woman of the late twentieth century albeit situated in sixteenth century france  
when her father dies  she stays on in his house even though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla  anjelica huston   
she works by day  but reads sir thomas more by firelight at night  
although the story is updated  you know the plot  
danielle meets prince henry  dougray scott   goes to a ball disguised  is later found out and they live happily ever after  
the movie is often like watching a filmed play  
theater in real life is engrossing  
theater on the screen is usually lifeless  
there doesnt seem to be much going on  
the camera can be a star of films  
here its a coconspirator  
danielles convictions are compromised  
a socialist and a feminist  she pretends to be royalty to get her man  
a kind woman  her last act in the movie is one of revenge  
the most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish  
the fairy godmother standin  leonardo da vinci  patrick godfrey  is fun to watch as the eccentric old man who advises danielle  
huston is enjoyable in her overthetop wickedness  
in all fairness  my companion loved the film  
maybe its one of those  chick flicks  that men dont like  
it is certainly a date film  
nearly the entire audience was couples  
oh well  maybe its good for something

0	"its amazing how a comedian can have the some of the funniest standup around but completely fall flat in the movies  
take adam sandler  
on the basis of his first two cds   theyre all gonna laugh at you   
and  what the hell happened to me     
hes the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams  
but when you put him in front of a camera  it just isnt the same  
i kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted a marginal recommendation  but his latest film  the waterboy is about as funny as a root canal  
seriously  im willing to wager than there were more laughs in saving private ryan than there are here  
in fact  i found this movie to be more depressing than comedic  
the first half hour generated not one smile in me  with its scenes of emotional abuse towards adams character of bobby boucher not only by the cruel football players  but also by his very disturbed mother  kathy bates  what is the world coming to    
granted  after the film gets rolling  there are a few mild chuckles throughout  im even willing to admit that it actually had me laughing once or twice   but not nearly enough to sustain the waterboy for its nearly hour and a half running time  
youre all familiar with the plot because youve seen it at least a million times before  everyone picks on the hero until he shows a hidden talent and leads the underdog team to victory over the champions  in the process not only winning the respect of his teammates but also getting the woman he loves  
and believe me  im not giving anything away by saying that sandlers team wins  
if you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie  then god be with you  
the only things that keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as the insecure coach and the severely underrated fairuza balk as bobbys love interest  
i mean  they should be lending their talents to some loftier purpose  but they do extremely well with what they are given here  
kudos to both of them  
my advice to adam is to try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin  who made a very smooth and successful transition from stage to screen  
rely more on actual comedy rather than strange voices and rude noises to make people laugh  
or maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have  like jim carrey did with the recent truman show  
with the obvious and considerable talent that he possesses  he just cant keep going on like this  
"
1	"  last night  could have an  aka  tagged on the end of it that says   its the end of the world  and we feel fine   
  last night  is about just that  
the last night of planet earths existence  
the world is going to end at precisely midnight  january 1st  2000  
how scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained  
nor is the event itself  
throughout the entire movie  no explanation is given as to why this is happening  
in doing this  mckellar  who also wrote and directed the film  seems to be trying to transcend the genre  
hes attempted to make a film about people  and how each of them deals with their last night of life  
the film contains no science fiction elements  which allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings and actions of the characters  
mckellar is largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material  
the film is set in toronto  and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence  
theres mckellar  who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs  but keeps getting interrupted by a woman  sandra oh  in search of her husband  
her husband  played by david cronenberg  is spending the day working at the gas company  informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end  
finally  theres mckellars friend  played by callum keith rennie  a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of  
mckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters ive seen in a film in months  
these people all felt real to me  especially the character played by sandra oh  
we can see her desperation  her utter need to be with her husband in the final hours  
rennie is good  too  as the man who wants to literally try everything before he dies  
he exudes such charm and likeablity  its not surprising that were rooting for him to get what he wants  
but for me  the biggest surprise in the movie is mckellar  
i knew that he was a talented director  but i had no idea he could act as well  
his insistence to be alone  much to the dismay of his parents  is something that most people would find difficult to understand  but as played by mckellar  we can understand his reasons  
he doesnt buy into the whole notion that just because everyones going to die  he should immediately find some companionship  
he realizes the relationship would be forced  and they would only be together for the sake of being together  
mckellar gives a brilliant performance  and i hope he alternates between directing and acting  
my only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending  
i really wanted to know  and my need to know was hanging over the film at all times  
i appreciate the fact that mckellar didnt want the material to rule the film  and that he wanted the movie to be more of a study in human behavious  
however  in not telling the audience what the cause of earths destruction is  hes left a big question that is in their minds throughout the film  
another problem is we never see anybody panicking  
i would imagine if the world was ending  and there was nothing to be done about it  a large segment of the population would be going out of their minds  
instead  we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like its new years eve  
i just didnt buy the fact that everyone had completely accepted their fate  
no one had the urge to  rage against the dying of the light   
despite these small problems   last night  is one of the best movies of the year  
as opposed to the moronic  armageddon    last night  treats the subject at hand with maturity and believabilty  
and bruce willis never shows up to save the day  
"
0	"plot summary  the year is 2024  
the ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation by a shield invented by connor mccleod  
the shield  although saving lives  has made the atmosphere hot and humid  
connor is a mortal and a tired old man who has given up hope  
on returning from the opera one night connor is accosted by the leader of a  terrorist  organisation  
they have tried to find out what the company that now runs the shield unit are covering up  
connor is then attacked by two assassins sent by katana from the planet zeist  like zeitget it    
they fail and connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off  
he then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland  
both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment  
connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield  
katana meanwhile  fearing connor would return  sets out himself to kill the highlander  
if you have never seen it  
being a fan of highlander and mr  connery  i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii  the quickening  
i wish it had been quicker  
i feel whatever else you can say about a film  bad script bad music  etc   if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said  
the film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so  the time mr  connery is on the screen for  is worth watching  
the plot sounds a little ridiculous but i was willing to give it a chance  
maybe they could pull it off  
instead  i find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film  
its as if they are different people with the same names  
witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance  where is the attitude of  who wants to live forever  when love must die  gone to  
the love subplot  must  have had footage cut out  
the highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before  
putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying  
i still want to know why connors coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal  
we are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it  nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill  
why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck  
i know the head needs to come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first  
to be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the worlds worst shot  
meanwhile connor develops lukeskywalkerlike powers of laser beam deflection  
as for  bad guys   we see a rebellion on zeist  crushed easier than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist  
two assassins are sent  presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no problems  
no more assassins are sent  
katana  supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill connor  
has he no more assassins  
has he no better  
why was the rebellion crushed so easily then  
michael ironside is totally unconvincing  bring back the kurgan   
he seems like a cartoon character and really isnt that evil  just stupid and violent  
we see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents  
yet he still seems like no threat  perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor  or maybe because his two best assassins wouldnt have been amiss with larry  curly and mo  
so much for plot and characters  
the music is atrocious  
it is at best intrusive and at worst annoying  
bring back queen  
there was an audible sigh  of relief   
when connor played a queen track in a juke box  
i believe this at least is to be corrected for the american release  
the acting is at best flat  except for mr  connery  
lambert is uninteresting and when he delivered  there can be only one  this time around it just made me wish there had only been one  highlander  
michael ironside is unconvincing  sorry  michael  i usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable  
so why 210  
visually the film is interesting at all times  
it has a blade runner feel to it and some of the special effects are quite stunning  
add to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles throughout the whole film  or is he smirking to himself  
his lines and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not been so obvious that he cannot take the whole thing seriously at all but hey   id  have done it for 12 million  
oh  and i agree with a previous reviewer  she  does  look like sharon stone but i believe it is her first film  
incidentally there is a line producer credited and i hear rumours of highlander iii  the wizard

0	"deadbang  an action thriller starring don johnson  lives up to its dumb title  or at least to half of it  
although deadbang is definitely dead  it is anything but a bang  in fact  they should have called this one  dead bore   
in the film  johnson plays    
you guessed it    
a cop  
the role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character  jerry beck  is a gritty los angeles homicide detective  a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on  miami vice   
a la mel gibson in lethal weapon  beck is an emotional wreck  complete with violent outbursts  unscrupulous police methods  and a bleak outlook on life  
becks wife has just divorced him  and she is cutting him off from their children  
she will not even allow him to wish them  merry christmas  by telephone  
but becks family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in deadbang  
beck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop  
his investigation starts in l  a  and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma  where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp  
virtually every aspect of deadbang is inept and ineffective  
the plot is incoherent and full of holes  
the movie depicts becks investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions  
the action sequences in deadbang are strictly thirdrate  and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense  
i certainly expected more from longtime director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller  the manchurian candidateas well as black sunday  seven days in may  and the french connection ii  
in all fairness to frankenheimer  however  i should note that most of deadbangs shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction  
deadbang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy  but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting  
according to the movies production notes  deadbang is based on the reallife experiences of stillactive detective jerry beck  
you would never guess this from watching deadbang  however  since the film totally lacks credibility  it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable  
most of the characters in deadbang are either atrociously acted  underdeveloped  superfluous  or all of the above  
william forsythe  for example  is painfully bad as arthur kressler  a wholesome bythebook fbi agent whos offended by becks foul language and unorthodox methods  
forsythes lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable  
deadbang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid   wkrp in cincinnati  and  franks place    but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role  he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains  
the sole function of penelope ann millers character is to give deadbang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less  
i guess the films title refers to this love scene since its definitely a dead bang  
the only real virtue of deadbang  believe it or not  is don johnson  who tries to overcome the limitations of the movies pitiful script  
johnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth  and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life  
and i must admit that deadbang does have one or two amusing moments  
the funniest scene has johnson throwingup all over a criminal as he interrogates him  
but when barf is the highlight of a movie  you know the movies in trouble  
the other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck  in which he cant keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen  
but two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make  
"
0	"the summer of 00 wasnt a very good one for devout cinephiles  
it offered no blair witches or sixth senses  the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient xmen adaptation and a flawed but entertaining shaft update  
nurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season  that batterycharging  at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o shit that moseys into multiplexes  time of year when all those oscar contenders  read   quality  films  compete for audiences  
alas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season  
its also indie director neil labutes first attempt at something resembling a mainstream picture  and im sad to report its a resounding failure  at least on this web site   a mess thats as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused labutes previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic  
i went in expecting something decent  for betty was gleefully praised  its screenplay even winning an award at cannes  but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment  
are critics so desperate for something unique that theyre blind to how derivative the particular brand of  uniqueness  betty dolls out is  
for the first time labute is working from a script he has not written  and he seems unsure of how to handle the material  
betty tries to be hip like pulp fiction  this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men   enchanting like the wizard of oz  of which this film makes several allusions to  and heartwarming like stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie  but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation  
its labutes half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he doesnt even seem to have half that heart in it  
nurse betty concerns a soap opera addict  betty  brilliantly played by renee zellweger   who witnesses the killing of her husband  del  aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife  by two hit men  morgan freeman and chris rock   
she happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities  
shes blocked out her husbands death and thinks shes a character in her favorite soap  a reason to love  
betty sets out on the road to la  with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk  searching for her soap boyfriend dr  david ravell  greg kinnear  while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit  
the labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men  slipped a bit  but not much  with his sophomore effort  your friends and neighbors  then fell straight on his ass with bash  a play he penned that was recently aired on showtime  
the play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist  only labutes persistence in wallowing in the horrid things  average  people do to each other  usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are  
in the play  paul rudd  as an obnoxious jock  delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death  while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim  boys will be boys   
another character  schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby  
what was once so powerful about labutes work  the casual  nonchalant cruelty and selfishness  often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree  had become so over the top it was borderline comic  
obviously  at this point  labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further  but nurse betty isnt it  
he clearly has little passion for what hes doing here  instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks  one of the hit men is a huge soap fan  and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadnt managed to transcend that  tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience  
nearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down  as the two are made to enact softboiled tarantinoesque dialogue  
they evince little chemistry  with rock constantly in over the top rant mode  acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man  an occupation thats represented far too frequently in movies nowadays   
i think rock is a great comic yet he hasnt been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies  whenever he acts  and no matter the part  its like hes doing the damn chris rock show  
surprisingly  at least considering her work in me  myself and irene  renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance  building on her baby faced  apple pie looks  
that wideopen face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirtyyearold body  
its the best work shes ever done  
freeman is effective as always  though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it  
the actor plays the role in his usual calm  collected manner  though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and bettys  suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality  
thats interesting but the movie doesnt do anything with it other than crash land the subtheme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle  
the film has good moments  many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear  especially his confrontation with zellweger   an almost soothing  lyrical score  and you know a movies in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it  but nothing jells  its parts  good or bad  are so disparate as to be opposing  
the film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film  a mainstream  female forrest gump or an oddball art film  but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke  
bettys screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence  without which betty wouldnt make any progress in the film  
nurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter  like how betty becomes a nurse in the film  a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover  she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victims wound because she happened to see how on tv  which leads to her being offered a room with the victims girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear    a little too tidy  dontcha think  
betty has an interesting theme  though it doesnt even seem aware of this  
the current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother  with more on the way  
this is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality  ironically reallife survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light   
instead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze  since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television  albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the 80s than the 00s   the film simply uses bettys delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b  no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation  
"
0	"1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood  two movies dealing with the same subject  or  to be precise  same  high concept   
in summer 1994  that  high concept  was  mad bomber action thriller   
in few weeks   thrillride of the summer  actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away  so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes  
the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland  where gaerity  tommy lee jones   ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material  escapes from prison  
he comes to boston  where he accidentally notices jimmy dove  jeff bridges   dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police  
few people except gaerity know the doves violent past  when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence  betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose  
gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror  directed specifically at doves colleagues  friends and relatives  
dove  who is just going to retire and start family  now must confront the mad bomber  
while speed doesnt even try to bother with plot and characters  using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes  blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story  
and that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed  
badly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all  
screenplay by john bateer and john rice  barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland  using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama  
the plot is  of course  full of implausibilities  
the main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual  no matter how brilliant he is  can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay  
those questions  same as in the case of speed  could be forgotten while the action goes on  but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters  
because of them  movie seems a little bit too long  and boring at times  
the most annoying element of the film  however  is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber  
his acting is so overthetop that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself  
this role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive  
the film have few bright points  though  
some of the action scenes are fine  which should be credited to director stephen hopkins  predator ii  judgement night   
and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of doves colleague  
but  all in all  blown away is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous  yet hardly unforgettable competitor

0	"the classic story  the production which ruined it 
marking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h  g  wells classic  new line cinema  armed with a stellar cast and expert makeup effects man stan winston  alien  predator  terminator etc  churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel  
of course  the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies  one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977  under the title the island of lost souls  sounds like a much better title     
the story begins with edward douglas  thewlis   a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific  who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery  kilmer  after his plane crashes into the sea  
douglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr  moreau  who incidently  owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize  
his hosts reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreaus lab  when a monstrous birth was in progress  
even worse  the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal  people   
douglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beastpeople community  which considers dr  moreau their maker  
using shocktherapy and the law  dr  moreau has long been able to keep his beastpeople civilised to some extent but there are a few animalmen who are just too savage to be controlled  
the island of dr  
moreau questions the ability of men playing god  
dr  moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free from hate and violence    but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long  
moreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp  
even so  the production has failed to make the most out of it  
there are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is  the characters are not  prioritized  so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important  before they know it  he or she or it perishes     rather 
ungloriously at times too  
perhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people  especially aissa  balk   the most human of moreaus creations  
the two very important characters  montgomery and dr  moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably  
more screen time could have been used for character interaction and development  
i really would have liked it better if  say  they delved more into dr  moreaus obsession  montgomerys purpose in the story and justification to as why the beastpeople had to rebel  
maybe the nature of the screenplay  which incidently  does not incorporate much action sequences in the film  forced the filmmakers to  cut a long story short  and make it more of an action film than anything else  its still summer  and movies have to be  marketable    
the special effects too  are really nothing for anyone to shout about  
at most  i would say the beastmen looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes  
this h  g  wells classic really has potential to be a good film  
unfortunately  after 2 adaptations  they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message which makes up the entire essence of the story  
as a third outing  the island of dr  moreau 
accomplishes little and is nothing more than an inferior version of the planet of the apes  
the flying inkpot rating system   wait for the tv2 broadcast  
   a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha  
    pretty good  bring a friend  
     amazing  potent stuff  
      perfection  
see it twice

1	"synopsis  an attractive mute makeup artist  working on an ultracheesy slasher movie in moscow  witnesses the production of a brutal snuff film and is subsequently chased by really bad russians  
meanwhile  the artists sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her  
comments  mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it  
drawn by the clever artwork on the video box  i rented the film expecting a complete turkey  
mute witness  however  was original  offbeat  and wellmade  
its one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about  
ive subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit  and it may be seen  on occasion  on the independent film channel  
the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense  as billy  the quite believable mute heroine  sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film  
the rest of the film takes good advantage of billys vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures  
to throw a curveball into the fray  billys sister karen and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some genuinely funny scenes  
a disappointingly trite ending and occasional comic blunders are the only two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film  
look for alec guinness  obiwan kenobi from the first star wars trilogy  in a small role as the evil reaper  
definately check this movie out  although  as a word of warning  it does contain several scenes of rather grisly violence which certainly arent for the squeamish

1	"my summer was recently saved by two very different movies  
on opening night  i saw american pie 2 and laughed like a moron  
then a few nights later  i watched and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershmans greenfingers even though it didnt feature a trip to band camp  girlongirl action  or seann william scott  
however  i felt just as good leaving american pie 2 as i did after leaving greenfingers  which tells the offbeat tale of british murderer colin briggs  clive owen of croupier   
after spending roughly half of his life behind bars  he is transferred to a more lenient facility  edgefield  
the picaresque  rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a trade  while enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges  
at first  briggs doesnt want to be there  
hes used to living as a prisoner and wants to be left alone  
however  his ailing roommate  fergus  david kelly of waking ned devine   wears briggs down through his benign nature  
the two become friends  with fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift  
briggs is astonished when the violets grow in the limestone soil  and begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers  
after the prisons governor  warren clarke  reprimands them  hes awed at what briggs has accomplished  
and hes struck by an idea  briggs  fergus and the other men will grow a garden on the prisons grounds  
greenfingers  which is  inspired by actual events   becomes a bit like a sports movie after that  
despite their differences  the men come together and through hard work and love earn a spot at the big game  in this case a prestigious garden show  
one renegade  in this case  briggs  will prove to have talent  
of course  love will also rear its head  no  not  prison love    
to hershmans credit  he doesnt pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs  like last years lame marijuana comedy saving grace  
i had to keep pinching myself when i didnt see a single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies  or the men giving highfives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers  
the movie deals with people and scores on that concept  
its wonderful seeing briggs turn from a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again  
give credit to owen for keeping his cool in a part that begs for overacting  
his speech to the parole board about being reborn through gardening is the best scene of its kind since morgan freemans last stand in the shawshank redemption  
owens bedside scenes with kelly  who lends the film a human touch  are a marvel to behold  emotionally gripping without being sappy  
written by hershman  greenfingers contains plenty of laughs  
most come courtesy of helen mirren  who shines as the worldclass gardener who works with the inmates but fears for her daughter primrose  natasha little  when she starts dating briggs  
the mother cant believe what hell do if her daughter  burns the sunday roast   
nothing is forced in greenfingers  
the funny lines come forth naturally in conversations and not from punch lines  
primrose and briggs relationship takes awkward steps  
even when briggs decides to go back to edgefield  its done for reasons of loyalty  not because the movie requires him to do so  
after grimacing through the forced screwball antics of movies like americas sweethearts and the princess dairies  its an almost indescribable pleasure to see a director taking his time to tell a story very well

0	"terrence malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaptation of james jones world war ii novel  
unfortunately  he buried it within an overlong and overreaching 3hour long pseudoepic  
this is a shame because the film features an outstanding performance by nick nolte  
the best scene is when nick noltes character  lt  col  tall  is forced to deal with the direct refusal by capt  staros  elias koteas  to execute an order  
noltes reaction and transformation may be the best work of his career  
had terrence malick concentrated on the great performances of nolte and koteas as well as those by sean penn  woody harrelson  and john cusack  he could have made a truly great film  
instead  malick saddled the film with plodding pacing  unnecessary flashbacks  and a voiceover narration all designed to telegraph the great philosophical underpinnings of the story  
the narration was especially annoying as much of it sounded like very bad high school poetry  
with a lot of editing  the core story could be transformed into a truly classic war film  
hopefully  the dvd version of this film will feature options to suppress the narration  and perhaps will even provide for an alternate  shorter version of the film  
i give this film

1	"saving private ryan  dreamworks  running time  2 hours 48 minutes  
starring tom hanks  edward burns  tom sizemore and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the greatest war movie ever made   saving private ryan is an harrowing  saddening and riveting movie  
it may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion  but its certainly one of the best war movies made  and one of the best of 1998  
tom hanks stars as a captain whos troop has to find private ryan  damon  who has a ticket home because his three brothers have been killed in action  
action  drama and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france to find him  
after the disappointing amistad  1997  spielberg has returned to form with this excellent movie  
im not the war movie genre biggest fan  but i found this film to be gripping  and very scary  thanks to the excellent cast  direction and terrifying battle scenes  
tom hanks is superb  straying away from his usually soppy dramatic roles  such as in forrest gump  1994   
this time  he plays the role with gritty realism  and is much better for it  
occasionally he overacts the sentimentally  but he generally delivers a fine performance  
edward burns  looking a lot like armageddons ben affleck  also delivers a top notch performance  moving away from his roles in films such as shes the one  1996  tom sizemore makes less of an impact  but is still watchable  and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today  
spielberg directs very well  putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes  
and what battle scenes they are  
theyre truly terrifying  yet the audience cannot drag their eyes away from the screen  
the battle scenes are filmed with a jerky handheld camera  and the panic and confusion felt by the soldiers is emphasized by this technique  
the gore and violence isnt spared either  which body parts flying  and blood spurting  
this film is certainly not for kids and sensitive adults  
other factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece of 90s film making  
the cinematography is excellent  and the music score by john williams is also superb  
it is never intrusive  and adds to the drama onscreen  
but while they are thousands of good things great about private ryan  theres one major flaw that detracts the genius of the film  the writing  
it is unusually flat  with many of the speeches strangely weak  
the film never really makes any profound statements  
this is not a major gripe  as private ryan is a film of action  not words  
still  the script could of been a lot better  
thankfully  the actors help partly to rectify the situation with their great delivery of their lines  
saving private ryan  in the end  is an excellent film  but not the greatest war movie due to its weak acting  
this film should be viewed by everyone who has the stomach for it  as its rewarding and extremely worthwhile  
it really shouldnt be missed  and dreamworks skg has finally found its first hit movie

0	"a big  busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch  the great white hype stars samuel l  jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging payperview revenues is to  invent  a white contender  peter berg  to challenge his black heavyweight  champ   damon wayans   
  the logic is that people will pay more to see black vs  white than black vs  black   
he may be right  in an absurdly accurate way  but the film doesnt give us a reason to care  
as a scathing sports spoof  hype is just that  unfunny  unfocused  and  at times  just plain pointless  
as a commentary on race relations  its even  less  effective  
the dialogue is the best of this mess  lines like jon lovitz exclaiming  i cannot make caviar out of fish eggs   
writers tony hendra and ron shelton also do good on the street slang  though we never hear enough of it  
the script isnt strong enough  though  to support the aggressive camera work of director reginald hudlin  house party   
he comes across as absolute overkill  
the great white hype  almost  turns around at the end  at the big match  when hudlin attempts an extended gag of rockconcert proportions  
with costumed dwarfs  gangsta rappers  and the  champ  dressed as death  only then do we get a glimpse of the spoof that shouldve been

1	"men in black is an explosive mix of science fiction  action  and comedy that hits the target in every possible way  
although another alien movie  men in black succeeds in every way that independence day didnt  and towers above many other movies of its type  
the brilliant acting  especially by tommy lee jones as agent kay  is also as good as it gets  
director barry sonnenfeld  who was behind the camera for the addams family movies and get shorty  has crafted a masterpiece  
the story behind men in black is just as interesting as you would want it to be  
the men in black  or mib  are a topsecret governmental agency that is not known to exist  
the mib are responsible for  saving the world from the scum of the universe   
a though job  indeed  
the film opens with a truckload of illegal aliens  the human kind  being transported across the mexico border and into the united states  
presumably  these  aliens  are all migrant workers  
that is  until the mib show up and begin interrogating them  
agent kay selects a particular suspicious worker and takes him away from the other local authorities to discover that he is not an illegal human alien  but a real extraterrestrial alien  
when the alien makes a run for it  agent kay is forced to eliminate the alien with one of the mibs very unique weapons  and after one of the local law enforcement officers witnesses this bizarre occurrence  agent kay is forced to use another very unique device on them  
the device  described as  out of state   eliminates the memory of anyone it is used on  
from here  we are introduced to james edwards  played very well by will smith  
edwards  a police officer  is chasing a fleeing criminal  
the criminal gives a very good chase  and at one point when edwards confronts him  the criminal pulls out a very different looking weapon that disintegrated when it hit the ground  
edwards continues to chase the very athletic criminal to the top of a building  where the criminal informs edwards that he must let him go  because someone is after him  
edwards doesnt take this seriously  but when the criminal shows very nonhuman characteristics and leaps off the building  he begins to wonder  
back at the police station  agent kay shows up to ask edwards a few questions  
he informs edwards that is was  in fact  a nonhuman that he was chasing  and that the gun he pulled out was definitely not manmade  
he has edwards identify the gun  and asks edwards to come to the mib headquarters the following day  
edwards arrives and finds that he is involved in a recruiting process  along with various other men who seem a bit more qualified than he  
after goofing up for half of the time  edwards puts on a show at the firing range  and agent kay notes the reason why he feels edwards should be the man to join the mib  he chased down the  criminal  on foot  which is something that no one is supposed to be able to do  
in the meantime  an upstate new york farm has a very close encounter  
edgar  vincent donofrio   owner of the farm  investigates a strange crash landing and is attacked by the inhabitant of the flying object  which presumes to jump inside edgar and use his body as a human transport  
the  bug   as he is called  is an intergalactic terrorist who has come to earth to attempt to kill two ambassadors  
and it up to the mib  with newly recruited agent jay  formerly james edwards  to exterminate the bug and save the planet from intergalactic war  
men in black delightfully combines fastpaced action with often hilarious comedy  which is usually from will smith  although tommy lee jones opens up his comedic personality in this film  
the special effects are also very well done and are not the entire source of the plot  as in another big alien film from the past summer  
screenwriter ed solomon  writer of super mario bros  
and the upcoming xmen film  has surely struck gold with this story  
all ages will enjoy men in black  
it is an extremely fun film that you will want to see again  
although it runs a very quick and speedy 96 minutes  the entire film from beginning to end is a nonstop adventure  
the ending of the film  which ties up a few loose ends for one of the main characters  is also very well done  
a sequel is already being planned  so there is more to look forward to  
"
1	"in brief   this film needs no introduction  
if you havent heard of it  then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical  and if you havent seen it  well  i suspect youre in a small minority  
first things first  is it all its hyped up to be  
well  yes  and no  
its a good film  and theres a lot to like about it  but its not without its problems  
when i saw the first trailer for  titanic   it was when i went to see  bean  last summer  i think  my intial reaction was  aint that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful  reallife tragedy   
i mean  whats happened to hollywoods scriptwriters  have they run entirely out of new ideas  
gads  whatever next  i asked myself  how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme  
i was not entirely filled with anticipation  but then i wasnt alone in that respect  
its when it came out in the cinema  to rave reviews  well  mostly  and anyone whod been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice  
i didnt see the film until several months after its release  by which time my sister had seen it about four times    
so i went with a slightly more open mind  but i still didnt think id enjoy it much  
did i  yes and no  
mainly yes  im happy to say  
the first hour or so was beautifully done  not so much because of the scripting  ill talk about that later   but because the recreated ship and sets were stunning to look at  as was camerons directing  and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the  human  aspect of the story  the romance between rose  kate winslet  and jack  leonardo dicaprio   was enchanting  
the film is told via flashback  with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day  you knew that  a course  
      
well  its an often effective device to use in storytelling  though sometimes it can fall flat  
does it work here  
in script form it doesnt add all that much to the story  
what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart  whose stunning performance is the strongest  most moving of the film  
her presence brings a much deeper level of passion  and depth to the story  and though her appearances are relatively brief  the film would have suffered without her  
also impressive are dicaprio and winslet  who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue  and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving  
its an old story  you know  forbidden love ala romeo and juliet  but it works  and jacks  rescuing  rose  in both literal and figurative senses  and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching  
in fact  i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot  largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm  energy to the romance  
its engaging  touching and very enjoyable  
theres more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well  simply because you know its not going to be a happy ending  
which leads us to the second half of the film  
we all knew it was coming  
im sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it  because as hes stated in interviews  the real thrust of the story  for him  was the sinking  and the jackrose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film  
i think that understates the importance of the romance  as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die  
the iceberg arrives  and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour  
and it is an hour  
my goodness  we dont miss a second of that hour  
gratuitous  well  perhaps not by todays standards  im sure theres been far worse produced under the banner of  entertainment  in other films  
but i certainly wasnt prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be  
not that id expect the word  understatement  to be part of camerons vocabulary  he who brought us such  umm  vivid films as  terminator 2  and  aliens    
is it overdone  
i thought so  
understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy  
no  no one expected a happy ending  but i didnt quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the films second half  
still  whether it was overdone and heavyhanded or not  if it was the shockfactor cameron was after it worked  because i was shocked and moved  in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears  
you really couldnt help but get emotionally involved  whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of roses overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack  or that jack would rescue rose  or that they would both survive  
perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk  and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface  
the bit where rose lets go of jacks hand  while promising shell never let go in her heart was particularly heartwrenching  and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image  to put no fine a point on it  
i loved the ending  however  which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half  
so  weve established that the film is powerful and moving  if the last hour was rather excessive  
havent mentioned the script  
plotwise its ok  though the jackrose relationship was beautifully developed  but ive a feeling thats to the actors credit if anything  
as for the dialogue  well  titanic is set in 1912  
its a period drama  
but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned  
did they really use phrases like  goddamn it   
back in the turn of the century  
i doubt it  
would someone talk like this   do ya love the guy or what    
i doubt it  
is such dialogue as  i saw the iceberg  and i see it in your eyes now  not just a bit  clumsy  
yes it is  
a little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray  and cameron himself is to blame  he wrote the script   
stick with directing  dude  
but its more than redeemed by the acting  with dicaprio and winslet on fine form  ably supported by a strong cast  
star of the show was gloria stuart  though  why didnt she win that oscar   
after all  they were throwing oscars at  titanic  left  right and centre  but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee  
directingwise cameron does a spectacular job  
like i said  his vision was a bit excessive  but at least he directed it well  
i havent even mentioned james horners beautiful score  
utterly heavenly  though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it  
    
ive finished my rant  which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would  
just leaves a couple of questions  was it worth all those oscars  
hell  dont talk to me about oscars  
bloomin farce  
it was deserving in a number of departments  though  
last question  is it  as some suggest  one of the best films of alltime  
nope  i dont think so  
its certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films ive ever seen  but i dont think it quite ranks as one of my alltime favourites  
and as for the fact theyre reportedly making a  titanic 2   well i guess thats typical hollywood for you  
"
1	"call 911 for the cliche police if you must  but the eyes are the window to the soul  
the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze  paul newman  ralph fiennes  anthony hopkins  morgan freeman  
you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds  that the characters they play are real human beings  
we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor  but he had that unique quality in his eyes  
in gridlockd  an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire  shakur and his costar tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry  
shakur and roth play ezekiel  spoon  whitmore and alexander  stretch  rome  two detroit buddies who share a spoken wordjazz trio  an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie  thandie newton   
when a new years eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose  spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time  
they soon make a new years resolution to get into rehab  but that proves to be easier said than done  
as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough  spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy  confusion and red tape  
the government might be the least of their obstacles  however  as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer  and on the run from a nasty thug  vondie curtis hall   
in order for you to buy into gridlockd at all  you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism  unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie  they are going to government offices on new years day  in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all  
gridlockd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey  1991s falling down  which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles  
in falling down  michael douglas dfens  the characters personalized license plate  echoed in gridlockd by the drug lord drepers plates  whips out a gun because he cant get breakfast at mcdonalds  in gridlockd  spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center  
and where the unhinged dfens became a heroic surrogate for audiences  writerdirector vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation  
one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question   do you expect the world to stop    just 
because you picked today to clean up   
the world in gridlockd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down  but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time  
hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system  but perhaps not enough of them  
a significant chunk of gridlockd is devoted to spoon and stretchs flight from dreper and from the police  and those subplots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments  
in one scene  stretch scares off dreper by getting chummy with a police officer  another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenlysuspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures  
the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running  while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time  
hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the films main events  perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through selfdestructive behavior  
oh  the irony of it  
tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case  and living the life to back it up  
in gridlockd  shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him  
spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall  but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction  
mostly it comes through those eyes  eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta  
it is spoon who plays conscience to stretchs pure appetite  and roth plays stretch with a gleeful selfdestructiveness  he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again  which is as much an obstacle to spoons goal as any agency or enemy  
gridlockds most cruelly comic scene finds stretch  helping  spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife  and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him  
with friends like that  spoon doesnt need enemies  and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much  
the tragedy now is that we wont get more chances to see those eyes again

1	"warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest  craziest and hard hitting movie in his career  
based on a story concocted by himself  and also written by beatty  bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system  
beatty stars as senator jay bulworth  whos going through a nervous breakdown  
after hiring someone to kill him  he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about whats really happening in american politics  much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy  platt   
instead of everyone hating him  the american public love him  
however  inside his party  more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin  
and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina  berry   
its remarkable that this film was released at all  
much more open than the rather subdued primary colours  bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name  
the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny  and also somewhat true  
its great that beatty isnt afraid to let loose on a subject  
talking of beatty  hes excellent in the role of the demented senator  clearing having fun  
and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed  
even in dick tracy  he was the most straighten face actor  
  then again  he was the only characters face we could completely see   
the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping  which he does with gusto  and also quite well   
and seeing beatty as a homeboy has to be seen to be believed  
its nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself  
second best is oliver platt as the flustered  coke snorting assistant  who goes over the top when he finally snaps  
halle berry is fine  and sexy  as the intellectual nina  who comes to like the senator  
also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent  laurie metcalf as the exact same characters shes also played  and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife  who all contribute to the fun  
and  this being a political film  the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance  as   shock   himself  
the writing and directing  both by beatty  are above par  
the direction is very nearly sitcom like  but suits the film perfectly  and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well  
the script is funny  and the raps are actually well produced and humorous  and quite clever  
theyre not cringe inducing  at least  
the script makes many points about society in america today  and isnt afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system  
best of all  the film is thought provoking  but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather  and is very entertaining  
theres also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes  
bulworth is a film with many advantages  and few flaws  
perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping  but beatty does it so well its irrelevant  
in fact  theres very little against bulworth  except for the language which is very heavy  but then again it should be expected  
bulworth  then  is well worth watching

1	"disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched  
to see a disaster film with actual originality  or at least a decent plot twist  would definitely be a welcome surprise  
unfortunately  folks  its not likely  
dantes peak is cliched  and at times corny  but also pretty decent  
to be honest  i wasnt very interested in seeing this film  and word of mouth  as well as several reviews  didnt make it sound promising  
so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasnt bad at all  
its pretty run of the mill  but its not something i would say is merely  ok  to watch  
in case you dont know  dantes peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in its shadow  dantes peak  who wouldve guessed  eh    
pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and  perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof  is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future  
due to the lack of more substantial evidence  nobody warns the small town  and when they finally do  its in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows  
brosnan  all around good guy  will  of course  save the day  
  
  
or at least the mayor of dantes peak  linda hamilton   
naturally the two will become infatuated with one another  
  if you think i just ruined a plot development  you havent seen very many movies   
theres also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings  
and of course  the kids or the dog  at least one or the other  will do something heroic  
  
  
but hey  i dont want to ruin all the surprises  
if there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dantes peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time  i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself  
its not brain food  but it succeeds at what its meant to be  
  
  
an enjoyable  suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash

1	"that thing you do  
  r  tom hankss screenwriting and directorial debut  that thing you do   has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment  fun  lively  and ohsonice  
it is the latter quality  however  that becomes a hindrance  for this 60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast  
that thing focuses on the wonders  a teen rock band from erie  pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called  of course   that thing you do   
the groups members are  naturally a diverse group  theres brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy  johnathon schaech   girlcrazy lenny  steve zahn   the lead guitarist  a goofy  geeky type known only as the bass player  ethan embry   and the films center  guy  tom everett scott   the drummer who has aspirations in jazz  
along for the wonders ride to success is jimmys perpetually neglected galpal  faye  liv tyler   
hanks proves to be a capable writerdirector  deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964  which hanks calls  the last innocent year   
the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music  which  like the other recent period music film  grace of my heart  was expressly written for the film  hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunesbut not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger  which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled  its still playing in my mind as i write this   
it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors  eliciting charming  likable work from the entire cast  most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler  who is remarkable in delivering the films biggest and best dramatic moment  
the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early 60s  they do not appear to be 90s grungers playacting  retro   
yet for all the light  frothy charms of that thing you do   its nearly nice to a fault  
while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days  there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting  
everyone is so happy  basking in the glow of overnight success  marvelling at it allexcept toward the end  but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness  ending on an appropriately feelgood note  
there isnt much of an edge throughout that thingthe only thing that is remotely edgy is hankss turn as the wonders managerand thus becomes in danger of being so nice its bland  
but a little niceness goes a long way these days  and theres no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do   its just about impossible to hate  
its an inoffensive  enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming  if not singing   that thing you do   quite 
possibly for days  
to paraphrase a passage from the song  though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play  that thing you do

0	"phaedra cinema  the distributor of such neverheardof classics as  soft toilet seats    trailer  the movie   and  the one armed boxer vs  the flying guillotine   has sneaked its latest release   the sculptress   into a few theaters this weekend hoping to cash in on a handful of halloween holidaygoers looking for a right good scare  
  the sculptress  is a scary proposition all right  but not in the way its producers intended  
from the outset its easy to see why some of the larger  more reputable chains arent carrying it  the film looks like a straighttovideo release from the early 80s thats been dusted off  not very carefully  and reissued in theatrical format  
that staple of schlocky zmovies jeff fahey   the lawnmower man   plays a washedup shakespearean actor lacking in some basic people skills  
when hes not reliving his glory days in his ramshackle nob hill apartment  screaming scotchinduced  hamlet  soliloquies well into the night  hes out and about on the streets of san francisco stalking loose women  
faheys dobie sizes up his victims  actually just one  a peep show performer name of sylvie  dressed like one of the guys from kraftwerk  and approaches them in the ridiculous attire of a bavarian count replete with a cane  dark glasses  and a false beard  just in time for halloween    
  do you have a castle   
sylvie asks dobie seductively when he flashes the bulging contents of his wallet outside a coffee shop  
  jah  
with ze many turrets  is dobies perplexing reply  
the real  star  of the film  and i use that term extremely loosely  is katie wright  who plays the sculptress of the title  
sarah is new in town  studying at the prestigious sf art institute under the mentorship of a  genius  frenchman  played by the beretwearing patrick bauchau  
thats convenient  because sarah would one day like to live and work in paris  you wont believe the films final shot  with its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop and  rosemarys baby  inspired imagery   
bauchaus character criticizes sarahs work publicly  her clay busts keep turning into gargoylesperhaps shes possessed    
by an incubus     but he still manages to talk her into dinner  
whereas wright does a decent english accent  her talents pretty much end there  
on the other side of the wall  dobies troubled past is succinctly summarized in a scene in which he thumbs through an old scrapbook of newspaper clippings with headings like  actor delivers a stunning macbeth   actor courted by hollywood studio    actor renounces hollywood for priesthood   and  prostitute fingers priest in sex scandal   
the films plot could have been just as easily condensed  
  artist moves in next door to shakespearean psychopath   
  yawns ensue   
so dobie rants and raves and sarah chips away at large blocks of granite till way past their bedtimes  
late in the film  their paths finally cross with mindnumbing results  
nobody else in the apartment complex appears to mind all the racket  but one old dear does go ballistic when sarahs bathtub overflows  
no  we dont see wright in the tub  or fahey for that matter   and the gore quotient is virtually nil  so for a horror film  the sculptress  is surprisingly lacking  
the only thing worth looking at is san francisco  and writerdirector ian merrick manages to make even it look dreary  windswept  and deserted  
  the sculptress  isnt even bad enough to be fun  
luckily  a limited release has made it easy to avoid

it is not an easy situation  but a perfectly plausible one  the panorama in which breakdown musters its throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness

when they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest  jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver  who later  will be an important player in the plot department  
minutes later after that  their brand new  strikingly red  jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops  
jeff cannot detect the cars problem  so he allows amy to take a ride with red  j  
t walsh   a heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town  where jeff will meet her at a local diner  
it is facile for the film to turn into a pseudosuspenser  but instead it opts for maximum fervor  
jeff manages to restart the car himself  but when he arrives at the diner  she is nowhere in sight  
disconcerted  the coffee shops bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife  a town about twenty miles from here  
there  trouble arises  
and i shall not reveal anything else  since that would be spoiling the fun of whats head  
there are many involving  tight scenes in breakdown but the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars and a huge truck  will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam  
it is a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of good vs evil  and rooting for the good guys  in this case jeff  
kurt russell is one of the few topnotch hollywood actors which doesnt overblow his acting  and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses  
so you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letterperfect  
suffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation  from a jolly man  to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one  
not many wellpaid actors can deliver these type of performances  but russell is one of them  
as an everyday man  he pulls it off extremely convincingly  what also surprised me more was his rigorous physicality  which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films 93 minutes  
although the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences  very well done  yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with  
faced with an enigma about his wifes whereabouts  the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters  including the cryptic villains  who in essence  make the movie what it is  
whats most impressive however  is the feature debut by writerdirector jonathan mostow  
mostow  hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle  alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot  efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nailbiting suspense sought for in a well made affair  
contrary to most american thrillers  he doesnt rely on visual flair  but on aesthetics and substance  
after breakdown  he should gain vast notoriety  
the villains in the movie arent your routine outofthisworld idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective  
the baddies in breakdown  all well acted  are normal  seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer  conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder  
the movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks  and  of all things in the world  it is becoming rather easy to root for villains  jon voight in anaconda  in todays movies  
worth a special mentioning is j  t walsh  who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision  as the leader of the gang  he renders a deliciously wicked performance  temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for  
alfred hitchcock used suspenseand action not only to stimulate  but as a way of aiding his audiences fascination in his stories  which were slowly realizing mans biggest fears  
breakdown yields exactly that  
it magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man  acting like an ordinary man  looking like an ordinary and some sort of superhero  
despite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock  i think  would approve of breakdown

1	"  a breed apart  casts rutger hauer as a crazy  birdloving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner  
a bit hard to swallow  
thats only the first of many improbabilities in this film  
hauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping the birds on his island safe  while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector  
turner is the woman caught between the two men  
  a breed apart  isnt a bad movie  exactly  
indeed  i found myself rooting for both the hauer and boothe characters  even though their goals couldnt be more different  
the problem with the film is that there are just too many inconsistencies  
for example  early on in the film  hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at  his  birds  
later on  the rednecks come back for revenge with four other people  and hauer kills a few of them  
i have a tough time believing that the police wouldnt get involved at that point  
another problem is the silly lovetriangle that develops  
i didnt care one way or the other who ended up with turner  
i was more interested in finding out which of the two men would be victorious in their respective missions  
however  despite this uninteresting subplot  turner did manage to give a great performance as the woman who reminds the two men that sometimes theres more to life than money and birds  
as for hauer  hes an actor ive always admired  
he has a penchant for picking strange and unusual characters  
and this one is no exception  
hes frequently seen riding around his island on a white horse  wearing pirates clothing  and holstering a crossbow  
despite all his eccentric mannerisms  though  hauer always manages to let the human side of his character shine through  
for example  theres a scene in which he barks at turner and her son because they came onto his island a day early  
he comes off as crazy loner in that scene  but a few minutes later  he is apologizing to turner  and we believe his intentions  
soon after  we find out hes a vietnam vet  and his actions become fairly clear to us  
  a breed apart  isnt a great movie by any means  but it does contain good performances by all three leads  and its worth seeing for that reason alone

 excerpt from twister production notes 
im sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes  or twisters  before  
i for one  have only seen the devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv and personally  i feel tornadocaused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes and earthquakes         that is until i saw twister  
the destruction caused by twisters may be precise  not widespread but it moves very fast and its path of destruction is unpredictable  
it will suck in cars  houses  livestock  etc      
basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground and in twister  youll get to see all this  close up  
twister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers  
these people are basically outoftheirmind and for the sake of obtaining data on twisteroccurrences  they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes  trying to get as close as they can      that 
is if the tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them  
jo  helen hunt  is the leader of this pack of kamikazes  
while they are gearing up for the motherofallstorms as predicted by satellite recon  bill  bill paxton   a former co leader of the team returns to settle some divorce papers with jo  
apparently  bill has left his rogueish days for greener and more practical pastures  as a television weatherman  
he catches up with his oldself and follows the pack like the good ole days  bringing his wifetobe melissa  jamie gertz  along  a citybred woman toting around with a handphone  
jo has finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurements of a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable earlywarning system can be implemented  
the problem is  the device has to be placed very near the twister  and in its path  which is practically unpredictable  of destruction in order for it to function  
to add to their current challenge  there is another group of storm chasers that is corporationfunded led by jonas  cary elwes  and they too have a similar device  
thus begins the race  jos cheap government equipment with beatenup vehicles against jonass hightech computers and satellite linkups with their sleek  black allterrain vans  
plot wise  there are not really anything to shout about  
twister is as predictable as any summer boxoffice hit can get  
there is the danger of the twister  the competition with jonasos more welloff team and of course  the settling of differences between jo and bill  this part gives the film its human substance   
helen hunt  bill paxton and the rest of the actorsactresses give only average performances and all of them take back seat to the main thespian in this movie  the twister itself  
thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm  lucasfilms industrial light and magic   we get to see the terror and destruction caused by tornadoes up close  from stripping barns and houses to lifting up livestock  
jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility  thanks to his years of experience as a director of photography for action films  for action sequences  
like his previous film speed  the tornado sequences  which are essentially the action sequences  are well visualised and edited  
audiences will be holding tight to their chairs everytime a tornado comes on screen  
the surround sound effects sure does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister  
  the cinema must at the very least support digital sound to fully appreciate this  twister is definitely an effectdependent movie  
now that id4 fever has begun to reside  and people are getting bored of watching will smith whoop ets ass for the umpteenth time       twister is your sure bet of 7 bucks well spent  
watch it in a good theatre    please  
the flying inkpots rating system   wait for the video  
   a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha  
    pretty good  bring a friend  
     amazing  potent stuff  
      perfection  
see it twice

1	"this remake of  la cage aux folles  features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their sons future inlaws  
the couple  robin williams and nathan lane  are about as archetypal  or as the less kind might put it  stereotypical  gays possible  
williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star  
they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode  
williams is excellent as should be no surprise  
gene hackman as rightwing potential fatherinlaw is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles  
the real star is lane  
his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straightshooting uncle is hilarious  
perhaps it is a personal failing on my part  but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it  
luckily  for me at least   it doesnt last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men  their son and the deception  
the question of stereotypes is a touchy one  
these guys personify the homophobic gay image  
you can almost hear the swishing  
if you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world  youll be outraged  
but if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals  youll love it  
your choice

1	"one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsys wedding  
and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it  
her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald  who hasnt made a worthwhile film since 1986  
but the fact is  betsys wedding is also an alan alda film  
and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years  alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects  including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life  
written and directed by alda  betsys wedding is a vibrant sliceoflife  mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor  
aldas comic elixir is smooth and refreshingand a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare  
as bride and groom  molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film  but they are by far the least interesting  
walsh is a nonentity  with all the screen presence of a door knob  
ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain  
she looks hideous with her shortcropped orange hair  red lipstick and grotesque outfits  
shes supposed to be a dress designer  but she looks more like a clown  
and to make matters worse  ringwalds performance matches her appearance  
thankfully  alda keeps ringwalds screen time to a minimum  he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters  
the wedding is just a device to bring together the brides workingclass  italian family and the grooms rich  gentile family  
ringwalds folks are homey and downtoearth  with alda as her freespirited father  madeline kahn as her practical mother  and ally sheedy as her lonely sister  
walshs clan  on the other hand  is prim  proper and ostentatious  
when the two families meet and mingle  the movie becomes a story of culture clash  or as one character puts it   money versus values   
ally sheedy  in a wonderfully understated performance  is one of the films most pleasant surprises  
sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body  
its anthony lapaglia  however  who seizes the spotlight  
lapaglia plays stevie dee  a suave  overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with oldfashioned chivalry  
lapaglias sincere but dimwitted character is a riot  
and whats uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro  with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure  
lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting  and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his rolemodel and partly a ripoff  
i dont know whether to say a star is born or a star is reborn  but i do know that lapaglias overthetop performance should not be missed  
the scrumptious comic acting  however  extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia  
joe pesci  in particular  sinks his teeth into his role as aldas unscrupulous brotherinlaw  a slum lord with mob ties  who is cheating on his wife  catherine ohara   
alda  faced with challenge of both directing and acting  somehow finds just the right comic touch as the brides financiallystrapped father  a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet  
the film adopts aldas psychological point of view as he tries to one  plan the wedding  and two  pay for it  
as a filmmaker  aldas style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful  
and while he doesnt have the comic genius of a woody allen  alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy

charlotte rampling  given the chance to portray an older  yet still sexual  woman runs with it  bringing us into the mind of the character  
her chemistry with bruno cremet is startlingly natural  
as marie returns from her first date with vincent  she sits on the couch with jean  
did he kiss you   he asks  
the mood the two create is incredibly intimate and sad  
ozon   water drops on burning rocks    see the sea    who cowrote the script with emmanuelle bernheim  marcia romano  and marina de van  has turned in a more mature work than his previous  creepy  see the sea   
while he cleverly never lets us see jean enter the water that fateful day  leaving a number of possibilities  accident   suicide   escape  
 open  he definitely tips his hand towards a certain outcome  
cinematography by antoine hiberli and jeanne lapoirie   water drops on burning rocks   glides around marie  their 180 shot as she initially searches the oceans horizon for a sign of jean conveys her panic  or captures ramplings exotic face in mood divining closeup  
in an inventive fantasy scene  marie imagines jeans hands massaging her feet while in a state of autoarousal  
his two hands become four  then more combined with her own  becoming almost a one person orgy and recalling roman polanskis  repulsion   
original music by philippe rombi quietly adds to the overall melancholy  
  under the sand  is a unique portrait of loss  
it would make an fascinating double bill with liv ullmanns  faithless  from earlier this year  another character study of a woman facing loss for different reasons

0	"    the following review contains some harsh language    
but what did you expect when you clicked on this title  
    
cast  kristen holly smith  danica sheridan  alex boling  michael dotson  sonya hensley  janet krajeski  sabrina lu  dionysius burbano  calvin grant  jeff b  harmon written and directed by  jeff b  harmon running time  97 minutes 
  the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside   
 blatz balinski  danica sheridan  laments the fact that her lesbian lover  april  kristen holly smith   has just received a telegram from her exfiance  
isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot  smith   a resident of the small town of bumfuck  arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson  michael dotson   
when april gets extreme cold feet she runs home  sticks a gun in her mouth  and pulls the trigger  
instead of killing herself  she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos  an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed  except for lance  the homosexual toilet cleanerslave   
april loves her new home and friends  but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up  
mr  and ms  pfferpot  director jeff b  harmon and janet krajeski  decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr  sigmoid colon  also jeff b  harmon   who claims he can cure homosexuality  
in actuality  dr  colon is homosexual as well and begins his special  treatment  on dick dickson  unbeknownst to dick   
when april turns down dicks demand for her to return to bumfuck  he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambostyle  
instead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance  alex boling  and the two of them  along with april and her lover blatz  get married  
  note to the filmmaker  why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that im assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided   
aprils parents  feeling like there is no recourse  call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb  whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer  their way  
the bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the  circuitry  and they rewire it and send it back to washington d  c   destroying it  
mr  and ms  pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own  
im not sure if writerdirectorcostar jeff b  harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs  
either way  he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie  
the film opens with a preacher running a small africanamerican child out of town  and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan  during a jaunty musical number   preceded by remarks about  gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others  such as the jews   
if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be  then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film  but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i cant help but feel like he had some serious intent  
as for the entire central theme of the movie  im afraid that its one that i just dont get  
i tried to keep an open mind while watching it  but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes  
it was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society  
how does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of nonacceptance  
im not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society  but dont force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you arent going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me  
again  maybe im missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make  but if so  i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully  
as far as musical comedies go  isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical  but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy  
despite the disturbing visuals   mom and apple pie  stuck with me for the rest of the day  
speaking of disturbing visuals   wedding bells aint ringing  could have been a decent song  but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying  
  im a lesbian   which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular  is also pretty good  but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms  smith  
its mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based  
the other performers are decent  save for the rosie odonnell like performance given by danica sheridan  
i have no inherent problem with her character  it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired  
one particular musical number   lesbian rock   was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my filmgoing life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan  
the film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll  
the remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs   lesbian rock  included  and the ridiculously presented antinukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film  
once the  isle of lesbos reprise  was reached  i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all  
why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end  
isle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www  indieunderground  com  
the transfer is pretty clean  and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent  and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1  85  1  
in many respects  isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential  like a rocky horror for the new millennium   
this film is by no means my cup of tea  but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it  
if you think it might be for you  then by all means seek it out  
i  on the other hand  will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator    
wait  arent gladiator films considered to be    
oh  never mind

1	"robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible  godgiven gifts  but are able to act like ordinary people  
in  the natural   1984   he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs  the baseball player who was destined to be  the best there ever was   but still acted like a humble farm boy  
in  butch cassidy and the sundance kid   1969   he was the most dangerous shot in the west  yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly goodlooking charmer  
even in  indecent proposal   1993   where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love  redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency  especially when reciting a tale of lost love  
in his latest film   the horse whisperer   based on the bestselling novel by nicholas evans  redford again plays such a character  
redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie  i suppose the character of tom booker  a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses  was just too good to pass up  
despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses  a magazine article coins the phrase  horse whisperer  to describe his uncanny talent   booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life  
bookers talents are taxed into service by annie maclean  kristin scott thomas   a new york magazine editor whose daughter  grace  scarlett johansson   was recently in a horrible accident  
the accident  which is filmed with gutwrenching horror  happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses  an eighteenwheeler kills graces friend  severely wounds and traumatizes graces horse  pilgrim  and causes grace to lose part of her right leg  
annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed  grace will be healed as well  which leads her to booker  
at first  she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse  but that doesnt work  
instead  she packs up grace and pilgrim  leaves her husband  robert  sam neill  behind  and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother  frank  chris cooper   and his sisterinlaw  diane  dianne wiest   
in many ways  the film is like a journey  both literally and symbolically  
the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal  and its hard not to see annie and graces leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs  country  
in  the horse whisperer   country is clearly the victor  
the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness  and it is not until the characters arrive in the wideopen spaces of montana that graces anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate  annies controlling nature begins to relax  and pilgrim once again learns to trust people  
redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed  a river runs through it  six years ago  
in many ways   the horse whisperer  comes from the same poetic vein as  river   and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less cameratime on the grass and mountains  
but then  that would ruin the magic  
much of the films photography is truly elegant  and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land  
to further emphasize this  redford and cinematographer robert richardson   natural born killers    platoon   cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film  which takes place in new york  with mostly cold  harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1  85  1 aspect ratio  when the action shifts to montana  richardson switches to softfocus and natural lighting  and the screen widens to a 2  35  1 aspect ratio  
in terms of the story itself   the horse whisperer  gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david leans  a brief encounter   1945  and clint eastwoods 1995 adaptation of robert james wallers  the bridges of madison county   richard lagravenese  coscreenwriter here also adapted  bridges    
although  the horse whisperer  has a strong romantic sensibility  i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story  
it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband whos being left behind for this brief  heartsweeping affair  but there rarely is  
in  the horse whisperer   the thankless role of being the fuddyduddy husband falls to sam neill  
he plays the character as a decent  hardworking man who is a good husband and father  his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him  
he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away  but simply because he happens to be a normal  fairly uninspiring man  
there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character  
it shows booker and robert going into a horse pen  booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all  while robert looks somewhat frumpy and outofplace in a baseball cap  
as they enter the pen  booker assuredly swings over the fence  while robert hesitates  then opens the gate and  in a goofy moment  forgets to close it behind him  
its a small scene  but it clearly demonstrates the movies thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness  
after all  booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it  
the best scenes in  the horse whisperer  tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie  but rather the healing process of grace and her horse  
although bookers horsetraining methods are mythical and unrealistic  the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing  
these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace  some of which are humorous  and all of which are tender and true  
at some point  i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more  
nevertheless  redford is obviously a romantic at heart  and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film  
there are no dramatic sex scenes  but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slowdancing  always moving ever closer together  that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together  
although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character  there are enough moments like that which make  the horse whisperer  worth the price of admission

0	"the happy bastards quick movie review 
damn that y2k bug  
its got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother  william this time  in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on  
little do they know the power within    
going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there  virus still feels very empty  like a movie going for all flash and no substance  
we dont know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere  we dont know the origin of what took over the ship  just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir   and  of course  we dont know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout  
here  its just  hey  lets chase these people around with some robots   
the acting is below average  even from the likes of curtis  
youre more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20  
sutherland is wasted and baldwin  well  hes acting like a baldwin  of course  
the real star here are stan winstons robot design  some schnazzy cgi  and the occasional good gore shot  like picking into someones brain  
so  if robots and body parts really turn you on  heres your movie  
otherwise  its pretty much a sunken ship of a movie

0	"this is the first film in what would become the most successful series of horror films of all time  
a fair warning to those of you who might be inclined to watch this movie for the first appearance of everyones favorite goaliemaskwearing homicidal maniac  
jason  the guy who single handedly controlled the overpopulation problem around the crystal lake area  doesnt start his quest to find the most interesting household item with which to kill someone until the sequel  
while he does have a small role in this film  we the audience have to depend on another blood thirsty maniac to rack up the body count  
the plot  like every other friday the 13th movie goes something like this  crazed killer murders as many unsuspecting teenagers as hesheit possibly can in the space of a 90 minute movie  
the reasons that the afore mentioned unsuspecting teenagers come into contact with the bloodthirsty killer are usually of little importance to the story  
but for those of you out there that might actually care about such trivial matters in a movie such as a plot  here are the basics  
a bunch of unsuspecting teens get a summer job at a long closed summer camp  
they are days away from the arrival of the kids and they are spending their time fixing the place up and making sure it is ready for the kids  
sadly  they start being butchered one by one by the bloodthirsty killer  
at this point i would usually say something about the quality of acting  directing or maybe something about the high quality of the production  
since im not going to do that  feel free to assume that if i did  it wouldnt be positive  
i will say that this movie looks as if it was made for about a hundred bucks  and that includes the actors salaries  
if you are used to recent horror films like scream  you are in for a bit of a surprise  
the only saving grace for friday the 13th is that it was really the first of its kind  with the killer taking real pride in their work  
using as many methods of murder as they could  
none of this single murder weapon stuff life that unimaginative leatherface in chainsaw massacre  or the creatively stifled imagination of halloweens michael myers who just used brute force or a really big kitchen knife  
nope  in the friday the 13th movies  you can always count on the killer taking great pride in his work  
one fun fact about this movie is that the cast includes a very young kevin bacon  although after this movie it is a wonder he ever worked again  
the main reason to see friday the 13th is if you want to watch all of the series from the beginning  
if not  stick with the later films with jason  everyones favorite hockey fan  
friday the 13th is the sort of movie that is fun to sit down and get a couple of scares from  just dont sit down expecting a whole lot

1	"i didnt realize how apt the name of this movie was until i called the mpaa  the motion picture association of america  the folks who decide whats g  nc 17  pg  r or x  to ask why the preview was rated r  so that we can make some sense of their response  let me tell you about the movie itself  
  the celluloid closet  is a documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades  
its brilliant  funny  naughty and extremely poignant  
it tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that  as a rule  gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen  
regardless of how veiled  or how sordid  the presence of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if theyre not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be  
the movie itself is rated r  and for good reason  
it contains scenes of bloody  violent gay bashing and graphic  uninhibited  sex  
as with any movie  i appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time  so i can decide for myself whether to see the movie with a friend  a date  my 11 year old niece  alone or not at all  
but  thats the movie  
now back to the preview  
prior to this film being theatrically released  it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo  i had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times  
there was no nudity  no violence  no bad language  nothing that i could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for a general audience  okay  whoopi goldberg did refer to someone  boning  someone  but the last i knew that wasnt one of the seven words you cant say on tv   
except for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing  
hmmmmm  
when i inquired about the rating on the trailer  a very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from  the handbook  that a trailer approved for all audiences could contain  no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone   
hello  i was in the office and it was the middle of the day  
bravely  i pursued  
  ive seen that trailer  oh    
probably half a dozen times   i gulped    
  and i dont remember that scene   
  well   she chirped  
  its there  
our little eyes are trained to see that   
no really  
in the words of dave barry   i am not making this up   
they are  trained  to  see that   
when someone who was shocked at the rating the first time and made a note to watch it carefully the following five times or so managed to let it slip past her  
gosh  i certainly dont mean to question the mpaa  or  the handbook   
i would  however  like to suggest that its they who are in the closet on this one  
and the light aint good in there  
but  having seen  the celluloid closet   and being one of a handful of straight people involved in a primarily gay and lesbian weekly bible study  email me and ill give you the details   none of this was any big surprise  
the point of the movie was that homosexuality  even in the politically correct 90s  is ridiculously perceived as a threat to a mostly heterosexual society  
a point well made in this candid and honest film  
now  i could go off on the mpaas ruling that a trailer must contain  no homosexuality or lesbianism  and ask how that is defined  particularly in light of some of the things  both sexual and nonsexual  that ive watched straight people do in trailers  
i just dont feel the need to go there  because it seems so obvious  
ill instead suggest that the mpaa reevaluated their evaluation criteria  
let the ratings reflect not subject content  like  sex  and  violence   
let them reflect attitude content  
in the future  id be interested in knowing whether the movie is rated d for disrespectful or s for stereotyped  
then id truly be able to make an informed decision about how i spent my time

1	"john carpenter directed this stylish and gory vampire flick to which has its good side and its bad  
its held up by some good performances and dazzling special effects leading up to an ending thats pretty satisfying  
james woods gives an outstanding performance that almost covers up the movie  
the good side  some neat scenes of vampires and violence  
the bad  no scares  
yes thats right  even though being directed by one of horrors most cherished directors  vampires is the least bit scary  if not at all  
james woods stars as jack a vampire hunter out to stop the plans of the master vampire valek played by thomas ian griffith whom wants vampires to walk in the daylight  
daniel baldwin plays his sidekick montoya  a wisecracking guy who really isnt that funny  
in the opening scene jack along with montoya and the team of vampire hunters  find an abandoned house to which vampire occupy  
of course we all know sunshine kills vampires  and that is just how they kill these vampires  hooking them to ropes and dragging them outside letting them burn to death  
after throwing a party for what happened  the vampires that did not die come back to trash it  
they kill almost all of jacks team  leaving only a few alive  
sheryl lee plays a prostitute katrina who was bitten by valek  but not yet turned into a vampire  
she is rescued by jack and  flees with them on their search for valek  
they have to fight theyre way against vampires  leading up to a finale that is welldone with great special effects  
vampires definately could have been done better  
the makeup  special effects and story are first rate  but there is no scares or terror that the film could have had  
it to me had more humor than horror  almost being compared to fright night with the mix of violence and comedy  
john carpenter does a great job of directing this film  
he eases through some tough times and saves the flaws  which are noticeable but forgettable  
the script is clever and funny  with many lines that make us laugh out loud  
i much enjoyed vampires with a few exceptions  
its one of those films you see but dont take to heart  
you enjoy the time you spent and go on  
the recently released psycho is the same way  its not as good as youd hope but it is fun and entertaining  
vampires is a good horror flick with no scares but plenty of other content to please the viewer

1	"in one of my many videos i have attained from the local library  casablanca was my third classic in some weeks  
the others being citizen kane and vertigo  yes  i am trying to see as many of afis greatest movies ever made as i can   
but  casablanca stood out from the rest for me  it was actually watchable  
what most hail as the greatest american film ever  casablanca isnt so much a love story as a political frenzy with a love triangle thrown in  
it seems that star humphry bogart spend about 85 percent of the movie with various leaders of the nation instead of with ingred bergman  
that annoyed me  as did the ending  
why didnt the plan turn around    
surprisingly  i enjoyed the film  
i liked bogarts character and his acting  not over the top as most actors in his era   
i once read about if you had a choice to be in a movie  which one would it be  and a women said casablanca  
at first i was thinking to myself  why   
then  as i watched the film again  i understood why  
the movie is very well done and the script topnotch  although i doubt i understood more than half of the political mumbo jumbo  
casablanca is  in my mind  no classic  like solaris   but it is a good film and stylishly shot  
hey  hollywood  how about this  a remake with harrison ford and anne heche  
now that would be a classic  
"
1	"i know what i would do with 4  4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site  especially if i were with jacob and lou  
  huh   
well  in any event  that is the situation hank  paxton  finds himself in  
he and his dimwitted brother jacob  thorton  and tubby friend lou  brent briscoe  come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck  
against his better judgement  hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities  
the rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret  and is it worth it  
a simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things  clay pigeons and even fargo  and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle  
oh  and its much better than any of those  
sam raimi took a departure from his normal freakshow horrormonkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture  
he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do  
i think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course  
one of the films components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malicks the thin red line  
in malicks three hour boreathon  he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story  
it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass  a small bird  or a flowing body of water  
sure  there were obvious metaphorical connections  but there was no subtlty to his efforts  
raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters  
i think most viewers may miss the comparison  but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film  
and then theres billy bob thorton  who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood  
if it can continute to produce people like thorton  hollywood will be ok  
he gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here  
it is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade  but is is just as complex  if not more so  
jacob is slow and simple  and yet we so often see him deep in thought  
i wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say  or didnt know how to say  or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said  
here he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry  
though the plot is somewhat unoriginal  it has a very appealing new twist in its characters  
paxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group  a far cry from chet in wierd science   
perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advicegiving wife  but she certainly doesnt do anything ruin the picture  
a simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty unredeeming  
but at least this one has an important message  unlike so many of its counterparts

0	"deserves recognition for  making this relatively youthful critic feel extremely old and crotchety20 
capsule review  this is what feelgood family entertainment has morphed into in the 90s  an hourandahalf commercial  disguised as an unnecessary remake  in which the defining image is that of a grown man launching a volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his ass  
  between this  rocketman  and george of the jungle  disney has recently eclipsed longtime champion troma as the studio most likely to include a fart joke in a film   
as the absentminded professor who invents the titular computergenerated goop  a listless robin williams manages the difficult task of making original lead fred macmurray seem sprightly  
the only thing that made this film borderline tolerable for me is my newlyfounded but firm belief that writerproducer john hughes is going to spend his eternal afterlife being conked in the noggin by all of the different blunt instruments hes used for comedic effect in films like this and the odious home alone series  
take your kids to see boogie nights instead  
"
0	"  mercury rising  has numerous flaws  but there is one that really stands out  its central plot device is unnecessary  
thats right  
the major aspect of the film  that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy  action flicks could be dropped from the beginning  and the movie would turn out exactly the same  if not better  
this central device is the fact that a nineyearold boy is autistic  
his name is simon  and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow  alec baldwin  wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it  
simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film  and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent  unfair world against his will  with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him  
the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of  mercury rising   
i suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simons character and his relationship with willis  but here it is lost  
miko hughes  the young actor who plays simon  goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic  he walks slowly  drawls his words  kicks and screams when hes touched  and has a hard time looking at other people  
its a difficult role for an adult  much less a young child  to play  and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isnt playing like hes autistic  
unlike dustin hoffmans performance in  rain man  or leonardo dicaprios in  whats eating gilbert grape   we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting  
however  unlike  rain man  which used its characters autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story   mercury rising  could go right about its generic  predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid  
hell  he doesnt even have to be shy  
in fact  the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role  rather than just being carted around under willis arm  
willis character  art jeffries  is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything  
he becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simons house  where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide  
of course  we know that isnt the way it happened happen because we saw an evil  squarejawed government hitman with a meanlooking crewcut knock off the parents  
simon was able to get away  and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet  which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked  
jeffries  who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it  knows there is something more  and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon  
this is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simons parents is crawling everywhere  attempting to kill simon at the hospital  on the highway  and every other place he goes  
late in the movie  jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey  kim dickens  who he meets at a coffee shop  
of all the hardtobelieve aspects of the movie  this is the worst  
i can believe in the decency of the human heart  but staceys character is far too accommodating  
not only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery  she lets him into her apartment at two oclock in the morning when she knows the police is after him  and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent  
the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point  
the movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences  but even here  mercury rising  doesnt rise to the challenge  
the movie was directed by harold becker  who has made some good suspense films including  sea of love   1989  and  malice   1993   but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion  
there is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman  played by peter stormare  that is so ineptly directed  shot and edited  that i had no idea 1  exactly where they were on the streetcar  2  who was hitting who  and 3  where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were  
the grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building  and features a harrowing  yawn  scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building  not because he has to  but because its more suspenseful that way  
taken as a whole   mercury rising  is an tepid  confused movie that lacks style  wit  and any traces of a sense of humor  
usually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles  but here he is too straight and serious  
this is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time  but it ends up failing on both fronts  
maybe the book was better  but the way its handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore

0	"hey  ive got a great idea for a movie  
ok  here it is  well get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so  
whats that  
sounds too boring  
ok  how about this then  we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours  but half of them are angry looks and half of them are  im in pain   
looks  
whats that  
that still doesnt sound funny to you  
how about if we through in some  ewwwww   
looks  
still not funny  
if you answered  no  that doesnt sound funny   then  ding ding ding   
youre absolutely correct  
for richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple  played by tim allen and kirstie alley  who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant  wayne knight  best know as newman on tvs  seinfeld   gets them in trouble for tax evasion  
what ensues is a badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell  
what makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs  
  
  
namely  talent  
backing up  the married couple is brad and caroline sexton  allen and alley   a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else  but in reality are on the brink of divorce  
just as their marriage seems to be hanging from its final thread  brad discovers that his accountant  bob lachman  knight   has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sextons names  
the irs catches on  but since everything points back to the sextons and not lachman  there is nothing much to do  
  
  
except run away and join an amish community  
first time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckleoutloud moments  and even some decent laughs here and  way  over there  but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that youll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn  
alley is absolutely unwatchable  and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade  which  i inform you  was total b  s    
allen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons  nor are they very convincing as an amish couple  
this entire movie is one bad illconceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning  
the amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing  
its such a trite  stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast  noticing that theyre all predominantly tv figures  were probably the only ones they could get  
bryan spicers directing doesnt help one bit  either  
in fact  listing spicers filmography  which includes the first  power rangers  movie and the big screen adaption of mchales navy  is more of an insult than a r  sum   
now that ive pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground  i will let you in on the best thing about it  
it bumped seven films up a notch on my  worst of  1997 movie list  
thats right  thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for the years worst  six films are now not seemingly as bad  and a smile like yours  previously inhabiting the number ten spot  now doesnt have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list  
if you look at it in that respect  for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all

0	"well there goes another one  
sadly this like other movies this year wasnt good  
this one being almost as bad as the omega code but not quite  
from the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad  and well i guess i was right  
with bad excuses for acting  a horrible screenplay and straightout bad direction the bachelor is a terribly unfunny movie that doesnt work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance  
the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best  
the movie is troubled from the start because chris odonnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date  
here is the stupid plot  chris odonnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend  he meets anne  rene zellwegar  they instantly hit it off and are together for three years  
jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up  
he really doesnt realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her  what he wants i never did catch   
so he proposes in a really bad way  and she shoots him down and is very mad  
he of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any  
then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars     as 
long as he marries before the next day at 6  05 pm  
now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her  or get married to someone else to get the money itself  leading to an unfunny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths  
ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest  cliched  silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs  
even the supporting roles of artie lange  hal holbrook and ed anser arent even good  
the plot was a good idea  but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old  
the choppy dialogue and bad directing dont help things any  
even though chris odonnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies  he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him  
rene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming  sweet and likable performance  as usual  and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout  
her sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen  
brooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a bigheaded mogul who after a while became routine and old  
one really cant help but think that we have seen this stuff before  
its not like this is an original idea and in the end  everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness  
the bachelor works on no good levels and in fact doesnt work at all  
ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul  and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career  
chris odonnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal  
he seems held back and really doesnt get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old  
artie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and unnerving  
why the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie  with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know  
maybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success  and sometimes i dont agree with other critics on movies  even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts  
its based on the 1925 silent film seven chances which i am sure is very better than this mess  
even though some may think of this as a good date movie  most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back  
besides being a terrible movie  the bachelor is well a terrible movie  
it has nothing worth recommending therefore i really cant recommend this movie  
i did not have a good time and i laughed only three times  
the running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes  
parts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time  
being one of the worst movies of the year  we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies  and if they do they i give up on filmmakers

0	"sometimes i wonder just what the censors are thinking  
take this film   naked killer   among its ingredients are heavy doses of violence  rape sequences  straight and lesbian sex scenes and what our system calls  coarse language   
but what do those intelligent people at the censorship bureau choose to remove in case someone will get offended  
one word  penis  
thats it  
in spite of everything else in the movie the one thing that the censors decide is too much is  penis    
it really restores youre faith in the system  huh  
anyway  thats just a side point  
when naked killer was released in the local independent cinemas around melbourne  it was advertised ad nausuem as a hip  cool  controversial thriller  
what they forgot to mention was that it isnt very good  
the plot involves male cop tinam  simon yam   investigating a series of brutal murders  
while getting a haircut he meets and finds himself attracted to a girl named kitty  chingmy yau   who  after extracting revenge on the man who killed her father  falls in with professional killer sister cindy  svenwara madoka   
realising kitty has potential  cindy decides to train kitty in several unusual and ridiculous ways and gives her a new identity  
however in the course of his investigation tinam  who believed kitty had disappeared   runs into her again  but isnt quite sure if its her  
to complicate matters the actual serial killlers  princess and baby  who a former students of cindy  and have been told to kill their old master and her new student  
from then the action ensues    
all in all  this is not a well done movie  
the script is awful  the direction all over the place  the editing is jerky and confusing and the subtitling is surprisingly poor  
however the are a few stand alone pieces that do entertain  
the shoot out in the car park is almost woolike in adrenaline  
the fight scenes are energetic and i guess it must get a few points for trying something a little different  
let me put this way  if you like action  get something else  if you like strong women in movies  get something else  if you have do decide between this and  black cat  for your hong kong female action  dont get either  
even for curiosity value it just isnt worth it  
lets face it  if ever the was a movie that became popular on its subject alone  this is it

review   quills  is an exploration of the marquis de sade  his madness  his cruelty and his perversion  his obsession with sex in any form  no matter how obscene  
but  quills  also details the marquis determination  to write in spite of the obstacles put in his path  and to propagate his words to the masses  
the extent to which de sade is willing to go to practise his trade is amongst the movies most intriguing elements  as when de sade scribes a story in his own blood  or narrates a tale via of a chain of fellow inmates  cell to cell  
to provide a contrast with the marquis  wright involves him with two very different characters  
one is the abbe  a handsome  charming and kindly man whose desires are stymied by his oath to god  
the abbe lusts for madeleine  but it is the wizened marquis who is able to have her  
and then there is royercollard  a hypocrite who in truth is as sadistic as any of the marquis motley creations

kaufmans direction is fine  and he is able to bring a sense of bizarre humour to the grim proceedings  
the plot itself is rather mundane and plays out unsurprisingly  but this is virtually unimportant

he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18 million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier  which  by the way  is somehow due to schmidt  
and if she refuses  
who knows what hell do to the kid  
  cue sinister laughter  
this movie is so pathetically pitiful that its hard to know where to begin  
the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant  
i cant stress enough how every single element  whether it be a character  the dialogue  a plot  twist   etc   is so damn generic that youll wonder if  anyone  is working behind the scenes  let alone in front of the camera  
basinger is absolutely vacant  
and where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her  
heres someone that spent their time robbing banks  and now as she heads onto the street  were supposed to feel sorry for her  
as she confronts her son  who doesnt even know who she is  are we supposed to break into tears   
especially when neither basinger nor zach english  who plays the kid  has any depth or emotionalradiance whatsoever  
i suppose i should mention val kilmer  
yeah  thats right  hes in it  
quite sadly too  seeing as how i can discuss everything about the movie and never mention his name  
and he got second billing  
to be fair  i will admit that kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j  t  
barker  
unfortunately the script doesnt allow much room for improvement  and when his character is used like bookends  he never shows up in the middle of the film    
we have no time to appreciate what he might have brought to this project  
the real mccoy just cant keep its head above water  and soon   very  soon  sinks into a cliched mess of movie  
the actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer  and the dialogue  particularly schmidts trite dialogue  falls like the niagra  
this is definitely one to avoid  folks  
the real mccoy is anything but

0	"even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material  as this subpar submarine comedy proves  
down periscope stars kelsey  frasier  grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officers  james coburn  plan to get him out of the navy  
like any lame emsemble comedy  the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out  the fat guy who eats all the time  the beautiful woman who doesnt belong there  lauren holly   the secondincommand who does everything by the book  rob schneider   the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out  harry dean stanton  and so on  
then comes the transparent plotline  
first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him  and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard  
after the ship is fixed up come the early drills  where everyone seems completely inept  like the electrician who cant connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone  
finally  and this covers the final hour of the movie  grammer has to lead his men  and holly  to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise  
and he has to be a clever rebel to do it  in scenes that stretch all levels of believability  
first theyre singing  louie louie  like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off  then thirty minutes later  theyre making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off  
the whole while  evil captain coburn is overacting underwater  cursing grammer  as most people watching the movie probably are too   
its all predictable without any original humor to redeem it  
the jokes are right out of  mchales navy  and other cutrate sitcoms of the past  
theres one scene where schneider looks through the ships pantry in disgust  holds one food can up and announces   this expired in 1966   
i yelled back at the screen   so did these jokes   
i watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it  
my mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and  around the start of the second hour  i started writing my will  
the blame cant really be placed on the stars  though  
kelsey grammer is good in this  he just doesnt have anything to work with  
his character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had  welcome aboard  tatooed on his penis  
grammer probably did something even worse  got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about  
same for holley  save the penis part   who is likeable in down periscope just because shes so gorgeous  
as for schneider  whose character is downright annoying   there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas  although hes still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the  snl  ship  
my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy   okay  its police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber    and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster  
judging from the video box  most other movie critics agree with me  
the only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channels jim ferguson  
i guess even jeff craig from  60 second preview   who said tank girl  kicks butt   
without ever seeing it  didnt like this  
"
1	"  the blair witch project  was perhaps one of a kind  a unique film that played completely on its own merit  managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses  
its success made a sequel inevitable  but this is not the sequel  i suspect  anyone much wanted  
after the release of  the blair witch project   tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville  in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch  
locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity  selling twigsculptures  stones and dirt like those in the movie  and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn  shouting   get out of these woods and go home  
there is no goddamned blair witch    
jeff   is one of those people  who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage  
after he got released from the mental institution  he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet  
as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods  on the  blair witch hunt   
among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend  the pregnant tristen  who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called  the blair witch  history or hysteria    and kim  who dresses in black and has some psychic powers  
the last member of the crew is erica  a young beautiful witchwannabe  who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore  saying  the first rule of wicca is  do no harm  because whatever you do will come back to you threefold   
this strange group plunges into the woods  where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience  
on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parrs abandoned house  strange things start happening  
when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain  
after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies  
they are somehow lost in time  as it loops uncontrollably back and forth  
they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality  
the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods   
documentary director joe berlinger   paradice lost   helms  blair witch 2   leaving the creators of the first film  dan myrick and ed sanches  in the background  
the opening scenesthe documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film is a more promising approach  because instead of trying to cover similar ground  it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand  
but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story  that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue  
in a way  this is a typical hollywood sequel  
more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail  
the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated  
of course in these situations  quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values  
from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloodyred forest  with carter burwells   being john malkovich  and  fargo   musical score in the background  you realize that with the exception of its title  this film has absolutely nothing to do with  the blair witch project   
  blair witch    
was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation  
in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection  creating a completely different atmosphere  
with its graceful cinematography  production design and flashy editing  the film has a very polished look  which is impossible to associate with the first installment  
and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times  he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor  
the key is simplicity  
  blair witch project  had a story which was incredibly simple  
that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination  
the film was practically an empty screen  on which we projected our most frightening nightmares  
the effect was incredibly powerful  lasting and entir e everyone  but in a different way  
  book of shadows  feels incredibly controlled and restrict  
here  very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and  clever  that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it  
there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with  
this is simply a less artistic film that doesnt have the talent and originality of its predecessor  
it resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesnt always succeed  
but most importantly  it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie  which doesnt allow it to destroy the original  
in the end  i cant call it a bad effort  
its less artistic  not so scary and less original  but certainly not bad  
its simply different  
in fact  if you havent seen  the blair witch project   you might like this film for what it is  a cross between  the blair witch project  and the  scream  films  
the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting  jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned  and incredible sense of surrealism  
but its a common knowledge and experience that  with a few exceptions  every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making  
to me the story of  the blair witch project  seemed completed  but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that  the book of shadows  is certainly assured  
and its already time to look forward to  blair witch 3

1	"people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels  stories  comic books or movies  
often science fiction aficionados find material  previously labelled as science fiction  to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror  or rather simple technothriller  
in such cases  mistakes are understandable  genre boundaries are never clearly marked  
but  i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic  
such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago  when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff  1983 film directed by philip kaufman  
the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits  
but the right stuff film isnt even fiction  
it was based on the nonfiction book by tom wolfe  covering the early years of american space program  
the plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base  major test site for experimental planes  
the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier  
many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado  
but one quiet pilot  chuck eager  played by sam shaped  succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots  determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records  
ten years later  soviets have launched  sputnik  marking the beginning of the space age  
in order to regain national prestige  us government decides to be the first to send man into space  
best air force  navy and marine pilots are recruited into program  but not yeager  because he lacks college education and desired allamerican image  
in one of critics polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s  
such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufmans film looks quite atypical for its time  
with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s  age when hollywood used to make films larger than life  
but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker  
philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original  memorable movies  
the right stuff was the last of them  swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual  risktaking  artsy  projects  
the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film  
the plot is almost nonexistent and not very coherent  the story  featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes  shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots  embodied in yeager  to new generation of the astronauts  
the film also lacks conventional protagonist  yeager  who also appears in small cameo  remains the true hero of the film  but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives  making this movie into ensemble piece  
that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents  until that specialised only for bit or character roles  
sam shepard is great as yeager  war hero whose greatest achievement  breech of the sound barrier  remained obscured in history books  probably due to his own modesty  
on the surface  he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues  but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases  
shepards performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as cleancut marine  and future politician  john glenn  
young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper  and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom  superbly played by fred ward  
always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and  arguably  first american man in space alan shepard  
kaufman left room for female talents to excel too  barbara hershey  pamela reed  veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots wives  
royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher  but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vicepresident lyndon b  johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch  
great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufmans superb direction  
most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time  
the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert  as virtual unknowns  far away from strict rules and discipline  
everything seems natural yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world  
in that setting  its quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights  
but the times are changing  ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war  and  natural  pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined  conventional pilots  
their entire lives become focus of media frenzy  and their job is subjected to strict rules  meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats  publicityseeking politicians and uncaring scientists  like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun  played by scott beach  only to preserve their most basic human dignity  
this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence  while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity   mercury  astronauts receive fame and fortune  although some of them even before going in the space  
those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufmans superb use of poetic movie language  
editing is great  and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion  the same image would be copied in many latter films   
although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military  which provided authentic locations and period equipment  he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights  
those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space  
another fine contribution of this film is  oscar  awarded musical score by bill conti  i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it  
it is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy  
some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period  
this film is great  and its cult status is well deserved  but there are some minor flaws  
some of the  mercury  astronauts arent fleshed out enough  although being played by fine actors  like lance henriksen   
film also lacks proper closure  
on the other hand  most logical conclusion of the film  landing on the moon  would require this film to be more than six hours long  
also  some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians  who were portrayed as evil monsters  just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagans america  
in some of contemporary interviews  kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible  and in order to do that  he portrayed russians not as they were in real life  but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s  
time has passed  now we dont see astronauts as heroes  
in this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions  those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers  
few young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up  
but this film  sentimental reminder of the times  when future began   perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow  mercury  astronauts footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky  
and even if they decide to stay on earth  they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema

0	"the kids in the hall are an acquired taste  
it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer  
maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies  they would grow into the big screen  
my recommendation is that  unless you are a big fan of the kids  skip the film  
as it is  their firstand most likely onlyattempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv  
a bigbudget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show  
the kids go through the motions  but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so  
and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics  
brain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression  
in typical sketchcomedy tradition  each actor plays several roles  
doctor cooper  kevin mcdonald  and his team create the drug  
then  under pressure from don roritor  mark mckinney   founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals  dr  cooper releases the drug into the marketplace  
the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film  
at about 90 minutes  brain candy still seems long  
the best thing about sketch comedyand the kids are no exceptionis the ability to quickly deliver the laughs  then go on to another quick skit  
but with the additional setup necessary in telling a longer  coherent story  the laughs just dont come fast enough  
strangely  the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv  
the movie makes several attempts at risquenessmostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons charactersbut they seem almost forced  as if they have to live up to a pg rating  
one of the best bits  though  does make use of thompsons naked buttocks  we see him charging into battlegoing to have sex with some guys taking a shower  
in the classic of this genre  monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail  
the kids  unfortunately  are not up to the task  
there are some amusing moments  to be sure  but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one

1	"in enemy at the gates  jude law is a gifted russian sniper made hero by a political officer named danilov  joseph fiennes  who uses him in a propaganda newspaper to raise the hopes of the soldiers and people of stalingrad  
its world war ii  and the russiangerman standoff in town could determine the outcome of things for the motherland  
laws vassili is the russians top pawn to victory  
lots of war stuff happens  
an older  german version of judes character played by ed harris shows up halfway into the proceedings  
hes equally talented  and the two men play a cat and mouse game trying to kill each other  
they constantly switch roles  as the war fades far into the background  
the cast also includes the terrific rachel weisz as a love interest for both vassili and danilov 
the setup is decent  and so are the production values  
boasting a wide range of grimy locales  greasy hair  and tattered costumes  the art direction prospers  
the actors  however  suffer the problem matt damon had in saving private ryan  
either their eyes  teeth  skin  or a combination of other features looked too white and clean  
with dirt and blood all around  the blinding teeth or bright eyes of these actors divert attention from the action  
that said  the players are mostly good in their roles  although i dont think ed harris was really trying  
maybe he realized his role struck a difficult chord in onenotedom  
while the film is technically about snipers  there are far too many predictable sniping scenes  
director jeanjacques annaud expects us to view each tense situation with jude and some cohort in a tight spot as edgy and exciting  but after about the sixth time  in which we realize that jude is not going to die  its relatively pointless  
we get that hes talented  okay  lets move on  
thats the problem with enemy at the gates  it just doesnt know when to stop  
witness the wasted seventeen minutes that could have been spent elsewhere  
reestablishing his title as the most beautiful  and often talented  man on film  jude law carries the movie  
without him  this costly production would have gone into the ground  
the story and acting are of good quality  but theres never a sense of authenticity or reality  
something about this war movie is undeniably modern  and it loses its feeling  
strange enough  the screenplay is based on the true story of a real russian sniper

1	"  no man is an island   one character quotes john donne in apt pupil  effectively summarizing the movies themes  
while hardly a great film  singers ambitious adaptation of kings short story  is challenging nonetheless  perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it  
apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses  
1984  wonderbred high school honours student todd bowden  renfro  conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander  a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again  
bowden suspects arthur denker  mckellan   the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby  is actually a pseudonymous dussandermuch research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todds theory  
bowden strikes a deal with dussander  in exchange for not revealing his identity  dussander must satisfy bowdens intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view  
the stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams  but like a bystander at a traffic accident  todds desire for gory details overrides his repulsion  
bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii  
marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander  it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his  student   among other things  
bowden  who has taken on very hateful qualities  he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook   engages the veteran in an endless game of oneupmanship  
dussander stands to lose his freedom  and bowden his credibilityin effect  his postsecondary school future  
all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable  and unsettling  conclusion  one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source materials excessive climax  
singer has yet to get keyser s  ze out of his system  
his the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence  verbals tics and todds goldenboy reputation are plausible ruses   they showcase morally bankrupt antiheroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals  
apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects  a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcomethere was no way you could see the ending coming  as it was all a hoodwink  anyway  
thankfully  singer has gotten most of the usual suspects filmschoolish geek theatrics out of his system  
some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected andor obvious  the dream sequences were extraneous   but the majority of the film is subduedand singers handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murdererintraining  
mckellans and renfros performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film  while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellans finelytuned realization  id like to single out renfros daring work  
he isnt afraid to play someone largely unappealing and coldhearted  he strips his character of vanity  something many of his peers wouldnt do  
  can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylorthomas in the same role   
renfro was recently charged with possession of cocainei hope he doesnt continue down that path  because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him  
as guidance counsellor edward french   friend  schwimmer also deserves mention  
he wants to be the parent to todd that todds own welltodo folks are not  todd  like most modern kidsand onlychildrenhas mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger   and his sincerity makes the apt pupils blackeningheart even more apparent  
but one of the films ultimate questions  are we born evil or do we learn evil   might be answered in french  whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous  
no man is an island  indeedwe all have the capacity to make the  right  or the  wrong  choices  
schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible  
october  1998 
  the excellent collection kings stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil  but the shawshank redemption  originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption  and stand by me  originally titled the body

1	"it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child  whether that may be in life or in death  
after having said that  i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well  
one gets that choking sensation in the throat  because of grief  when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake  or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement  
there is no ocean  no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another  ordinary people  
in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing  not that this literally happened in the movie   
so what are the lessons learnt  1  
dont take your children to class reunions  
2  dont leave them alone in the lobby  not even for a second  
michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highlystrung wife and mother  a trend that started with  a thousand acres and  one fine day  
my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie  so much so that when she has a nervous break down  the veins on her temples bulge impressively  
whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance  playing a lesbian cop  with a name that makes one want to reach for a lollipop  
lastly  who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie  my grandmother comes to mind

0	"who knew that in 16 years eddie murphy  who made such a brash  raucous bigscreen splash in 48hrs    
would become    
cuddly  
the disconcerting trend begun in this summers cutesy  largely laughfree doctordolittle continues with this earnesttoafault dramedy  
although he is topbilled  here murphy is merely support for jeff goldblum  who plays ricky hayman  the programming director at a home shopping network  
sales are way down  and rickys job hangs by a thread until he meets g  murphy   a mysterious spiritual guru whom a desperate ricky puts on the air  
while sales skyrocket and g becomes an overnight sensation  the reinvigorated rickys greed grows  endangering his budding romance with a goodhearted media research consultant  kelly preston   
writer tom schulman has some promising ideas  satirizing home shopping and infomercials and the nature of instant celebrity  
but these ideas would have more bite if stephen herek had invested any energy into the direction of the film  
the sluggishly paced holyman is not only slow and overlong  113 minutes   but an unfunny bore  and murphy can do little to juice up the proceedings  cleansed of both the attitude and comic sensibility that made him a star  g is  for the most part  a straight man   he is a curiously lifeless presence  
goldblum is actually quite good  but its hard for the audience to sustain much interest in his character and spiritual journey when the director doesnt seem to be much interested  either  
"
1	"ive never been a huge fan of jeff bridges  but i loved him in the big lebowski  
the part of jeff  the dude  lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind  and the fit is perfect  
the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles  a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians  
hes enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes  
after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy  but not before they urinate on his rug  
the dude assumes that these  collection agents  were after another jeff lebowski  a famous millionaire who also lives in l  a  so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug  
the millionaire refuses  but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped  
he wants the dude to act as gobetween for the kidnapers  
dude and his friend walter  john goodman  take on the task  and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers  millionaires  high schoolers  nihilists  artists  pornographers  thugs  and league bowlers  
comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres  so take my recommendation as you will  for me  the big lebowski is very funny  
it is an incredibly successful comedy  the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films  
not only are the two leads  bridges and goodman  funny separately and together  but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure  
all the characters end up as the butt of jokes  but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived  
each person may be a comic caricature  but there is always a respectful selfacceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension  
the characters are firmly established  and they never change their behavior for a quick  cheap laugh  
its not what they do thats funny  its who they are  which is why the acting is so important  and so successful  in this movie  
worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus  thats jeezus  not haysoos   the greaser bowler whos in a lusty marriage with the game  julianne moore as the postpostfeminist artist whose work has been described as  vaginal   steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter  and sam elliott as the rambling  longwinded narrator  
aside from the performances  what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue  
people lose trains of thought  they interrupt  they boast  they repeat themselves  they repeat their friends    
they sound natural  
taken with fargo  the coen brothers last film  it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers  
ethan coen is not just good at directing actors  hes also good at technical directing  
he and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film  
perhaps  beautiful  is the wrong word  nihilists  carpetpissers and thugs are not objects of beauty  
but the bowling photography and a series of vikingbowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed  as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film  
all around  the big lebowski is great  solid comedy  
outstanding acting  writing  direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success

1	"if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child  would you do it  
  gattaca  is a film which presents a future where society has answered  yes  to this question  but then ponders if this was actually the right decision  
  gattaca  came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature  the lovable dolly the sheep  and with this in mind  the film only becomes more frightening  
the way the realm of genetics is heading  it may only take a couple decades until the future  gattaca  presents becomes true  
contrary to the misleading trailers   gattaca  is not a scifi thriller  in the way that theres lots of murder  hitchcockian suspense  and chase scenes  
this is a quiet  sad film about intelligent theories  
in fact  the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley  the latter whos novel  brave new world  featured genetically engineered children   
its a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia  which is exactly what  gattaca  presents    and the main reason i dug it so much  
the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman  ethan hawke   a man with high hopes but a 90 chance of heart problems  and a prospected life span of around 30 years  
as a child  he was put down because of the threats of genetics  while his younger genetically perfect brother  anton  loren dean   was promised whatever his heart desired  
vincent yearns to be an astronaut  but when he gets a job at a giant space company  its as a janitor  ernest borgnine plays his boss    
but one day  he finds out that its probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist  or something   german   wings   tony shalhoub  who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in 97   men in black    a life less ordinary       whos client is a genetically perfect man  jerome morrow  jude law   who has unfortunately been crippled  
fortunately  though  theres no record of the accident  and hes willing to give someone else his life  
since vincent looks a bit like him    
after a couple alterations  some minor  some really major   he has donned the life of jerome  and is doing his job  
there  he meets a genetically imperfect woman  irene  uma thurman  whos genetically perfect in real life anyway  hee hee   and the two begin a kind of relationship  albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a mans stats are  
however  a murder of a highlevel worker at his office is killed  and one of vincentjeromes eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semiwily inspector  hugo   alan arkin   and none other than vincents long lost brother  anton  who hasnt seen him since they were teenagers  
we know vincentjerome didnt do it  but with his older picture being posted everywhere  not only vincentjeromes in trouble  but also the real jerome  whos as much in it as he is  
however  there isnt many big suspense set pieces  which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in  the film would lose its message and descend into just being a scifi thriller a la william gibson  
the suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin  
while there are several scenes which are pretty frightening  there are no big distractions from the point of the film  much to the dismay of commercial audiences  
what is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created  
irene has no real spunk in her life  and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people  
and the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man  claiming that his accident was really no accident  
what jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that  and the ending is shocking as its a definite work of dystopian propaganda  but doesnt have the down ending of other works of this kind  
the production design of this film is probably the best ive seen this year  its stunning  very pleasing to the eye  but still very cold  
since genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement  the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity  and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery  
and the sequence of all the highlevel workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliamesque feel to it  showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombielike life  
the ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy  
the acting from everyone is great  with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance  and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway  interesting pointless fact  uma and ethan started dating after this film  and currently she is pregnant with his child   
but the best performance belongs to jude law  who steals every scene hes in  and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden  
i think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child  but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something im not sure of  
  gattaca  warns us not to go any farther  chiefly because well create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy  and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are  
and when i see a possible future featuring a 12fingered piano player  well folks  that just creeps me out

1	"with the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately  what with that whole clinton thing going on  you know  100 million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern  oh  please  government  waste my taxes just a bit more  would you    
its about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement  
with this and  crimson tide   hes created two successfully chilly films that are interesting  exciting  even pretty smart  but never totally riveting as cinema  and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying  and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart  
that film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them  and was appropriately scary and all  but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant  
  enemy of the state  is the same way  its engrossing for its entire running time  and its scary the way that it shows a mans decent into kafkaism  but its too technical  
its too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be  
it casts will smith  one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because hes charming and witty and never uninteresting  and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person  
i hate to do this  but last years film  the game  got it damn perfect  it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being  a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life  and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened  
the result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling  but also the best mindfuck of the entire year  
not that i want every kafkaesque film to be  the game   this years  the spanish prisoner  succeeds with less thrills and chills   but it should be an example of what works and what doesnt  
will smiths character is  frankly  too perfect  at least too movie perfect  
he had an affair with another woman  lisa bonet  ha ha   but his relationship with his wife  regina king  is basically fine regardless  
he has a kid  and hes raking in money as a lawyer  albeit a very good and reasonably moral one  
so he generally doesnt have any real problems as a human being  and is therefore boring    except that he is played by will smith  who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering  id4    men in black  territory  
hes a good dramatic actor  just see the first half hour of  six degrees of separation  for proof of this  not that he isnt great the whole time   and here  he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character  which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities  
smith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance  extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world  under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control  when he is passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party  a nature observer played by  uh  jason lee   
the government wants the disk  and is prepared to destroy his life to get it  
as smiths plight is dramatized  we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him  sitting in vans disguised as other businesses  staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet  
these guys  played by jack black  jamie kennedy  and seth green  are the most interesting part of this film because theyre  well  fascinating  theyre doing their jobs  which are evil  but the film doesnt view them as such  and they almost become our friends  
we like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesnt automatically judge them as the villains  
theyre also scary because we get the idea that theyre not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world  
its as if theyre obsessed with their jobs  not because theyre evil  but because  hey  its a fun job  and no one else can do it like them  
unfortunately  this also backfires a bit on the film  instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that  the game  was  you see everything  and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on  
sure  youre chilled  but youre not exacty freaked out by whats going on  
but what do you expect from tony scott  the man who never met a fivesecond piece of film he ever liked  
hes a notbad director because  hell  he is always interesting to watch  if not occasionally moronic  exhibit a   days of thunder    but the reason hes not great is because hes too technical and calculated  
his shots are perfectly executed  and leave nothing to the imagination  and theyre always making sure youre paying attention  
this is incredibly annoying  and it reduces  enemy of the state  to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths  but still manage to entertain without any real problems  
despite never actually becoming great  its never actually boring and its always intriguing  
watching the government setup smith is endlessly fascinating  and since we care about smiths likeable protagonist  we are setup for a good two hours worth of tom clancyesque entertainment  
add the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film  everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos   and youve got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smiths plight without a minutes worth of boredom

1	"call me crazy  but i dont see saving private ryan as the film of the summer  
a good movie  yes  with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare  
an utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielbergs best work  no  
personally  if i was spielberg  i wouldnt go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindlers list and the indiana jones movies  
im guessing steve has a thing for nazis  i really wouldnt be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastikawearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie  
all lofty pretenses aside  saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick  
the difference is  its easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacons chest while blood spurts like crazy  but its damn hard to sit and eat reeses pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield  
and believe me  theres plenty of it  
a 30minute sequence at the beginning of the movie has an army captain  tom hanks  and his soldiers landing at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are already under fire  
lives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on  and all the young men in the audience find themselves never  ever wanting to be drafted  
cut to some bureaucratic defense office  where a hundred women pound out sympathy form letters to the families of the casualties  
one woman happens upon an interesting detail  three brothers in different platoons were killed in combat  and their mother is getting the telegram today  
i guess its an interesting conversation piece to everyone but the mother  so the army chief  harve presnell  sends hanks on what is essentially a public relations mission  to find the fourth ryan brother and send him home  
that way  the army saves the postage on yet another telegram to mrs  ryan  
one good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed to rescue ryan know its a mission designed to make the army look good  
they question the worth of risking eight soldiers lives to save one  and hanks character admits he doesnt give a damn about ryan  hes just following orders  
if this was a john wayne movie  things would be different  
thered be a phony   lets go get that boy  gosh darn it   
attitude that would sugarcoat the reality of war  
by doing things this way  spielberg admits the instincts of self preservation and complacency that every normal person has  
it makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosteronedriven stallone movie mission  
the movies pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by quiet scenes of semiintrospective conversation among the soldiers  
hanks is painted first as a nailstough army man careful to hide his true self from the other men  
its not that way for long  
edward burns  the guy you get for your movie when ben affleck isnt available  is the impulsive one  
jeremy davies plays the translator who is seeing combat for the first time  and so on  
none of the characters are fascinating or natural born heroes  but was spielbergs obvious intention  
i wondered when i heard saving private ryan was three hours long  how were they going to fill three hours time searching for one person and still make it interesting  
there are a few false starts  hanks finds one private ryan in ted dansons company  apparently  danson joined the army after  ink  was canceled   and breaks the bad news before learning its the wrong ryan  
and of course the movies far from over when hanks does locate ryan  matt damon  the other guy you get when affleck isnt available   
thats when the movie turns into more of a conventional war flick  although body parts and limbs still fly like never before  
saving private ryan is worth your time  but its definitely no schindlers list  
the battle scenes are intense and realistic  but some of the attempts at sincere emotion arent  
the movies bookends are particularly cheesy and out of place  when an old private ryan goes to the cemetary with his family and bawls his eyes out  whining   tell me ive led a good life  
tell me im a good man   
spielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of thought that any threehour movie about the past should be framed by a selfcontained prologue and epilogue that takes place in the present  
much more effective are subtler scenes  like the one where several of hanks men are rifling thrugh a bag of dogtags from dead soldiers  and they make light of what theyre doing by pretending theyre playing poker  
this while an airborne division marches by  their eyes full of that mound of dogtags  
by not explicitly pointing out that it symbolizes the random poker game that life and death can be in war  the audience gets the message  
and even if its not a classic  saving private ryan is definitely one of the better war movies out there

1	"  the endurance  shackletons legendary antarctic expedition  
in 1914  as the great war descended upon europe  sir ernest shackleton began his third expedition to antarctica  this time to be the first to cross the icebound continent on foot  
28 men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years  
director george butler  using film footage and photographs from the historic journey  tells their remarkable story in  the endurance  shackletons legendary antarctic expedition   
the expedition started out as a merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse  on foot  the vast wasteland of antarctica  
as the intrepid ship and crew entered the weddell sea  the entry to the cold  cruel continent  they did not plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of land  
for months the ice thickened and compressed until the ship was crushed  stranding the men on the flow  propelling them away from their goal and  eventually  into their lifeboats for safety  
shackleton  faced with a desolate situation  made the decision to lead the three tiny boats to the relative safety of uninhabited elephant island  
once on this  safe  haven  shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew and returning them to civilization  
he and five of his men leave the island in an open boat to make the 800 mile journey on the worlds roughest sea to get help from the nearest inhabited island of south georgia  
miraculously  the six land  after 17 days at sea  on the uninhabited side of the target island and are forced to trek across treacherous  snow covered mountains  covering 22 miles in just 36 hours  
this ordeal is followed by several attempts by shackleton to get back to elephant island to rescue the remaining crewmen  
in the end  he is successful and everyone made it back home alive  only to be swallowed up by the ravages of the war  
the title of this fascinating documentary   the endurance   is more than just the name of ship that carried the crew of brave men to the edge of the world  
it is also the description of the stamina and ability of every one of the men who survived 19months of the toughest  most grueling conditions on the face of the earth  
the name of the film is a tribute to every member of the crew and to the ship that sheltered them for many month of frigid antarctic weather  
it also describes the focused mental state of shackleton who never gave up on himself or his men  
with astonishing foresight  shackleton brought australian cinematographer and photographer frank hurley along on the journey  
the filmed footage and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men  day to day life  the affection all felt for their loyal sled dogs  the slow destruction of the endurance and the preparations to get off of the pack ice flow  
after the sinking of the ship  the remaining film stock  with the exception of a still camera and three rolls of film  had to be discarded so the continuing chronicle of the incredible journey gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods on  
considering hurley was using relatively primitive photo technology in one of the worlds harshest environments and captured so much on film is a feat unto itself  
  hurley created his own account of the shackleton expedition in his 1919 documentary   south   an interesting companion piece for  the endurance   
if shackletons original idea  document his trek across the frigid southern continent  had been successful  it would have been considered a super human feat  
as you watch the story of  the endurance  unfold  you realize that the disastrous obstacles the sir ernest and his men faced and overcame were even greater accomplishments than the first intent  
  shackletons amazing 800mile journey in an open boat is fodder for a rousing adventure story all by itself   
there are a couple of minor nitpicks with this fine work  though  
actor liam neeson narrates the story  but his voice is too soft spoken and lilting for the dramatic tale  
the nature of the ordeal also concentrates most of the visual material  both film and photo  in the documentarys first half  
as the crews adventure takes more drastic paths  hurley had less and less film stock available to chronicle the awesome events  
helmer butler and his team fill in the blanks  but the treasure of  the endurance   its film footage  is mostly relegated to the early months of the expedition  
i cant think of a truelife adventure that shows  better  the triumph of man over seemingly insurmountable odds  
  the endurance   based on caroline alexanders book  is an eyeopening documentary that goes where few men have gone before and  even more remarkably  all 28 survivors lived to tell about it  
i give it a b

1	"those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugos novel les miserables  
i dont know if a lot of people have  though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel  
i havent even seen that  
going into this film  i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters  i even expected the film to be a musical   
walking away from it  im kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material  
writerdirector bille augusts film version is a straightforward  beautifully told film  
liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean  in the beginning  he has just been released from a 19year prison sentence  
he is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior  
the priests words of wisdom influence him  and he makes a vow to change himself  
nine years later  we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo  nobody knows his real name  and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago  
conflicts arise when inspector javert  geoffrey rush  is assigned to vigo  
valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him  and javert remembers jean to be a convict  
javert is hellbent on upholding the law  and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice  
along the way  valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman  fantine  uma thurman   and vows to take care of her daughter  cosette  played later by claire danes   
les miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture  
the production design by anna asp is authentic and vast  and the sets dont look like sets  they look like real towns and villages   gabriella pescuccis costumes are noticeably spectacular  
basil poledouris soundtrack is thick and usually wellplaced  though it does get a bit heavy at times   
many scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality  such as the climax  which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening  
augusts keeps the story simple  which i hear is a good thing  since the novel is so complex  and easy to follow  
he manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately  
i was also impressed that he didnt go overboard with flash and style  which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days  such as baz luhrmanns vicious tragedy william shakespeares romeo  juliet   
this film feels solid and whole  and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested  
liam neeson is terrific in the main role  neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well  and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective  
thurman  in her small role  is very good  and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very nonglamorous role such as this one  
rush is absolutely incredible as javert  i dont remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here  he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances  and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense  
i cant be as charitable for danes  however  though i know she is a talented actress  here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit  
les miserables is  as ive said  a solid  intelligent motion picture  
my only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy  and perhaps too staged  
each scene is grand and huge  and exploding with poledouris score  but i didnt always want them to be  
for the most part  les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture  
its a good movie  and tells its story well  but august tends to handfeed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle  
however  in a film this exciting and wellproduced  a few minor flaws are easily overlooked

0	"if only austin powers  the spy who shagged me had been just half as original  zany  silly and totally enjoyable as its predecessor  it would have easily been one of this summers biggest pleasures  
if only  
in fact  the spy who shagged me is the exact opposite of the original  instead of refreshing the audience with one clever parody after another  the filmmakers bombard us with usedup  tired jokes taken directly from the first one  
take the scene where austin powers  again played by mike myers  but with only a fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously  confronts a henchmen on the side of a cliff  
after being pushed off the ravine  the bad guy is of course assumed dead  
but suddenly  we hear a pleading voice coming from down below  hes only injured  
a similar scene played very well in the original international man of mystery  but here i was insulted by it  
did the filmmakers really believe the audience would laugh at a ripoff  
apparently i overestimated the intelligence of the average moviegoer  considering that the film has pulled in over 200 million in domestic theatrical grosses alone  
do i hear the sound of a franchise heading our way  
having said that  though  i still cannot deny the film its merits  
the basic plot was delightfully silly enough to sustain my interest somewhat  dr  evil  mike myers  in the second of his three roles   having constructed a time machine  goes back to the year 1969 in an attempt to snatch austin powers  mojo   dont you just love that word   
whilst he is cryogenically frozen  
when austin gets wind of this  after a great intro explaining the absence of elizabeth hurleys vanessa kensington   he too travels back in time to reclaim his sexual drive  accompanied by the hottotrot felicity shagwell  played by heather graham  
this sounds stupid  i know  but in the movie it starts to make some kind of weird  offthewall sense  and it worked for me  
then theres minime  verne troyer   a    
petite clone of myers dr  evil  exactly 18 in size  
troyers persona alone gains the film an extra halfstar  contributing to one particularly hilarious scene where he attempts to nibble on his own minimr  
bigglesworth  
just try to ignore the fact that  at 28  he would make dr  evils height rise to just over 21 feet  
no matter  
however  there are only about four hearty laughs throughout the entire hour and a half  the most notable being the now infamous tent scene   and that just isnt enough to warrant even a minor recommendation  
if there is in fact an  austin powers 3   they should just kill off secret agent powers and put the emphasis on dr  evil and minime  
unconventional  yes  but theres no denying that itd make for a better movie

0	"i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films  
when done right  with at least slightly evident restraint  they can be engaging  sweeping  appealing  
but its a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle  a hollow  boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers  the ones willing to buy into ephrons whiny views of life and romance  
tom hanks and meg ryan  two of hollywoods most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed  repectively  
baldwins wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son  jonah  seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse  
jonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems  
sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show  but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out  
ephron has him do this so that annie reed  meg ryan  can hear it  
annie is a happy woman  
she is engaged to walter  an allergyprone working man and seems to be perfectly content  
but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show  she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it  
five years after this movie hit theaters  hanks  ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better  although still subpar romantic comedy youve got mail  which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet  
at least that movie had a sense of spontaneity  
here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five  
the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory  
sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers  from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie odonnell  
but none of them can save the film from being a bore  
its characters are dull and empty  its script isnt funny or particularly charming  
the script has a fundamental problem  annie gives up  for little reason  her life with walter to pursue  sleepless in seattle   whom she has never even seen  
its the kind of life decision that real people dont make  and its a major  unforgivable plausibility sacrifice  
in essence  this movies purpose is to head towards a goal that shouldnt even exist  
its a ten minute short film with ninetyfive minutes of filler  
if you were to show me sleepless in seattle and i didnt have to review it  you could just call me  asleep in philadelphia

0	"american pie 2 is filled with laughs  
but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater  
im no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy  
but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment  not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself  
what separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart  
of the original  i noted it was  a warm  pleasant outing about the travails of growing up   
well  the quartet of chums  jim  jason biggs   oz  chris klein   kevin  thomas ian nicholas  and finch  eddie kaye thomas   have grown up  
at least they are a year older  but dont seem any wiser  
fresh from their first year of college the quartet  along with the obnoxious stifler  seann william scott   rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score  
as usual nothing goes right until the last reel  
but what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women  
and american pie 2 is rather degrading to women  
for the most part  they are not shown as individuals  
they are nothing more than potential recipients of overactive  raging hormones  
it is telling that the most normal couple  oz and heather  mena suvari  spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex  shes overseas on an exchange student program  
despite having been to college  jim is still klutzy and awkward  unsure of himself around the opposite sex  
most of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him  including a painful episode involving an instant gluelike substance  
also uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates  whom the boys suspect of being lesbians  
it is offensive and plays upon outdated  adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs  
the first film  despite some raunchy moments  had an innocent charm to it  
the sequel is more cynical  
it knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them  the many mentions of finchs encounter with stiflers mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levys return as jims wellmeaning  tryingtobehip dad  
the only performer who is actually given some new  fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle  the band geek from the original  
in the sequel  she imbues her character with vulnerability  wisdom and maturity  
american pie 2 is a presold commodity that will earn several million at the box office  
it is a shame  though  that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz  who also penned the original  could not have set his sights higher  
american pie 2 is funny  but its still a comedown as well as a letdown

1	"taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking  go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers  
the story centres around a group of people  who include brit simon  askew   and checkout girls claire  holmes  and ronna  polley  and the misadventures that they get into  split into three chapters  
everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers  
although qts touch is evident in nearly every frame  go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride  
liman  who also photographed the film  has a deft touch with the camera  and the film looks good  
the film also seems to have benefited from a budget  with the nightclub scenes in particular looking pretty good  
theres a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk  
the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life  
holmes  one of the dawsons creek cast  a show im not particularly fond of  displays much talent here  and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature  
askew is slightly successful  being rather obnoxious  
no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him  but instead of funny annoying hes just annoying  
he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters  but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it  
the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl  her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining  
also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer  who gives an nice evil performance  
the script  written john august  is sharp and witty  with good dialogue and some funny jokes  
it starts off rather slow however  but in about twenty minutes the script has found its footing and just keeps getting better  
the stories are largely satisfying  although occasionally theres too much attention on one detail but not on another  
also  some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky  
still  the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it  
it could of tried a little harder in some parts however  and these parts lag  
because this is a genxer movie  the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany  and gos one is pretty decent  
unlike other genxers movies  go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue  which is a plus  
go is a very easy movie to absorb into  and the audience really starts feeling for these characters  
thankfully  they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics  like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you   
they are who they are and they stay that way  
go is great fun  and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers  
ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things  and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride  
erm  go to go  i guess

0	"saw an advanced screening of the movie sniper last night  and i have to say i wasnt too impressed  
this film is about an expert marine sniper  played by tom berenger  who is teamed with a hotshotyoungnoexperienceneverkilledaman new partner to take out some drugkingpins and military strong men in panama  
sound cliche  
thats only the beginning  
billy zane  memphis belle  played the rookie  and never seemed to get a handle on his character  
he was so contrary and pigheaded in the beginning  you just wanted to smack him  
then he goes  crazy  from the pressure  but seems to immediately snap out of it  
im not sure if the blame should lie with the directing  editing  scriptwriting  or acting    
but it didnt all come together  
i think berenger is a pretty good actor  and he looked great in the part  covered in camo  face painted  stalking through the jungle with his highpower rifle    
but once again  his character was given some pretty bad dialogue  and didnt react too logically to many of the situations  
there was very little logical development in these characters  
my biggest problem with this film was its tendency to put these two snipers in as  many  inchesfromdeath situations as possible  
they began to resemble g  i  joes  the greatest american hero  
and of course their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to get them out of far too many close calls  
now a lot of movies are stamped out of this mold  in fact thats what made die hard so much fun  the superhero avenger type  
so some will enjoy the action hero heroics  but i didnt think it fit with the nice tension that was built up in the earlier scenes  and the  real life  feel of covert operations in panama  
a word must be said on the camera work  much of it was very nice  
the jungles of panama  or their standins in this case  formed a very picturesque background    
and the drama of speeding bullets was captured using some nice trick photography  
many have seen the slowed down  bulletcam  following the projectile to its target  
this was used well in the beginning to show the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moment of the kill  
it was dramatic when used in flashback    but 
it seems the director liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots  pardon the pun  into the real time action    then 
it just seemed silly  
all in all  not a real dog  there is some nice action  good atmosphere  and pretty photography  
but the plot is pretty lame  the acting didnt form a cohesive whole  and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics

1	"in 1994  an insiders look at a scandalridden run for the democratic presidential nomination  closely based on clintons 1992 campaign  was written anonymously  former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship   
now  the book  primary colors  has been made into a movie  directed by mike nichols  and  in light of recent presidential scandals  seems to be more relevant than ever  
but the film is more than a diatribe against  or a paean in praise of  the president  
it is a fascinating look at the political machinery  and the ethical quagmire  that surround modern politics  
jack stanton  john travolta  is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination  
he is charismatic  but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign  and strains his relationship with his wife  susan  emma thompson   
the film is told from the point of view of henry burton  adrian lester   grandson of a civil rights leader  who is swept away by stantons ideals and helps to organize the campaign  
he joins political strategist richard jemmons  billy bob thornton  looking an awful lot like james carville   and campaign advisor daisy green  maura tierney   
governor stantons past repeatedly pops up to haunt him  a fact that his chief rival  lawrence harris  kevin cooney   consistently uses to his advantage  
to help clean up the stanton campaign  jack and susan bring in an old friend  libby  the dustbuster  holden  kathy bates   
the acting throughout primary colors is superb  
it would be worth seeing the movie for bates wild performance alone  
she enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance  
travolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton  although his accent does stray a little  
emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who cant let anything show that might hurt the presidential run  
the problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other  or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom  
primary colors treads lightly on this issue  
though stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat  and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans  the movie touches on few actual political issues  
in fact  most of the  bad guys  are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house  
rather than issues  the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control  
although the film strays into some obviously nonclinton territory  it is difficult to completely separate it from reality  particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the presidents current troubles   
primary colors chief problem is its length  
it runs about 15 minutes too long  
there are some scenes which could have easily been cut  
for example  midway through the film  the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists  
the scenes only apparent purpose is to establish stantons character  which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film  
the extra length isnt long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying  but it mars an otherwise excellent film  
republicans  democrats  and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors  
its a funny  and at some times shocking  look at the modern political process

1	"i can sum up first strike in one word  awesome  
never in my life have i seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan  
for the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts in his every movie hes ever appeared in  he should be awarded greatly  
the same tom and jerry formula that was used to make chans rumble in the bronx and supercop so entertaining can be found here as well  
however  first strike was probably the most exciting out of the three  for the simple reason that practice makes perfect  
his last two movies were almost like practice and this one was great  
like rumble  this film is about the mafia  the former kgb  
now chan must do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of the ukraine against a group of very large bad men  
the trailer for the film sums it up quite well  
first strike is actionpacked  but the fight scenes are so fast and furious  they almost have a witty  italianlike humor to them  
jackie chan is a regular comedian  
well  hes no eddie murphy  but he can really crack you up  
for example  he is hanging off a roof and he humorously taunts his foes to come and get him  as he claims to be the korean 007  thats secret agent james bond   
even the plot to this film improved above the others  as a sortof twisted nuclearweapon smuggling deal is botched and jackie takes the blame  
but never fear  as the chinese mafia aids him in uncovering the truth behind the incident  
with some of the most highflying stunts and sidesplitting comedy  first strike is a surefire hit thats guaranteed to draw some major  worldwide attention

1	"its been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller  where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters  but its been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually  shock  cared for the characters  not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles  flaws  and strengths to emerge so radiantly  
id saw that its been at least a couple decades  even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers  though im hardly comparing  a simple plan  to  say   rear window  or  strangers on a train   
yet its almost as good  
its simple  yet strangely complex  and astonishingly rewarding  because instead of moving from plot point to plot point  and merely laying out theymightbecaught overtones  it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to  all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral  
elegantly directed by sam raimi  yes  the same    a simple plan  concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright  moderately financially stable working man  bill paxton   his dimwitted brother  billy bob thornton   and his drinking buddy  brent briscoe   
without anyone around  and the possibility that no one would come looking for it  the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes  they will keep it  but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking  and so they generally dont flaunt anything they dont want to flaunt  theyll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton  
the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse  a  they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities  b  they could try to fight off the rightful owners  who are either villainous or just  or c  they could fight amongst themselves  
  a simple plan   though borrows a little from each of these  
a little tiff with the cops here  a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent  a chilling gary cole  there   and a bit of inside feuding over here  
but  as austin powers would say  thats not necessarily its bag  baby   
what i most admired about this film  and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that its successfully able to have its cake and eat it too  
it effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches  like the ones mentioned above  but at the same time  it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag  
so while steps are taken to neatly cover things up  and these subsequent steps go miserably awry  the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to  they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity  
in one early scene  paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesnt look like it was all stolen  not a bad idea   when thornton screws up  as he does continuously throughout the movie   and paxton has to do some major coveringup  read  homicide   
instead of a quick murder and immeadiate handswashing  raimi shows a lengthy  painful shot from a lowangle onto paxtons face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion  
theres a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder hes committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective  but the previous shot is even better  more morally complex and more gutwrenching  
in short  probably the best piece of direction raimis ever done  demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results  for further proof  watch  persona  s  sex scene  and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergmans ever done   
but the film hardly stops here  it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof  
yet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story  
when the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical  with aid from his pregnant wife  played by bridget fonda  a pal to raimi   he does  and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights  
theres at least two grand shootouts  and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history  and when they arrive  they dont come with masochistic delight but with cringeinducing horror  
during the one  i was actually sinking into my chair  with the mantra  they cant do this  can they   
streeming through my head  
in fact  this film  which is getting many comparisons to the coens superior  but forget about it  fargo   has many similar moments of manic insanity  attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what  in other hands  would be overthetop distractedness  imagine  i suppose  robert rodriguez directing this    then 
again  after seeing the  evil dead  films  id hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off  although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed  raimi  moments  a rifleshot notwithstanding   
instead  raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch  easily letting the story and characters coexist  while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out  like some offbeat comic touches  
most particularly  billy bob thorntons character  jacob  is a brilliant creation  
his dimwittedness is often hilarious  for most of the film  every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter   but theres authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that were not totally laughing at him  
the chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of fullcondescension because thornton is so damn real  
jacobs a multidimensional character  and while being stupid  we see that as not so much a flaw  but a strength to his character  his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system  primarily towards the middle where his bud and coconspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money  
the final third of the film spends much time with him  and many of the touches upon his character  not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b  smith  adapting his own book  by the way  are just great  
i particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend  told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to nearsweetness and further strength of his saddened character  
thornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance  by far the best performance hes ever given and further proof that hes the best character actor in contemporary cinema  if you dont believe me  go back and watch his wonderful performance in  primary colors   a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadnt been in the same year  because hes easily able to slip into a character  and make him completely and utterly believable  
he brings so much weight to the film that  as it is with most character actors  its difficult picturing anyone else in the role  
the rest of the cast is great too  from paxtons declining working man to chelcie ross amiable town sheriff  
even fonda shows off her talents nicely  
and if i had any complaints about the film  its that the plot is almost too simplistic  and that at times  it seems too much like an exercise  like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved  
and the occasional narration is  as it usually is  annoying  narration should be used with extreme caution  especially when youre trying to set things up andor express emotions  didnt raimi watch the first murder scene    
and  the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie  the ending is basically amiss  
i wont reveal it  but its way too cruel and too much of an outsider setup  as if the appearance of a plane wasnt already too much of that anyway  
for a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved  this is the wrong ending  
imagine a charactercontrolled ending  otherwise  its like if in  crime and punishment  if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing    not that im at all comparing  a simple plan  to dostoevsky  
the ending does work  despite my protestations  but to me  there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it  but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it  then just ignore me and go about your day  
but despite my mere claims  make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout  and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured  not because of any kind of gore factor  which is  thankfully for this  very minimal   but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that ive frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile  
at least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece

0	"this is the last carry on film with its almost intact regular cast and it is the swansong of hattie jacques and sid james  
dick turpin  sid james  and his gang which includes harriettharry  barbara windsor  and tom  doc  scholl  peter butterworth   terrorise the countryside by staging highway robberies   stand and deliver   
owing to the increased occurrence of turpins robberies  captain desmond fancey of the bow street runners  kenneth williams  and his sidekick sergeant jock strapp  jack douglas  visit turpins area of influence to bring him to justice  
they are under the express orders of sir roger daley  bernard bresslaw   
their intellect does not count for much and when they increasingly become suspicious of reverend flasher aka dick turpin  sid james   whom they confided in earlier  they still cannot believe that the rector has any part in these robberies  
however  once they catch harriett and put her in jail  and sir roger daley takes complete charge  it seems that there is no hope for dick turpin  
then again  sir roger has assigned the dimwits fancey and jock strapp aswell as the old dithering constable  kenneth connor  to keep an eye on their prisoner  
there is no doubt that this is a sid james carry on movie  
he excels in double roles  as in carry on dont lose your head  and his performance as flasher and turpin is hilarious  
barbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang  and hattie jacques small but effective role as the rectors housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection  
jack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying onscreen persona and kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part  
peter butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as tom  and bernard bresslaws character appears only briefly in the film  
the only notable performance from the support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree  who is travelling around the country escorting her starlets the birds of paradise and sporting a fake french accent  
when her girls and her are robbed by turpin  she is determined to catch him and helps the reverend to find the culprit  
a carry on by the numbers  this movie is only notable for the great performance by sid james in his last carry on movie  
the jokes are bluer  the script is poorer  it is the last script written by talbot rothwell   but the music is a marked improvement  
although nearly all the regulars appear  they seem to be just going through the motions  
none of the high spirits of the earlier films are apparent here  
just a selection of crude jokes and repititive doubleentendres  
"
1	"in some regards  making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it  
try too hard  and it snaps  but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther  
in simon birch  director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique  he takes advantage of caution and poise  but also risks his movie with a few bold steps  
in the end  hes not only holding an unbroken band  but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature  
theres no doubt about it  the film that johnson has crafted is rich  
he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown  maine  leaves turn bright orange in the fall  the grass is a lush green  pure white snow falls in the winter  and the sky goes on forever  
the characters continue that turn  our two leads are simon birch  ian michael smith  and joe wenteworth  joseph mazzello   
simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital  and by age twelve hes only two feet tall  
joe is the bastard son of rebecca  ashley judd   and by age twelve hes ready to know who is father is  
naturally  the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together  from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball  
in a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith  simon birch is convinced that hes gods instrument  and there must be a reason hes so small  
joe doesnt quite buy it  but he sticks by simon  the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each others only true friends  
early on  the two meet up with ben goodrich  oliver platt   rebeccas new boyfriend  and although the bond isnt immediate  ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other  
both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability  
the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon  a testament to the acting jobs of both  
finally  jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day  and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show  
mark steven johnsons sense of drama and writing is fantastic  
the script is loosely based on john irvings novel  a prayer for owen meany  but its so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from based on to suggested by   
along those same lines  its almost unfitting to compare the two  johnson uses tension  humor  atmosphere  and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions  
by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity  gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks  but the winning idea remains the same  
simon birch is a different look at a different life  and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come  
in the present  however  its an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at

0	"synopsis  a man whose lover  paris  was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system  
the subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend  laura  and becomes addicted to virtual reality  which  due to a design flaw in his unit  recreates the dead paris  
comments  virtual seduction  executive produced by roger corman and lance h  robbins  serves as a cheaplymade precursor to strange days  a far superior film  
both movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are  ab  using technology to be with former lovers  in strange days  the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality   
interestingly  both films also take place a couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium  though strange days uses the setting far more effectively  
this exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction  
its not bad for what it is  lowbudget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality  
unfortunately  its been done before and since in much better films  a fact which ultimately leaves the scifi fan bored by this movie  
virtual seduction has many faults  one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins   
the films script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first  but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavyhanded and wooden as the movie progresses  
many important scenes seem too dark  the lighting could have been improved significantly  
the cast  a collection of veteran bmovie actors and sitcom regulars  do only a mediocre job in their roles  
jeff fahey  of the original lawnmower man  convincingly  though unenergetically  plays the lead character  
carrie genzel plays paris  the vr lover  but ami dolenz  as the current love interest  seems like a much more interesting and attractive character with a caring personality  which doesnt lend credence to the films premise  
meschach taylor  of the once popular designing women sitcom  adequately plays a scientist working on the project  but his performance isnt something to write home about either  
virtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background  
in other words  one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then  but its rather boring to just sit and watch  
the movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from bmovies in this genre  but it is still an adult rrated film due to sexual situations and a suicide attempt  
this turkey  ultimately  isnt awful  but its not particularly interesting or unique either  
dont be seduced into watching this movie unless youve got several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch

0	"the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars  
producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars  sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze  
gone is 60 seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry  
cage is legendary retired car thief  memphis raines  dont you love cute movie names   who must call upon his time worn skills to save his thickheaded brother  ribisi  from being killed  
seems a murderous crime boss  eccleston  with a fetish for wood  insert your own joke  hired brother kip to steal a ridiculous amount of expensive  exotic autos  
fifty cars  to be exact  
poor kip screws the pooch and bungles the job badly  
if the cars arent delivered in three days  bossman has a casket carved out just for kip  
literally  
if only someone could save him  
hmmmm   wonder 
what memphis is doing  
in order to give the film some emotional heft  there are several subplots designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of    yawn  excuse me  dramatic tension  
shadowing memphis is an old law enforcement foe  lindo  whos looking to send memphis away  
will he catch him  
theres old flame sway  jolie   who had her heart broken by memphis years ago  
will they get back together  
shortsighted  thrill seeker kip idolizes his brother  yet resents him for moving away from the family  
will they reconnect  
raines old mentor  duvall  has long since left the life of crime  
will memphis get him finally caught as he pulls him back into the life  one more time  
can you answer all these questions correctly in 2 seconds without seeing the film first  
ill bet you can  
following the opening credits  which fill you in on the accomplishments of the raines family through a montage of old photos  we was taken full throttle into the splendor that is memphis  
hes first shown living the good life teaching young children to drive gocarts  
in a later scene  as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under control  all the while making breakfast  a metaphor is made of shakespearean proportions  
just as a pan of grease flares up with kip clueless to how to quell it  big brother memphis calmly and efficiently throws some salt on it  
looks like everything might turn out alright after all  
you know this because the music swells on the crest of violins  
thats about as strong as the characterization gets  which is a shame  
bruckheimer has a real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount of talent given the task at hand  
monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and memphis  
or maybe its just the cars  
duvall trots out his ornery  but sweet old codger outfit  
im sure hes still laughing at taking a paycheck for this one  
lindo projects a warm hearted  but tightly focused detective that almost transcends the material  
the biggest waste of resources is vinnie jones  who plays a mute accomplice of memphis  
without saying a word  he is easily the most charismatic person in the movie  
like a blast of nitrous oxide  he attacks each scene with a straightforward zeal  
too bad his minutes onscreen are so few  
somehow  bruckheimer manages to attract top hollywood acting talent to high concept  poorly written movies  gussies up the film with lots of gold hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial hotcakes  
every time something clever happens its counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing youre watching a movie  
theres a innovative usage of black lighting that goes from being a novelty to a part of the plot  
its counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt at humor by having an asian american repeatedly failing a drivers test  
imagine the yuks  
theres a segment where one of the thieves shows another his cool fake fingerprint trick  
its countered by the lame semisubplot of a car being stolen with a bunch of heroin in the trunk  
the ramifications are never explored  
then theres the ridiculousness of the many cops who actually shoot at fleeing cars  
not only is it stupid  but its against the law  
this is a movie made of pretty  but tepid car chases strung together by just enough character interaction to move the plot along  
gone in 60 seconds aptly describes how long itll take for this marginally entertaining  but empty film to leave your memory

0	"salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets  
actors who demand such salaries might be greedy  but in some instances they are quite justified  because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation  
proof for that can be found even in the realm of lowbudget movies  and one fine example is breakaway  1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring  in  famous figure skater tonya harding  
face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movies poster  but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra  attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster  
one day she decides to retire  but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that  
realising that her life suddenly became worthless  myra starts running for her life  followed by professional assassins  
terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater  
although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities  her acting leaves much to be desired  
on the other hand  her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality  believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave bfilms a bad name  
martin sheens brother joe estevez  whose character looks like he had entered from another movies set  is the only bright spot of breakaway  
unfortunately  he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya hardings silver screen debut proved to be her last film

0	"the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summers other comic book adaptation  batman and robin  
both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts  but also their monosyllabic dialogue and emptyheaded character motivations  
in panelsized morsels  implausible plots and  rambo  esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork  but on thirty foot silver screens  its much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures  
spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons  white  who is framed by a corporate baddie  played without irony by sheen   then set on fire and left for dead  
though the movie skimps on the next few plot points  heres what i could determine  said assassin then becomes the leader of satans army  under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown  leguizamo  grating as always   
he is renamed  for reasons unbeknownst  spawn  and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon  
but when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child  he realizes that he cant be the evil superdemon hes expected to be  and he sets about avenging his untimely death  
typical of summer blockbusters  spawn is an effectsladen ninety minute rock video  
while the visions of hell are laughably crude  think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man   spawns prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold  
but the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion  spawn longs for his wife  but they dont have a single scene together before simmons death    conflict  who will triumph is not anybodys guess   and believability  not that i expected it   
so many questions are left unanswered  and im sure they wont be addressed in the inevitable sequel  
while last years the crow  city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative  which was lazy and somewhat incoherent   it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power  
spawn is an inyourface  screaming banshee of a film  these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid  but they havent the faintest idea how to make a movie

1	"most sequels dont do what theyre supposed to do like  toy story 2  does  
far too many of them end up rehashing the original and adding very little  
is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors  
thankfully   toy story 2  is a wonderful exception  
i cant remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one  
its yet another sign that pixar  the acclaimed animation studio behind  toy story  and  a bugs life   is still at the top of its game  
woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit  toy story   and things have changed a bit since the last one ended  
woody  voiced by tom hanks  is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp  
in his absence  he has assigned buzz lightyear  tim allen   now comfortable in his role as a toy  to take charge  
unfortunately  woodys trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale  and is stolen by an overzealous toy collector  wayne knight   
off to save him are buzz and members of the old  toy gang   including mr  potato head  don rickles   rex the nervous dinosaur  wallace shawn   hamm the piggy bank  john ratzenberger   and slinky dog  jim varney   
while in captivity  woody makes a startling discovery  he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950s childrens show entitled  woodys roundup   
he meets the shows other characters  which include jesse  joan cusack   his cowgirl sidekick  the wise old prospector  kelsey grammer   and bullseye  his trusty horse  
they have all been anxiously awaiting woodys arrival  as once their set is completed  they will be sold to a japanese toy museum  and finally escape storage forever  
this means woody now faces a difficult choice  
with his friends coming to rescue him  does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy  or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever  
as in the original film   toy story 2  contains firstrate animation  and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there  
reportedly  the film was originally slated for a directtovideo release  but after seeing the improvements that had been made  disney rightly decided to release it into theaters  
the film is well worth seeing on the big screen  
the colors are bright  the textures sharp  and even the human characters look more  human   
the animation is consistently seamless  with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable  
there are so many impressive sequences that id find it impossible to list them here  but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al s toy barn  the store owned by woodys captor  
pixars rendition of the family dog is also nicely done  with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it  
the voice work is also perfectly complementary  and as with the first movie  does much to help further character development  
tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz  making you forget who is doing the voice  
it was woody and buzz up there  not tom and tim  
all the cast members from the original reprise their roles  and each is excellent  
several new voices have been added  with joan cusack  kelsey grammer  and wayne knight doing fine work  
  toy story 2  is strong in characterization  and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie  
woody faces difficult choices  while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasnt yet realized his status as a toy  forcing him to see what he used to be like  
the new characters are also developed quite well  especially jesse  who narrates a sarah mclachlanaided flashback illustrating how she was loved  then forgotten by her owner  
it may be computeranimated  and it may have sappy music  but its downright touching  
the script  despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers  is endlessly clever and inventive  especially considering that its a sequel  
the reason  toy story 2  works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the originals success by redoing the same story and using the same characters  
not this one  
we get character change  new characters  and new issues brought up  
  toy story 2  is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself  
there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here  
the humor is sharp and witty  with something to amuse both kids and adults  
there are funny asides to films such as  star wars  and  jurassic park   among others  new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock em sock em robots  and appearances from other pixar efforts  a bugs life  and the 1997 short  geri s game   
  geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woodys broken arm   
the action is fast and furious  and the chases  in the street  in a toy store  in an elevator  on a baggage carousel  and in an airplane  keep getting bigger and better  
  toy story 2  never grows stagnant  because there is always something new to hold your interest  
the more you pay attention to it  the more rewarding it is  
its rare to see a film like  toy story 2  come along  because its the kind of film thats almost impossible to dislike  
its created purely to entertain  and though i enjoy a thoughtprovoking drama as much as the next person  its nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do  send us out with a smile  
its a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing  toy story 2   its the rare sequel that manages to expand on  and live up to  the original

hello mrs  robinson

1	"summary five liberal iowa graduate students share a house and carry on a tradition of a large sunday dinner  
for a year now they have been inviting a guest for dinner and discussion  
on this occasion one of the roommates  pete  ron eldard   brings home a stranger who picked him up when his car broke down  
the stranger is zack  bill paxton  who appears like a decent enough good samaritan  
nothing could be further from the truth  
after some dinner conversation it appears that zack is  among other things  a racist  you know my grandfather once said that if he knew you coloreds were going to be so much trouble wed have picked the damn cotton ourselves   and an antisemite  
an argument escalates at the dinner table and leads to violence  
after zack assaults marc  jonathan penner  and pete  zack is killed  
the roommates are at odds with what to do  
marc  pete and paulie  annabeth gish  immediately wish to call the police  
luke  courtney b  vance  and jude  cameron diaz  suggest something different  
after more discussion they agree to dispose of the body and cover it up  
they do not want to be sent to jail for what they feel was a justifiable homicide  
when it is done the roommates realize that it was easier than they thought  
so easy in fact that they decide that every sunday their dinner guest would be someone who opposes of their views  
if they all agree that the guest deserves to die  they will poison them and bury them in the back yard  
the back yard fills up rather quickly  its victims including  among others  a right to life extremist  an antienvironmentalist and a homophobe  
by the time the roommates get to their tenth victim they begin to question their methods  
are they giving the guests a chance  
are they even giving them good food anymore  
this film is what i like to call a  hidden treasure   
this film is such a pleasant surprise  
a well written  devilish satire that is funny  sexy and original  
this film should be a hit  but i guess the fact that it apparently had no marketing wouldnt give it much of a chance  
i had never heard of it until i saw a copy at my video store  
stacy title does a wonderful job directing  
she somehow finds the time to give all of the characters enough screen time to develop a distinct personality  
from the five members of the house to other key characters including sheriff stanley  nora dunn   the local law closing in on the truth  and the dream dinner guest  norman arbuthnot  ron perlman   a rush limbaugh clone who should be the roommates easiest kill  
perlman gives the films best performance  
he finds the right note as the right wing big mouth who simultaneously offends and gains followers  and may just inadvertently talk his way out of death  
the other actors are convincing as well  as all of the roommates deal with their murderous ways  
some of the characters appear to be heading down the road towards insanity  while others grieve their decisions  
when friends ask me to recommend a movie  this is usually the first one i think of  
i am not saying that this is my favorite movie  although it is in my top ten   but because the film was such a wonderful surprise  i have a fondness for it  
i also try to recommend films like this  ones that have not been seen by many people  but should  
"
1	"not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets  lies  
like bergman  director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations  
also like bergman  leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters ravished and wracked faces  
and the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergmans own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film  
all that is missing is a discussion of god  
which is not to say that secrets  lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master  
in fact  it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind  
nonetheless  what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience  even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place  that it takes some effort to adjust to the films rhythms  
once the adjustment is made  however  there are great rewards  
one such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is  
though leigh may have adopted some of bergmans stylistic touches  most obviously in an early scene of terse crosscutting during a married couples strained conversation  as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score  the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any  style  at all  
whereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality  leigh makes the camera a mere observer  almost as in a pbs documentary  
the effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors  
it is a tribute to everyone involved that  despite such scrutiny  only infrequently are we aware that anyone  is  acting  
much has been made of brenda blethyns performance  and rightly so  but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is  
there are a few missteps  
for one  except for one scene  tragicomic  as it happens   there is scant humor in the film  
this leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout  
and occasionally  as with bergman  the bluntness of the situations can seem forced  
for all that  this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention  
it is unfortunate that the audience for secrets  lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite  for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film  
in fact  it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it  
there is even a sweet but significant irony in the films unspoken take on race relations  something an american audience at least would do well to observe  
nonetheless  secrets  lies is not for the faint of heart  
though there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish  the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen  
needless to say  it is also very depressing at times  
but for many of us  of course  so is life  
and though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending  that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better  
"
0	"  nothing more than a high budget masturbation fantasy  
showgirls  nc17   contains graphic nudity  profanity  sexual situations and violence  
some people  however  keep their clothes on  
you do not watch porn films for their intellectual values  nor do you write reviews on them  
thats why this review will be short  
it seems that this film will end up in the porn section when it hits the video stores  
there is no story  script  point or acting  
only naked bodies  which is exactly the point  
here is the so called plot  nomi  the 23yearold with a dark past as a hooker  has hitchhiked from somewhere back east to perform in a show where a dancer doesnt wear much more than a light coating of powder and a big  fake smile  
no one is twisting nomis arm  
no one is holding her grandmother hostage  
she wants to do this  
and that is what she is doing till the end credits  
so whats the problem then  
whats the point  
whats the film about  
is there anyone whose aspirations could inspire less sympathy  
this film can be described in one sentence  obscene level of incompetence  excessive stupidity in the story line  gross negligence of the viewers intelligence  a prurient interest in the quick buck  
believe me  after an hour with these characters  acting and script  youll start hoping for someone to kill somebody  
elizabeth berkley makes a laughable try as the heroine of this film  that is bad even for eszterhas script  
her character is the only one that is at least half written and she could really have done better  
her character denies the fact that she is a whore for the industry  selling her body to the hungry eyes of the horny public  
  i am not a whore  
i am a dancer   she screams  but does it in such an over dramatized way that youll start laughing  
in fact the acting in  showgirls  brings terrible to a new and previously unknown level  
not one single achievement  besides the conventional cinematography  is worth mentioning  
it is a total waste of time and money  
there is not a single moment of what you might call intelligence  
the dialogue is structured of ancient stereotypes and cliches lined up one after another  
its attempt to even imagine to have half a brain results in a catastrophe  
  in my films   writes director paul verhoeven  basic instinct  total recall    i hold the mirror up to life   
well  excuse me  
his attempt to go behind the scenes of las vegas  and as he put it  show the naked truth   is simplified and unreal  
occasionally  between his collection of mistakes and logical irrationalities  screenwriter joe eszterhas  the creator of some of the worst screenplays in hollywood history  inserts some lines of deep morality  that sound something like this   hey  i see you  
i see that youre hiding    from what   
  from you   
yes  and even the only decent line in this film   nomi is what las vegas is all about  cant save showgirls from going under  
its a strange phenomena  
its not erotic  because it lacks sensuality  
not dramatic  because it lacks the acting  
and not intelligent because it lacks a story  
it is simply verhovens bad excuse for making pornography  
you want to see naked women  
bare breasts  
full frontals  
its nothing wrong with that  
but in that case i suggest that you rent a porn film in your local video store  and not waste time surviving through eszterhas pathetic dialogue  
b qualities  while its only a high budget pornfilm

1	"if he doesn92t watch out  mel gibson is in danger of being known as someone other than mad max  
of course there are still a few big guns in this film  but there92s some accomplished acting too  
although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty antihero skin as his career progresses  here he explores a new genre  the businessman as action hero  
in ron howard92s latest film  gibson plays tom mullen  a gazillionaire airline owner whose son is snatched from the junior science fair by kidnappers  
mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom  but when things fall apart he rethinks the situation  
a veteran of numerous hardnosed business negotiations  the tycoon realizes that in order to get his son back alive  he has to play his hand differently  
the casting is what puts this film over the top  
the trio of gibson  the kidnappers mastermind  gary sinise  and fbi team leader  delroy lindo  play off of each other wonderfully  
sinise is perfect as the driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark  
his speech to mullen over a walkie talkie about h  g  wells92 morlocks and eloi reveal his vision of 
society  mullen and the other glitteratti frolic up on high while sinise and the other lowlifes dwell below  feeding off the unsuspecting  
gibson92s character is an allamerican hero with a few flaws  
his cowboy 
tactics tend to work  but they are also what got him into this situation to begin with  
in a round about way  if he weren92t known as a man who i s willing to buy his way out of trouble  his son wouldn92t have been kidnapped  
as sinise says  you92re a payer  
you did it once and now you92re going to do it again   
one of the nicest elements of this film is that most of the characters actually have personalities  
lindo calls home to talk to his kids  obviously shaken at working this case  
even the kidnappers are real people  arguing about the ultimate fate of sean mullen and feeding him candy bars  
gibson92s breakdown on the balcony of their penthouse apartment is especially effective  
it92s one of the best filmed representations of a man92s world falling apart that i92ve seen  
it92s not all perfect  
the shoot em upending  while emotionally satisfying seems tacked on to be just that rather than to provide a powerful resolution  
as well crafted as the scene is  we92ve seen it before  
mullen92s wife  rene russo  has several good moments  but occasionally just seems to be there  
while adequate  brawley nolte  sean  doesn92t provide much to the film other than occupying space to build the story around  
but you92ll ignore these problems as each minute of the movie builds on the previous one  
forget about the large coke  you won92t want to leave for that five minute break an hour later  
"
0	"starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king  the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics  but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing publicparticularly kids wanted to see  
therefore  its with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas  
despite some innovation and risk taking  the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes  as are its characters  
a group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the  savages  that live there  
the natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust  
only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash  
the ending  as it turns out  is not entirely a happy one and is one of the films finer moments  
the characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth  
governor ratcliffe  for instance  is a snobbish  singleminded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses  
captain john smith is a blond hunk who  while  slightly  misguided  is good at heart  
pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time  
she even comes complete with insignificant best friend  
again  against tradition  talking animals arent used  but a lusty  wizened  talking tree is  
this is an odd compromise  but its one of the few elements that really work  
the animals are a delight  and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation  
maybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes  
the talking tree  who seems to have a thing for john smith  is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch  
the music  a welcome delight in the later disney films  is mostly a let down here  with the exception of the catchy and motivational   colors of the wind   
mel gibson  as the voice of john smith  has a solid singing voice and should have been used more  
the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs  the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character  
i was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time  
even the children in the audience seemed restless  
while theres no stopping a kid from seeing something that they wantor disney wants them tomost i believe will be disappointed  
perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history  
its all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movies entertainment value  but doing so to historical facts doesnt work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewers minds and plot holes that are never filled  
even the artwork  another disney strong point  varies greatly in quality  making any story problems even more obvious  
as mentioned above  there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film  
for instance  if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with  savages   why did he so quickly change his previous  kill as many indians as i can  attitude  
if he was such a nice guy after all  he should have changed his ways long before this  
or how about pocahontas amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men  
i can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience  but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot  history was modified in the film anyway  
as it is  i wonder if it doesnt give kids the wrong impression  
in short  the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set  
while disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions  they end up failing on too many levels  
"
0	"in my review of  the spy who shagged me   i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics  every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series  it is followed by a third movie that is a bore  
the cause is probably complacency  a studio sighs with relief when part 2 lives up to expectations and figures part 3 is a sure thing  
  scream 3  provides the latest proof of this rule  
in los angeles production has begun on  stab 3  return to woodsboro   the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott  neve campbell   
however  life soon starts imitating art  and  stab  cast members turn up stabbed  
smelling yet another book deal  gale weathers  courteney cox arquette  comes to the set to investigate and finds her exboyfriend dewey riley  david arquette  acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer  parker posey   the actress playing gale in  stab 3   elsewhere  our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name  
  
  
until she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice  
the late randy meeks  jamie kennedy  makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy  
he notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with  
indeed   scream 3  tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all  the murder of sidneys mother maureen before the beginning of the original  scream   
at the scene of each murder in  scream 3   the killer leaves a photo of sidneys mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer  
to find out who the killer is  our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureens missing years when she was a starlet appearing in lowbudget horror films  
  even with that little information  you can probably already guess what the killers relationship to sidney is   
unlike its predecessors   scream 3  doesnt have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer  
the characters we do suspect are all undeveloped  so that by the end we dont even care who the killer is  
the jaded detective  patrick dempsey   
the kinky producer  lance henriksen   
the driven young director  scott foley   
the ingenue  emily mortimer   
the character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random  
wes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret  so its quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen  
the series trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious  
possibly its the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson  who penned the first two  or maybe its that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche  
i groaned as an attack on sidney from the first  scream  was repeated momentformoment in the hollywood set of her home  
at some point  referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas  
  scream 3  also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles  
look for jenny mccarthy  carrie fisher  patrick warburton  puddy from  seinfeld    roger corman  and jason mewes and kevin smith  as jay and silent bob  to walk through at some point  
all these bit players put forth more effort than the series returning stars  who are probably saving their energy for the long post  scream  job search  
another prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass  more movies are copying  the blair witch project  s web strategy  
  scream 3  has three official websites that  wink  wink  pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie  
the sunrise studios site  scream3  com  has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the  latest stab 3 news   
theres also a gail weathers official site  galeweathers  com  and a sunrise sucks site that has more  stab  scandals the studio wants to cover up  sunrisesucks  com   
craven and company promise that this is the last installment in the  scream  series  
while i hope thats true  i dont hold out much hopehorror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters  
theres a  halloween h2k  in the works  even though michael myers was beheaded in  h20   and a  freddy vs  jason  has been talked about for awhile  despite the fact that both characters were  killed off   
theres bound to be a  scream 4  someday  even if it starts over with a new set of moviestar wannabes  
bottom line  they should have called this one  yawn   
"
1	"  very bad things   is the most delightfully morbid film of the year  a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldnt help but be won over by the material  
the film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas  
the groomtobe is kyle fisher  jon favreau   who is about to be married to the controlling  weddingobsessed laura  cameron diaz   
the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd  christian slater   quiet charles  leland orser   and brothers  michael  jeremy piven  and family man adam  daniel stern   
after a wild night of gambling  boozing  and drugs  a stripper  carla scott  who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room  but after a freak accident  to everyones terror  she is killed  
as robert puts it   there are two options  go to the police and go to prison  or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her   
after a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body  robert is forced to kill him as well  
  okay  there is only one option now  
you can forget about calling the police   he says  
by the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer  most of them are overcome with guilt  which sets off an even more elaborate series of event  that includes much  much more murder  doublecrosses  and the inevitable wedding from hell  
  very bad things   which is actor peter bergs feature film directing debut  is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that   theres something about mary   wanted to be  
it pulls out all the stops to create something fresh  original  and hilarious  even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence  gore  and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end  
the screenplay  also written by berg  is  to put it mildly  very funny and courageous  
during the second act of the film  some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death  which was beginning to undermine the humor  but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed  
the dialogue is edgy and inventive  and this film proves that a movie doesnt necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable  
theres more fun  i think  in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts  
cameron diaz gives her best performance to date here  and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura  who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends  
diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january  
by the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger  and reciting lines like   stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs   i couldnt help but crack up at how  ballstothewall  this film had become  
jeanne tripplehorn creates another character original  as daniel sterns wife  who late in the picture  we discover  is a tough kickboxer that should not be messed around with  
it is at this level that   very bad things   was so entertaining and surprising  
just when you thought you could predict what was going to happen  there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky  
the last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further overthetop  
although i enjoyed the film immensely  let me make this clear   very bad things   is not a movie for everyone  
it is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen  it is more violent and bloody than a rrated film usually is  and it is offensive  
luckily  these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy  since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a noholdsbarred  politically incorrect comedy  
the fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and  safe  widereleases coming out lately  still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry  
"
1	"with the success of the surprise hit alien  directed by ridley scott  a sequel was inevitable  
in fact  after watching the first film  a sequel was wanted  particularly by this reviewer  
handing over the directors chair to recent box office gem james cameron  who had only made two films previous to this one  pirahna ii  a surprisingly dull film  and terminator  making cameron a household name   the alien series got a facelift of immense proportions  
instead of being a suspensescience fiction film  cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture  
what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created  
a film like aliens comes along only once in a while  and when it does  audiences are usually unprepared for it  
i never saw this movie in theaters  but i wish i could have  
the terror and fright must have been unimaginable  most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear  
aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen  
with a science fiction plot  cameron gives aliens added testosterone  pumping up the action and fire power from the original film  
in fact  aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original  
perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the heroor heroine  as the case may be  
never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film  and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character  
sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about  
placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual  but because of weavers presence  a woman is the only suitable hero  
aliens begins 57 years after alien ended  
lieutenant ellen ripley  weaver  is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened  
she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens  but  the company  is doubtful  
they explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left  
despite stern warnings from ripley  the company remains rigid and wont call the families back  
however  when the company loses contact with the colony  ripleys story seems much more feasible  
one of the companys directors  carter burke  paul reiser   wants to gather a team to travel to the planet  
this team includes a buff private vasquez  jenette goldstein   a questionable corporal hicks  michael biehn   and a loyal android bishop  lance henriksen   
burke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony  
arriving on the planet  the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoontype environment  
the only survivor is 12 year old rebecca  newt  jorden  carrie henn   
ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become  and she becomes newts surrogate mother  
ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened  and soon  all hell breaks loose  
aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scotts version  it also multiplies the number of aliens in general  
alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member  except ripley  who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo  
aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens  and as a result  the chills are incredibly heightened  
then again  this is james cameron  the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2  judgment day  
he is the best action director out there  topping renny harlin  who directed cliffhanger   and only he could create something as terrifying as this film  
it seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes  and aliens has the motherload  
with perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film  aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion  
i cant recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout  never dropping for a moment  
just when you think the movie is over  something else will occur  and it starts right back up again  
with a seemingly endless conclusion  aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history  
this scene is usually the one remembered most from the film  as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen  
using flawless special effects  the climax is exhausting  leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety  
of course  for a film of this genre to work properly  the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see  
aliens is completely realistic  even a decade after its initial release  
the special effects are wonderfully seamless  with a terrifying alien to go with them  
one of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music  composed by cameronregular james horner  
horner has created a terrific score  receiving an oscar nomination for his work  
not only that  horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film  or science fiction film ever  and that includes 2001  a space odyssey  which was mainly a compilation of wellknown composers   
in fact  the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music  
the production design is incredible  which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy  
dark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive  but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from welllit locations  
normally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer  aliens uses lights to scare the viewer  
then  of course  is the cinematography  which uses point of view shots  along with video feeds in order to build suspense  
some of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley  
surprisingly  the acting is not only above average for this genre  but some of the best  
sigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley  incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hardedged persona  
weaver soars above the rest in this film  but she is supposed to  
carrie henn gives an above average performance for a child  developing a threedimensional character from her quiet attitude  
lance henriksen is terrific as bishop  showing that androids dont always have to be flat characters  
jenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role  and steals several scenes of her own  though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isnt fighting   
michael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film  
however  biehn does a good job  making it seem original again  
paul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director  but reiser manages to pull it off quite well  however  i still see him as paul on tvs  mad about you    
a very good cast  which also includes bill paxton and william hope  highlights this action film  making it stand out from others  
aliens is rightfully rated r for violence  gore  language  and terror  
aliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre  as alien was more of a suspensehorror film  
aliens pumps up the stakes  and cameron directs it with professional quality  
cameron certainly knows how to make a good action film  but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen  
technically astonishing  aliens only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed  
aside from this  you probably wont experience anything like aliens for quite a while

0	"annie wilson  cate blanchett   a widow who struggles to raise her children in a small town in georgia is asked for help by local authorities in solving the case of a missing woman  
annie is something of a psychic  she has involuntary bouts with the supernatural where she can see the past and the future and physically feel the actions happenning to her she envisions  
her  gift  leads to the arrest of a nasty wife beater who may or may not have killed the pretty rich girl found in the swamp on his property  
in an ultra conservative backwoods town will her testimony based on her psychic visions hold up in court  
do they even have the right man  
whats good about it  
aside from keanu reeves giving one of the best performances of his career as the loathable redneck donnie barksdale  there is little else going for the film  
whats not so good about it  
lame  unoriginal screenplay  
predictable ending  
suspense scenes that are just plain boring  
ridicously trite characterization makes the entire south out to be ingnorant  hateful goobers  
relentless in its emotional sensationaliztion  
overall critique  
  the gift  is one of those movies that makes you wonder where youve seen this story before  
its a collection of every cliche and stereotype of the south ever made  and coming from a yankee like me who dislikes the south thats really saying something  
for an established  talented director sam raimi is unable to provide any kind of originality to this film  
its predictable from the first scene  the screenplay is written like a ripoff of a photocopied bootlegged play  
you know that as nasty as the murder suspect is he didnt actually do it  
its no surprise either who the real villain turns out to be and what their motive was  
sigh  how trite  
for a supernatural thriller this is neither scary nor intense because its so cliche  
  the gift  is basically a glorified bmovie  
"
1	"after indecent proposal and up close and personal  redford was wise to direct himself in a picture at last  
redford may look great onscreen  but over the past few years  hes proven himself a bigger talent behind the camera  
ordinary people is one of the best films of the nineteeneighties  and it was the first picture he helmed  
while the milagro beanfield war was only occasionally successful at combining magicrealism with    um  
realism  and ive never been much of a fan of a river runs through it  to the chagrin of many   quiz show was dazzling  energetic and convincing  
the horse whisperer represents both his directorial return to nature films and the first time in that subgenre redford seems equally concerned with humans and scenery  
scottthomas plays annie maclean  an uptight but respected new york magazine editor whose daughter grace  johanssen  loses a leg and a good friend when an early morning ride climaxes with their horses colliding with a semi  
graces horse survived  but barely  and has gone mad  
annie refuses to put the animal out of his misery  believing that if the horse heals it will mend graces newlybroken spirit  
eventually  mother and daughter travel alone to montana to be with tom booker  redford   a famed  horse whisperer  who has a gift of calming horses with simple looks and touches  leaving busy husband neill behind  
eventually  they move onto the booker ranch with the rest of toms family  and annie finds herself falling in love with all things montana  including  naturally  tom  the wise and lonely trainer  
the horse whisperer is delicately made  
i dare say lyrical  since to many peoples ear  that word is synonymous with boring  
hardly  
the horse whisperer has little to offer in the way of surprise  but it does have an honesty that is refreshing and consistently enjoyable to watch  especially in the final third of the story  
scottthomas and johanssen seem like mother and daughter  and you have no doubt believing that the mountain vistas would put these new yorkers under a spell  especially since d  p  
robert richardsons photography casts montana as heaven on earth  
  a gimmicky but effective technique the filmmakers employ is a switch in aspect ratio from squarish to widescreen when the central location shifts from new york to montana   
the underrated sam neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt  emotive performance as the niceguy husband  who is as authoritive and likeable as tom  
he is indeed a refreshing change from the sexist  lout of a husband so many writers resort to as a shortcut for explaining away the cheating spouses motivation  
unfortunately  one of the horse whisperers only flaws is the chemistry between wouldbe lovers scottthomas and redford  
i liked both of them  but i didnt necessarily believe that redford would fall for such a cold fish  even if the countryside air thawed her slightly  
luckily  and curiously   this is such a rich and textured movie that it doesnt quite mattertheir adultery seems like an afterthought  the obligatory subplot that ties many of the characters complex relationships together  
"
0	"i cried during babe  
i admit it  
the special effects  the story  the great dialogue were woven together so delicately and successfully that my mind lost track that this was a  childrens film  so much so that  yes  i got a little overly sentimental  
such  my friend  is the power of cinema  
when word came out that they were using this newly developed fx for a doctor dolittle update  in which eddie murphy plays the title character  and many great comic actors supply the voices  my anticipation rose to great expectations  
they cant possibly drop the ball on this one  
cant miss  
cant possibly miss  
they missed  
what went wrong  
after much thought  i supply three general rules  
  1  dont let a television actressturnedcomedy movie director near an urbanite script  i  e   penny marshalls dreadful  preachers wife    
betty thomas worked wonders with  the brady bunch movie   but the same sitcomairiness doesnt quite work here  
its as if she lifted a generic sitcom  and iced it with light doses of modern rb  
take away the black cast  take away the atrocious soundtrack  and you have the residue of some mid80s kirk cameron show  
  2  the greater the cast  the less the individual castmember has to do  i  e   
  con air    
it is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman  garry schandling  john leguizimo  ellen degeneres  and gilbert godfried in your lineup  but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped  stereotyped characters  onelineatatime  
its even worse  because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you dont get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits  
now there are three character actors who do get special treatment  albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project hes in  and the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy  
norm mcdonald fares nearly as well  as a stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle  
but theres little humor here  
that rests on the shoulders of chris rock  sorely miscast and unfunny as the voice of their wiseass guinea pig  
even the mouth is illsynched  
  3  dont let the special effects technicians walk away with the script  
theres a certain timing thats mandatory in comedy  
to have this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim hensons creature shop  is a travesty  
this is not to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies arent welltimed laughfests  with the right director  they can be and have  
here  betty thomas is clearly over her head  
i wish i could commend the special effects  but theyre merely average  
count the number of times where the animals mouth is turned away from the camera  or too far to notice  or illsynched  
this is less a  babe  and more of a  look whos barking  clone  
you may be wondering  how does eddie murphy fare   
well  he came back with the exceptional  nutty professor   and i dont doubt he can come back again  
here  hes tied into a straight man and given little to do  
the exceptions are when he fears hes going crazy  a far cry from his smarterthanyoud expect routine that hes more adept at  
its unfortunate that he is where richard pryor was ten years ago  making lame comedies without the same bite he had given in his early years  
after all this  whats left  
butt jokes  
a lot of butt jokes  
i guess for kids that may be funny  but i was stonefaced  
if theres a lesson the film may be telling us  is that animals have feelings too  and they care way too much for your butt  
"
1	"warning  if you actually wish to see the film  stop reading this and see it  
while i dont blow any plot details  the more you know about a movie  the more disappointing and built up it becomes  waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing   
but  in a nutshell  its a good film  
star wars episode i  the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim 
never having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world  i was more into star trek  the next generation   it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment  the phantom menace  
however  it cant be ignored  
endless toys lining the shelves  endless news reports  and a multibillion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult  
with the level of this hype  one would recall an overhyped disaster from 1998  godzilla  which definitely failed to live up to expectations  
thankfully  the phantom menace does much  much better  
while the  first  star wars trilogy told the story of jedi knight luke skywalker  the prequels backpedal to tell the backstory of obi wan kenobi and a young jedi named anakin skywalker  who would become the father of luke and eventually become darth vader   
without blowing too much of the story  the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo  which is being held hostage by a greedy trade federation  and its up to two jedi knights  quigon ji  played by liam neeson and obiwan kenobi  played by ewan mcgreggor  to free it  
the phantom menace has taken a literal beating from various film critics  leaving me to lower my expectations somewhat  
common complaints range from lack of characterization  weak narrative  poor direction of actors  the dated style  and too much focus over special effects  
still  film critics often apply much historical theory in regards to film criticism  much of which the average film buff does not care for  
hence  this film is a lot of fun and definitely an improvement over the previous films  even with the  improvements  in the special editions   
there are many memorable sequences throughout the film  ranging from the fast and furious  pod race  sequence  which is a take on the chariot races in  ben hur   and the many fight scenes involving legions of battle droids  
utilizing technology that is light years beyond anything made before  special effects and computers are used to create everything from monsters to robots to amazing cityscapes with incredible detail  
no matter how many times you watch this film  you will catch something new  
the level of humour is a bit higher than the previous films as well  mostly conveyed through the reluctant hero jar jar binks  who belongs to a race known as the gungans  
best described as an mr  bean from the planet naboo  he steals the show  
unfortunately  being that he is a computergenerated character  tells a bit about the direction of the actors  although natalie portman as the queen is pretty effective  as is jake lloyd as the young anakin skywalker   
with star wars mania at an all time high  there is the risk that the film will disappoint  i myself had my doubts   which this film does have a tendency to do at times  
there are a few logic problems with the plot  several things are left unchecked  and at times seems to be made only for diehard star wars fans  although the appearance of the tusken raiders makes for more than a few laughs   
that  and young anakin skywalker is a really annoying character  coming off as a smarmy  arrogant brat  with such an attitude  its no wonder why he turns to the dark side   
still  it seems that many people  especially critics  are missing the point  
the film is some of the most fun 2 and a half hours that youll blow in your life  which is something i wouldnt mind doing again  
while it may not have the psychological impact of an academy award contender  who really cares  
the film is pure fun from beginning to end  
and isnt that what really matters

1	"lake placid is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie  ok so maybe it is  but this one is enjoyable  and clever  
actually it comes off more of a comedy than a horror film  
well the ending is kinda scary  but in most horrorcomedies they are  
i will admit that lake placid isnt an oscar worthy film  but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny  
bridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating  is forced to go to lake placid and investigate a tooth  after a man is bit in half  
she gets there but really doesnt understand why she is there  
bill pullman plays a man also investigating what happened  along with the sherriff and a rich croc obsessed man  they go out and find what is going on  
what they find though isnt great  
a huge and i mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid  over 150 years old  he has migrated here for who knows why  
they have to fight against the croc and try to trap him so they can study him and see where he came from  
betty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid  and well youll have to see the movie to find out  
her character is very funny and foulmouthed  which is surprising to hear betty spew words and phrases that are pretty bad  but funny  
to me the movie came off as a spoof of jaws  
with the opening sequence  and some others  it is not original and is  
when you watch this movie  you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it  
david e  kelly who is the mastermind of the practice and ally mcbeal  writes this movie with ease and surprisingly does a great job  
the characters have smartmouths  two foul  and some great oneliners  
but believe me  dont take lake placid too seriously or you wont like it  
but it is a movie that can be enjoyed as a fun popcorn type movie  
but i guess it rates above the popcorn rating  
sit back  watch the movie  laugh  scream  and whatever you want  
even though the movie is r  and i put violence and gore  
theres really not that much gore  but what there is might seem kinda gross to some  
lake placid is a smart  clever  funny  and scary movie that i enjoyed and i think you will too

1	"it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive  so delicate  so insightful and yes  even so enjoyable  
somehow  the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through  
set in the 1940s  the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells  tobey maguire  ride with the devil   
an orphan  twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents  he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr  wilbur larch  michael caine  little voice   father figure to the orphans of st  cloud  obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help  
figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage  he might as well be of use  dr  larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics  
soon homer is delivering babies like a professional  
he refuses to perform abortions  instead wondering why the couples just didnt behave more responsibly  
larch  too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals  marvels that homer  continues to have such high expectations of people   
such is the result of an insulated upbringing  
though skilled in certain medical procedures  homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else  
he finally figures that in order to find his place in the world  he must go out into it  
befriending a young couple who had come to see dr  larch  he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived  
thus  homer begins his worldly instruction  with new friend candy kendall  charlize theron  the astronauts wife  a willing tutor  
tobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to lifes questions    
many of which he was unaware needed to be asked  
he demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing  
michael caine is  in a word  brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans  many of whom he helped to bring into the world  
calling them  princes of maine  kings of new england  in his ritualistic goodnight  mr  caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine  
delroy lindo  a life less ordinary  has many powerful moments as mr  rose  the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins  
director lasse hallstrom  whats eating gilbert grape   and screenwriternovelist john irving  the world according to garp   who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter  
regardless of ones personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion  it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers  
the title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers  
figuring the rules didnt apply to them since they didnt have a hand in writing them  they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along  
dr  larch  in his own way  acts similarly  
there is a danger in that line of reasoning  
god has also given us a set of rules  
unlike the list posted in the cider house  gods rules  if followed  promise us benefits beyond our imagination  
and yet  many continue to ignore his  rules  preferring to make up their own as they go through life  
  trust in the lord with all thine heart  and lean not unto thine own understanding   
proverbs 3  5 kjv 
just as a builder follows a designers blueprint or a conductor follows a composers score  why shouldnt we follow the rules of life given to us by lifes architect for our own blessing

0	"i feel sorry for the financial backers of  waterworld   which is supposedly the most expensive film ever made  at 172 million    and is also one of the stupidest  boy did they get ripped off  
in fact  this film is not really a movie  but more of an amusement park ride with a plot  
its not even just another case of cliches strung together  well  it is that too   its something thats painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws  
kevin costner stars as a man who is some kind of mutant half manhalf fish  
he is an explorermariner on an alternate earth that is completely covered by water because the polar ice caps melted  
hes referred to as the mariner  but they  the meaner  would have been a more appropriate title because hes cold  rigid  and strict  and hes supposed the be the good guy  
he docks at a small floating village of sorts  
he trades dirt for money and this introduces us to the other important characters  
first we meet one of the villains  then the soontobe heroine  a child prodigy  a wacky inventor  and a group of primitive people that somehow have some of the technology we have today  but also some of the lowtech tools used by pirates and vikings  
immediately the films biggest flaw is apparent  are these people primitive or highly advanced  
it doesnt seem like anyone can read yet they have skidoos and airplanes  
how are these things powered  
and if they have airplanes  couldnt they just keep flying until they reached dry land  
also  if the planet is completely covered in water where did they get the materials to make these things  
im sorry  im all for checking your brain at the door when going to the movies  but elements like these cannot go unnoticed because they draw our attention away from the story and confuse us  
there was potential here for a good pirate story set in medieval times before modern technology  so why mix the two together  
it doesnt make any sense  
there really isnt much of a plot here because the story moves so quickly it never takes time to explain anything  
the only thing we learn is that the prodigy child  enola  mojorino   has a tattoo on her back that is supposedly a map to  dryland   
who put the tattoo there and how come it has taken them this long to figure this out  
we never get an answer  just a stupid action movie about whoever can get the girl will be the victor of sorts if they reach dryland  
to make a long  boring  stupid  and just plain bad story short  the mariner escapes with a woman named helen  tripplehorn  and enola  
they sail for a long time  encountering some strange people in the process and fight off  the smokers  as lead by the idiot villain deacon  hopper   who kidnaps enola  
the story becomes a overly grand adventure with the mariner taking on an army of goons  rescuing enola  and bringing them all to salvation  how original   
even with all its special effects  action  and adventure this film is boring  
not a single character is likable  therefore neither is the plot  
dennis hopper completely rips off jack nicholsons joker  while costner just plain rips  
still   waterworld  is professionally made with a good production design and an original idea but no substance to it  
i just hope they dont make a sequel  
"
1	"when i left the theater after seeing david lynchs  lost highway   i remarked to a fellow moviegoer   i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears   
in his first feature film in five years  lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture  eraserhead  on the weirdness scale  
you wont  know  what happened when its over  though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses  
it is difficult to describe the plot of this film  because it depends partly on how you interpret it  
i can  however  describe what we see on the screen  l  a  jazz saxophonist fred madison  bill pullman  and his wife renee  patricia arquette   whom he clearly suspects of infidelity  receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep  
they are  naturally enough  more than a little frightened and confused  and it doesnt help matters any when  mystery man   robert blake  approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving  
the next morning  fred finds another videotape which  to his  and our  surprise  shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom  
he is convicted of her murder and sent to death row  where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton  balthazar getty   
the perplexed prison officials release dayton  whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways  most notably his affair with alice wakefield  arquette again   a blonde who is otherwise renees spitting image  and another encounter with the mystery man  
i would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more  but suffice it to say that lynch doesnt offer any neat wrap  ups  nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion  the cinematic demons of  lost highway  are out in full force from beginning to end  
this description might make  lost highway  sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism  but in fact  while there are traces of lynchs weird sense of humor  this film is anything but giddy most of the time  
on the contrary  lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynchs previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther  
the film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery  rather  the character  is  the mystery  
there are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion  distrust  and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded  fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goingson here  
we  the audience  are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this  probably freds  in my opinion  and what  in that case  the other characters and events are meant to represent  
all of this proceeds  appropriately  in lynchs typically slowpaced  idiosyncratic style  
as is often the case  lynch relies on sound  imagery  and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story  and in  lost highway  it works perfectly  
there are scenes when the camera lingers on freds blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway  or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coils  song to the siren  can be heard faintly in the background  nothing is technically  happening  in these scenes  yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as  if not more so than  the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity  
lynchs direction and director of photography pete demings darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story  
well  most of the time  anyway  i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist  which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewers attention because of its tieins to the original mystery  
the main characters in this  reality   dayton  a wellmeaning but none too intelligent 24yearold   a sleazy gangster  who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character   and his pornstar girlfriend  the blond arquette   are nothing you couldnt find in any of the two dozen  pulp fiction  wannabes  fortunately  the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements  such as the strained  awkward conversations between pete and his parents  help to preserve the films spooky  unnerving tone during this stretch  
lynchs typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality  while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery  are also somewhat overdone here  
its not exactly exploitative  like almost everything else in this film  the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills  as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off  
that said  these minor flaws dont prevent  lost highway  from attaining its place as one of the darkest  most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years  
it is a oneway ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind  and as such it is gripping  intense  and brilliantly effective

gibson plays porter  a burglar shot and left for dead by his wife  deborah kara unger  in an alltoobrief cameo  and partner  henry  after a successful heist  
as a morgue attendant sets about removing the bullets from porters back  porter miraculously springs back to life  
he makes it his mission  as a walking dead man without a conscience  to exact revenge on those who screwed him and reclaim his share of the loot  
  in a running gag  porter demands 70 000  but everybody mishears him and assumes hes after the entire 130 000 haul   
in his travels  or travails   porter encounters several other onenamed villainous cretins like fairfax  james coburn as a whitehaired  millionaire thief  and carter  kristofferson  as a brownhaired  millionaire thiefthe kingpin of the obligatory  operation    
helgelands film  which was recut by mel the producer  is devoid of an imperative dime store charm  
the novelty of seeing a big movie star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly  a  because the bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs  and b  because mels schtick doesnt evolve from act onehes the terminator stranded in a plot without a scifi hook to keep us interested after the initial sadistic thrill is gone  
payback should have been called playback  its a 102minute loop of the same short sequence  
  mel   i want my money   
anonymous villain   no   
mel shoots gun  
anonymous villain dies  
mel meets up with his hooker friend  bello   
second verse  same as the first   
its not porters singlemindedness that robs the film of snap  crackle  and pop  as a character who has already  died  once  he has nothing to lose and so much to gain  
the movie lacks danger  
the only thing porter is in jeopardy of is putting the audience to sleep  
payback has a gritty  metallic look to it that also becomes monotonous  its cinematography would be more appropriate in one of those bleak urban psychodramas that come out of england every couple of months  
  director of photography ericson core should have been fired early on for lighting bello  so vavavavoom in permanant midnight  to look like a potato in a gregg allman wig   
to analyze such mediocrity is to grant payback far more attention than it deserves  
perhaps only someone as experienced with antagonistsasprotagonists as tarantinolook what he did with the similar heroless botchedrobbery tale reservoir dogscould have pulled off this material  a loose remake of john boormans point blank   
the movie presents us with the conventions of pulp fiction  all women are femme fatales  even the cops are in on it  etc   and crosses them with the conventions of cheesy tv crime melodramas  death is never in the cards for the main character  etc   but transcends neither

0	"this is the worst movie ive seen since the  so bad i walked out on it   jingle all the way   
it is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven fueled by crap  
it is crap through and through  
nothing works in this film  as to be expected from joel schumacher  who has made only one watchable film in his entire career  that being  cousins    
heres a man who admits hes a medicore director  a rather charmingly selfeffacing statement  
but truth be told  he is much worse than mediocre  
not all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though  akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again  
there is no plot anywhere  and the  dialogue  is unrelentingly shallow  preposterous  and boring  
they set up mr  freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife  then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest oneliners  
it turns him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death  
but thats par for course  nothing in this film makes any sense  including half of arnold schwarzeneggers lines  
as mr  freeze  arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once  
this is the same problem he had in  jingle all the way   and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass  
personally  i think that he has more pull with the directors and doesnt retake scenes to make him understandable  
compare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in  batman  robin   
apparently  james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold  
uma thurman is not as bad  but nothing resembling good either  
her poison ivy vamps around terribly  chewing up scenery left and right  
and her pamela isley scenes are marred by subsnl standard  acting   as if shes reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment  
given the  script   its a wonder it didnt happen more frequently  
there is no redeeming feature in this film  not george clooney as batman  chris odonnell as robin  nor alicia silverstone as batgirl  
michael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred  as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance  
in fact  there was something unsettling about his appearance  which seems to have been accomplished without any makeup tricks  looking as if it were scenes from a documentary about a dying man  
unfortunately  every scene about alfreds sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance  they just go through the motions  losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart  
the movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle  you know theres a bunch of people  but instead of a melee  schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist  
theres never a moment of awe  wonder  or mayhem  
the only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects  which are impressive  and probably expensive   
even then  the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable  
the hockey team from hell  
not even the tv series got that stupid  at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that  batman  robin  showcases   
frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do  
blink  and youll miss elle macpherson as julie madison  vivica fox as a  why is she even in the film  vamp in freezes lair  with all of two lines   and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had  
and in what almost seems like an effort to save on costs  vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs  fries  she isnt even filmed well enough to look good  trust me  shes quite attractive outside of this dreck   
and as if the film werent bad enough to limp along with bad direction  bad dialogue  bad performances  and bad fight scenes  there are inconsistencies and illogic galore  
i know its nitpicky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs  why the characters arms arent ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish a onearmed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet  while holding on to another person no less   or where the moisture comes from when freezes weapon creates tons if ice  
thats all traditional comic book stuff  
but why does batman spring a trap for freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of bystanders  
why is there a big switch clearly marked   heat  in mr  freezes lair  
why do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on mr  freeze hand to hand  
why does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her  
why do batman  robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in response to an emergency  
and since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones  why dont they wear masks to filter it out  
i could go on and on  
  batman  robin  is a braindead  pointless  garish  loud film that should still reign as the  worst film of the year  by the time 1998 rolls along  
note to warner bros   if youre going to make another batman film  please replace schumacher with nearly anyone  
because it could actually get worse than this  
what schumacher does not understand is that  comic book  doesnt automatically equal unbearable idiocy  
the true equation seems to be schumacher  batman  unbearable idiocy

it seems that a woman has also been kidnappedshe is the sister of one of them  e  t  s 
henry thomas  and the girlfriend of another  flannery  and the asking price is 2 million  which said snots are unable to cough up alone  
they even cut off walkens finger to show they mean business  because they are desperate to save the womans life  
suicide kings is a terrible film  
walken aside  there isnt a single appealing cast member  
ofallon creates characters that are functional types without any resonance  
in an amusingly unironic scene  walken plays poker with the foursome and describes each of their personalities to a teeits as if he was reading the summary sheet for a casting director  
the plot is another issue entirely  
ofallon is someone whom im betting has seen reservoir dogs and the usual suspects too many times  for not only does his story veer off on bizarre tangents from whence they never return  do we really need the scene where dennis leary beats up an abusive father with a toaster  which is entirely unrelated to both the story and learys character  or the numerous anecdotal sequences    but the central plot itself is a serpentine mess  filled with crosses and double crosses and triple crosses    
by the fourth big revelationtwist  i had completely tuned out  wondering what on earth attracted these actors to the material  
recently a peer  a fellow young filmmaker  informed me that he had an idea for a movie about four guys  the mob  and the fbi  
it occurred to me then whats wrong with indies like suicide kings  i suspect ofallon has never met a mobster  is not a rich man  doesnt deliver endless  clever  monologues to his friends about his favourite types of boots    
in short  these guys are just riffing on other movies  and in doing that  making the same film over and over and over again  
tarantino found his niche and now hundreds of genxers with movie cameras are trying to find tarantinos niche instead of carving their own

0	"it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of todays movies or novels  you must suspend disbelief   
however  there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies  
it came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg  indiana  where the film is set   does not have a mcdonalds  a sears store  a statue of a man on a horse  nor even a dam close by  
even if you can ignore these somewhat white lies  even though the dam is crucial to hard rains plot   there is still a bunch of things that just dont gel  
firstly  morgan freeman  possibly the greatest actor alive  after such films as driving miss daisy  the shawshank redemption and se7en   was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement  
he should have played the town sheriff  an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman  
as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg  its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases  
i say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them  and it seems a tad strange that an entire town  with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way  can vanish before the flood has actually started  
but nether the less  armored guard couriers tom  christian slater  and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van  
with a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads  it doesnt take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road  
jim  morgan freeman  and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars  
but of course tom is more than willing to save the day  so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town  
the local sheriff  randy quaid  whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4  and a couple of police men investigate the situation  but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what heshe would do with their share of the three million dollars  
director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsyturvy  and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite goodies versus baddies   there are numerous twists in its plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience  
but by the time these interesting changes occur  its far too late in the film for them to have much affect  
hard rains continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had  and although its cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par  
not at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman  we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected  
such titles as broken arrow  slater and john travolta  and faceoff  nicholas cage and john travolta  come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations  
strangely enough  they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta  
we can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre  but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character  
if you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow  my answer would have been a definite no  
i now know that he has no excuse  and can do better  if you dont believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store   
although hard rain never really works from the start  i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen  
the addition of an enticing subplot would have given the film time to breathe  rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that cant handle anything else  
despite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account  if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film  
no creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors  but it doesnt really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about 8  50 is compare this to other films

1	"near the end of frank capras holiday classic  its a wonderful life  george bailey  jimmy stewart  is feeling down  
he has devoted his life to others  and never fulfilled his dream of leaving his small supburb town  bedford falls  
standing upon a bridge above stormy waters  he looks down  contemplating suicide  
he has potential he hasnt fulfilled  yet  he has done so much for others  
as a young chap  his ambition was to leave his hometown of bedford falls  
but times and ambitions change  
things happen  and hes stuck  
his guardian angel is there  and shows him that    its 
a wonderful life  
in a whirlwind tour of the town  george sees what life would be like without him  
he learns the moral lesson  that to live is a gift  
his earthly problems are solved  
the climatic scene is a marvel  
frank capras film is a centenial classic  watched and reexperienced by every generation  
wonderful life is one of the few pictures of times gone by that seems as fresh  maybe fresher  then it did when it was first released  
many films of the thirties through seventies have aged poorly  
but this one is a near flawless example of how well a perfect script and timing can mesh with firstrate acting  wit and suspense  glorious music  and terrific set peices  
the only even slightly dated scenes are those at the begining in which god has a long chat with clarence  georges guardian angel  
they arent all that bad  but they remain corny and a little out of place  
nevertheless  this is one film that deserves its place in time  cinema history  and our hearts  
it can be equally appreciated by anyone of any age  
here is one genuine masterpeice  a classic that reaches heights and ambitions near perfection  
this crackling good mixture results in a film which is at once funny  exciting  moving and uplifting  
the film itself is almost a reversal of the life of george bailey  there isnt too much to it  but capra and the gang  various screenwriters  composers  actors  plumet the material to its fullest potential  
the result is a film  though not at first intended to be pigeonholed as a holiday film  that will always be remembered  celebrated  and loved

this is a laughable 1977 rip off of king kong  1976   itself a ripoff  
production values are low and audiences seem to like the film mostly for derisive laughter  
  high 2  4 to 4  
 directed by ho menghua  
 this film is provided to be a sort of laughing stock to finish the festival  
 an earthquake uncovers an 11story tall gorilla in the himalayas  
a hunter  chosen because he just broke up with his girl and is at loose ends  gets sent to find the ape and finds a sort of female tarzan who controls the ape  
 evelyne kraft is the jungle girl in a leather bikini that she is pasted into so she always looks on the verge of bouncing out of  
 gorilla actor has no idea how gorillas move and suit is terrible  
nice miniature effects  however  
 has almost a music video inside it of jungle girl playing with animals like chichi the leopard  
 several places there is narrative that is nearly incoherent as if there are missing scenes and the viewer has to guess what happened in the interim  
 actual location shooting in mysore  
ape shown badly matted behind temple  
 combining of images usually pretty bad  
incompetent matching of film stocks  
 stock footage frequently used  
 gorilla brought to hong kong by greedy entrepreneur who really abuses the ape before it escapes and tears things up real good

1	"krippendorfs tribe is a formula comedy  
done poorly  formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema  
however  every now and then  one emerges  like krippendorfs tribe  that actually works  
professor james krippendorf  richard dreyfuss   the renowned anthropologist  is in trouble  
his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea  
however  he found    nothing  
his wife has recently died  and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids  shelly  natasha lyonne   mickey  gregory smith  and edmund  carl michael lidner   
tonight  he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe  
rather than break the news  and face the consequences of misusing his funds   he invents a tribe  the shelmikedmu  named after his kids   
however  one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu  but his research becomes a popular phenomenon  
soon  professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members  
his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an overeager colleague  veronica micelli  jenna elfman   and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist  ruth allen  lily tomlin   
krippendorfs tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief  
no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras  or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes  
luckily  as the film builds momentum  that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by  
though theres some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe  the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies  
the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable  and the comic timing required for some of the films latter scenes is superb  
richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe  
jenna elfmans position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times  but she plays the part with extreme affability  
even the kids  who in films like this tend to be a bit on the precocious side  are endearing and humorous  
yes  the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor  but it has the best excuse of all  its funny  
it may not go down as an alltime classic  but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy  plenty of laughs

0	"    the following review contains spoilers    
  its just    
the way    
we are   
 a rapist  matt frewer  responds to supergirls  helen slater  query as to why shes being attacked  an example of the mindnumbingly bad dialogue in supergirl  
ill admit it    
i love superman iii  
i know its hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor  but i still think its a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise  
supergirl  a spinoff film of sorts from the series same producers  alexander and ilya salkind   doesnt even rival superman iii in terms of quality  let alone superman or superman ii  
supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time  
as the film begins we see the residents of argo city  a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in  inner space   go about their daily lives  
ok    
what  
so these are exiles from krypton  which blew up right  
were they living there before krypton exploded  
how do you get to  inner space   
this whole  inner space  notion is never explained  particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world  
how do they know where superman went  
how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet  
these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me  
argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron  
one day the founder of argo city  zaltar  peter o toole   gives the omegahedron to supermans cousin  kara  helen slater   for use as inspiration in her art  
kara uses it to create a buglike thing which immediately crashes through the layer of  whatever  that protects the city  
in the chaos  the omegahedron sails out through the opening  dooming the argonians to death    
in three days time  or something  
kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world  
the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minorleague witch named selena  faye dunaway  who  immediately before her dip was ruined  announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel  peter cook   
selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans  and she sets out to achieve world domination  
selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth  and that shes arrived as supergirl  complete with appropriate costume   
supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives  
ok    
huh  
why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake  
attention movie  explain yourself  
im sorry  i can only suspend disbelief so much  
i cant buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to  
knowing that she needs a secret identity  supergirl basically  wills  herself into a school girl outfit  complete with a different hairstyle   picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school  
shes given her dorm assignment  and who happens to be her roommate  
lois lanes sister  lucy  
ok  coincidence is one thing folks  but were getting really contrived now  
what follows are some generic allgirls school hijinks    
complete with evil bully girls  mean for no reason  of course  and even a shower scene     
best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks  
at this point im rapidly wondering why im bothering with this nonsense  
there is some credit to give to the film however  
one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an  evil  bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its  prey  is very well done  
also  its commendable to see genders reversed in the film  whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools  
hart bochner  die hard  is particularly fun as karas love interest  a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena  although he is unfortunately part of one of the films more ridiculous moments  when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some  menacing  bumper cars   
then there were numerous little things that bothered me  
the flying effects are never convincing for a moment    
its all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires  
instead of having her look like shes flying  the filmmakers wanted her to be  graceful   so she poses a lot and does ballettype maneuvers  
also  who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth  
a pair of truck driversrapists who immediately attack her and then meet a  wacky  demise  
there is also some rampant product placement in the film  most notably for popeyes  tylenol  and aw root beer  with the latter actually putting its logo on the tshirt of one of the rapists      
finally  just one word  monsters  
faye dunaway and peter otoole ham it up unmercifully  however when otoole overacts hes entertaining and when dunaway does it shes annoying  her character actually says the line  seize them   
at one point   
dunaways henchmen  played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro  fare much better  with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beattys otis character from the first two superman movies  
helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent  naive character shes written to be  as shes able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable  
believability aside though  its still annoying  
now despite all this negativity  and im not alone here    supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles   leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested  but excited about its release on dvd  
they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd  to the delight of many people  including myself    
yet im still unclear as to why  since this movie is so awful   
the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u  s  theaters  
the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2  35  1  is enhanced for 16x9 televisions  and has been remastered in full thx glory  
extras on the disc include  a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and  special project consultant  scott michael bosco  the excellent 50minute documentary from 1984 called supergirlthe making of a feature  dig that workout montage    5 trailers  3 tv spots  talent bios  indepth storyboards  accompanied by score from the movie   and assorted still galleries  
the transfer on this international version is incredible    
youd think you were watching a new release  
images are sharp  colors jump off the screen  and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts  
only some special effects sequences show the wear of time  and there just isnt much that can be done about that  unless youre obsessive like george lucas   
the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places  however youll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score  which is completely unrelated to john williams classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films golanglobus production   
the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries  
bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that theres no dead air on the track  
bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen  and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation  
although  at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc  and is surprised when he doesnt get that response  
we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track  most notably the  almost  appearance in the film by christopher reeve  
great detail is given about supermans proposed role in the original script before reeve  wisely  dropped out  
as it stands  superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission  
for the sake of brevity  i wont even get into that one  
szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds  and everyone else agreed  that supergirl needed to stand on its own  replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy  whimsical fantasy  nonsense  
bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along  claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office  
again  for the sake of brevity  i wont even get into that one  
anchor bay has also released a limited edition  only 50  000 copies pressed  twodisc set  
disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release  
disc two features the never before seen directors cut of the film  which runs 138 minutes long  
the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which dont add much of note  except for a few moments which lengthen peter otooles screen time  particularly during his latter appearances   
the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono  but fans of the film wont care  
one question though    
shouldnt the directors commentary be on the directors cut of the film  
id never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd  
i was nine when it was released to theaters  and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it  
so when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect  
i knew the film wasnt beloved and i never had any interest in it before  but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc  
as the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence  which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong  
come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo    
so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started  
at the end of the film  supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron  and flies back to argo city  
ugh  i give up  
im surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once  not twice  but three times to review these discs  
supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package  but a very lousy movie

you think you know all about vampires    believe 
me    you 
know f  ck all   
with these words  we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver  played by eileen daly   
made into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake  she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being  
so  whats an undead girl to do  except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible  get out her guns  seduce a few guys  and kill a few people for money and blood  
with that out of the way  let me say this  
this film is bad  
this film is really  really bad  
yet somehow  it is strangely enjoyable  
with all the elements of a direct to video horror flick  buxom babes  gore  cheesy dialogue  and bad acting  any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade  
still  it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film  
agreed  it might be  but is far from being the best vampire flick ever  
period  
razor blade smile has some rather high production values  shown by the nice overall tone to the film  
the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore  with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating  doesnt sleep in a coffin  but leaves one next to her computer   and sees religion as the opium of the peoples  hence  immunity to crosses   
but aside from that  it doesnt stray too far away from horror film conventions  
that is  unless that is intentional  
razor blade smile literally goes for the throat  then pumps the wound full of processed cheese  
you cant help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed head goes flying into a puddle  
youll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations  to distract two female guards  lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number   
youll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably  
and then  theres the sudden twist ending  i have enough heart not to give it away   
the film refuses to take itself seriously  which is a good thing  as by the time lilith zips up her skintight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage  youve most likely forgotten the main point of the story  
but in case you really care  shes been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the socalled illuminati  and shes leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find  
as much as my criticisms  this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups  
almost destined for cultstatus  the films campy  cheesy overtones actually work towards the film  
while this may not necessarily be the film youd want to be seen watching by yourself  it makes for a fun time at the movies

0	"synopsis  the president of a company wants to test his selfappointed successor  whos psychotic  and thinks its a great idea to spend a week with him and their wives in an isolated cabin a hundred miles from civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication after a heavy snowfall  
comments  tracks of a killer had a couple of strikes against it before i even began watching it  
strike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotapes sticker in black marker  not typically a good sign when you rent a film   
strike two came while the previews played  
did you ever get a sinking premonition about a movies quality  or lack thereof  while watching the trailers that come before it  
well  the cheesy films being advertised before tracks of a killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring people no one knows  and they all looked bad  definately not a good sign   
tracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout  
about the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery  
to be fair  the first halfhour or so promises at least a watchable thriller  
wolf larson  who bears more than a passing resemblance to hugh grant  adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the films title  
james brolin and kelly lebrock seem equally adequate as the loving couple larson will later threaten  
brolins character  for some inexplicable reason  thinks its a great idea to spend some time in a cabin  practically isolated  with lebrock and larson  whom hes decided to test for the week before giving him full control of his company  
by the time the characters arrive at the cabin  this film begins to become tedious  
apparently  brolins successors test involves chopping wood for the fireplace and skiing  which dont seem like attributes necessary to run a business in the city  
but  then again  what do i know about business  
i do think  though  that they should have invested in some better furniture for the cabin  its beds and closets have a habit of just breaking at the slightest touch  
larsons character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he wants to kill  
this leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three characters  which really isnt enough to sustain it  
the films writer must have taken a cue from stephen king  as scenes from tracks of a killer seem lifted out of misery and geralds game  
larson and lebrock fight and torture each other  the tables get turned a couple of times  while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help  
some old guys around too  just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple  who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film  
the old guy  however  miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous its worthy of a chuckle or two  
outside of that chuckle  unfortunately  tracks of a killer will just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors  for some reason  become increasing obnoxious  
if youre in a video store and thinking about renting this turkey  dont  
make tracks to a far superior suspense film  like misery

1	"it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a lessthansavoury character as mel gibson does in payback  
of course  if i was being paid 25 million for one months work  id probably be willing to take risks as well  but thats neither here nor there  
payback is based on a novel by richard stark  apparently actually donald e  westlake  author of the grifters  itself a fine crime film  which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys  lee marvin  
the film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back  by whom we dont know yet  
all we know is that gibson  as porter  isnt a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back  and getting even in the process  no matter what the consequences  
it turns out that the man hes after is val  gregg henry   his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters  
obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul  val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers  
porter  however  is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet  goes about exacting revenge on the doublecrossing val  
gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play  that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesnt mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants  
you probably wouldnt see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat  outofcharacter role such as porter  jim carrey wont be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried  the cable guy  anyone    
harrison fords idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent  the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin  which we wont mention further  and has stallone ever really played a villain at all  
this is not to say that porter is a villain  per se  
while he isnt the sort of character you wouldnt want to get on the wrong side of  hes nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their righthand men just to prove how mean they are  
porter is only trying to get back what is notsorightfully his  which in a way is almost understandable  
payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedythriller which wont be remembered as being among gibsons most important work  but is still one of the finer films hes done  
the only real problem with it is that  while everything seems to work out in the end  i was left feeling something was lacking  was that all  
the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute  and the final voiceover doesnt ring true  even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the filmnoir style the rest of the film embodies  
the film just ends far too suddenly  after a huge buildup in the penultimate scenes  
a fine film  even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation  
just be ready for a possible letdown of an ending

1	"gordon fleming  peter mullan  is in a bind  
he has a new  unexpected baby and his business  hazardous material removal  is in danger of going under  
when he and his crew get a job opportunity at the longabandoned danvers state hospital  he underbids the competition to secure the contract and promises to get the threeweek job done in one  
it will prove to be a fateful week for them all in  session 9   
gordo gets the job to remove asbestos and other hazardous materials from the spooky old mental hospital in preparation for relocating town offices there  
their guided tour of the facility by a local official  bill giggs  paul guilfoyle   brings them through some of the creepier parts of the former asylum  
but  a job is a job and  if they finish in a week  as promised  there is a 10000 bonus in store  
as they get down to their work  things  normal and not so normal  begin to happen  
gordon hears a disembodied voice beckoning him  
phil  david caruso  is conflicted working with a guy  hank  josh lucas   who is seeing his old girlfriend  
mike  coscreenwriter steven gevedon  has discovered a cache of audiotapes and transcripts from old psychiatric sessions  hence  the title  with inmate mary hobbs  a multipersonality patient with a dark secret  
gordos nephew  jeff  brendan sexton iii   suffers from night phobia and is afraid to venture into the dark bowels of the hospital  
as the agreed upon week draws to an end  hank mysteriously disappears from the workplace after a nocturnal confrontation with someone  something   in the hospital  
tensions mount and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chance for the bonus start to slip away  
but  there is more  much more  at stake as the hospital and its history of insanity weigh on them all  
i dont want to give away too much of the story of  session 9   so ill stop there  
what we have here is a spooky horror flick that uses none of the jumpoutatyoufromthedark cheap shots that have become part and parcel with horror films since the advent of  halloween  and  friday the thirteenth   
there is no cat leaping out of the dark or the shock of suddenly seeing oneself in a strategically placed mirror  
with the exception of one shadowy and chilling image at one point spooky interlude in the film  there is little that you can get your arms around as far as what  specifically  is  frightening   
as i watched  session 9  i became aware of the subtle things that built up during the story that make it a true horror movie  
the striking highdefinition video camera work by uta briesewitz  who worked with the director  brad anderson  on his  next stop wonderland   helps to build up tension with closeups  fluid camera movement and odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud  
music  too  is used to intense effect  joining with the camera to make simple scenes frightening  even horrifying  
couple these tech feats with an intelligent story that uses elements of  the shining    the blair witch project  and  even  the texas chainsaw massacre  and you get a decent  intriguing horror flick  
additionally  the brilliant decision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film another starring character  the institution itself  which lends even more chills to the equation  
acting is another factor that raises  session 9  above the usual dreck presented in recent horror hits like  scream    i know what you did last summer  and their sequels  
those films took goodlooking  though generic  young actors and actresses and put them to use to build up a body count  substituting mayhem for real horror  
anderson opted  instead  to use mature  experienced actors like peter mullan and david caruso to fill his characters shoes and the difference in casting quality is notable  
mullan  in particular  puts an arc on his character  gordon  as the troubled guy who slowly and inexorably falls under the pressures of family  job and  finally  danvers state hospital  
the rest of the small cast fit the bill as people  not just fodder for the mayhem  
david caruso  as gordos senior man and near equal in the business  shows just how good an actor he is  
he made the jump from tvs  nypd blue  to film far too soon and his decisions in the roles he took  ill never forget the horrendous  jade   were less than star making  
he rolls his sleeves up and does the job well here  
gevedon  lucas and sexton are more than fodder  too  
the only problem with  session 9  lay in the uninspired ending  
it takes on a fairly conventional finale that covers old ground and is a bit of a disappointment after the terrific  and inspired  build up  
the pleasure is getting there and i wish that anderson and gevedon had kept up the steam they had so ably built during the bulk of the film 
  session 9  is an unusual feat  
it is scary  doesnt use cheap tricks and raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered  subtle horror  
because of the local interest of danvers  it should do well with the northeast crowd  
i hope it gets the national distribution it deserves  
i give it a b  
"
0	"to sum the entire film  54  up in one sentence  it would be  watch a vh1 documentary instead  
  54   seems like someone brought william faulkner into 1978  brought him into studio 54  got him really drunk  told him to write about it  and then dumbed that down to be released to the public  
a sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex  drugs  and disco  
the narrator  shane oshae  ryan phillippe   works as a grease monkey in new jersey who  of course  on a whim decides to go into new york and try to get into studio  54   
phillippe gives a passable performance which could have been made by any young  attractive actor with a six pack stomach  
he is let in by steve rubbell  mike myers   the infamous coowner of studio 54  because he is attractive  
he eventually becomes a bus boy and then a bartender  
  
  
you expected more  didnt you  
there isnt  
the film builds up from nothing and becomes nothing as its climax  isnt that an apt word for studio 54  lands with a thud  
the glitz of the club and perpetually semiclothed patrons are used in an to attempt to show the its glamour  
for much of its target audience  college age to early thirties  it attempts to show celebrities mixing with  normal people   
this even fails since the only two celebs truly introduced are andy warhol and truman capote  
you can be sure that half of the audience hasnt heard of them  another quarter only know their names  and the other quarter knew they were there already  
the humor  if you can call it that  is built on an eighty year old woman getting high and 70s references like john travolta and olivia newton john making us laugh at how stupid we were back then 
the best performance in the film is given by mike myers as the perpetually high  sexually ambivlaent  very new york steve rubell  
he seems to play rubell better than rubell would if he was still alive  
he looks like rubell and sounds just like him while giving a subdued  almost nostalgic performance  when needed  
it reminds you of his saturday night live character linda richmond on  coffee talk  sans dress and wig  
the supporting cast of salma hayek  breckin meyer  and neve cambell are their only there to give added subplots which are introduced but lead absolutely nowhere  
the romance between phillippe and cambell  as a soap opera star  is completely implausable  
the two share about half as much screen time as there are shots of the eighty year old hooked on amphetimenes  
hayeks wannabe singer seems extremely forced and her husband  greg  meyer  stands in as shane oshaes surrogate best friend  
the subplots seemed forced and seem like they have been added just to make sure the film was over an hour and a half long  
overall   54  tried to give a view of the brashness of the place where crack flowed like heroin which flowed like wine  
the film never leads to anything  has no obserable point  and covers up a lack of real plot with a veil of beautiful people  
in truth  that reminded me of the eighies  
"
0	"capsule  combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark  a dash of a jackie chan movie  sans jackie   two teaspoons of gun and swordplay  and a dollop of cgi  
simmer for 100 minutes  
yields  zilch  
the phantom is a depressing and tired retread of so many earlier  better movies that after the fifteenminute mark i started cataloguing them out loud  
its hard to make a good actionadventure movie that doesnt simply recycle its predecessors  and ive seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully  
the phantom  allegedly based on the longrunning comic of the same name  doesnt even bother to be graceful  
its a stupid and incompetent movie in too many ways to list  but ill try  
the film opens up with a  prelude  sequence that looks like it was slashed to ribbons in the editing and then given a heavy voiceover to compensate for whatever got thrown out  
we go from there to a jungle sequence that  i swear to god  recycles the truckchase scene from raiders of the lost ark notefornote  possibly even shotforshot  right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door and slung one of the drivers out into the brush  and then goes on to rip off the ropebridge scene from  sorcerer  as well  
sorcerer  as you may well remember  was a remake of a french movie  the wages of fear  in which a bunch of lowlifes were paid piles of money to drive a truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain  
both versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick  but ive got my job to do  so back to the salt mines we go  
anyway  the cinematic theft doesnt stop there  
or at least the lack of inspiration  
there isnt a single thing here we havent seen  and its not given to us in a way that remotely evokes our interest  
we have  wheres my list   
a bad girl  a tough good girl  a secret cave hideaway  which seems inspired more by dr  
no than anything else   a boardroom meeting that drips with greed and venality  magical artifacts of terrible power  and caryhiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets to wear a fu manchu mustache and sneer a lot and generally humiliate himself  
what else is there  
the plot is a waste of time  
the sets alternate between big but hokey  and tiny and still hokey  
there are lines in the script that are just begging to be mst3ked  and im sure once mike and the bots get the cash  theyll stick it on their sked  
the only thing in the movie worth noting is billy zane  hes a good actor  and he tries very hard  even when the script is sending him down one dead alley of a scene after another  
all i can say is that i pray this isnt the beginning of the end for him  although it sure looks like the final nail in the coffin for the comicbook superhero movie  
"
1	"films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success  whether theyre about superheroes  batman  superman  spawn   or geared toward kids  casper  or the arthouse crowd  ghost world   but theres never really been a comic book like from hell before  
for starters  it was created by alan moore  and eddie campbell   who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid 80s with a 12part series called the watchmen  
to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd  
the book  or  graphic novel   if you will  is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes  
in other words  dont dismiss this film because of its source  
if you can get past the whole comic book thing  you might find another stumbling block in from hells directors  albert and allen hughes  
getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in  well  anything  but riddle me this  who better to direct a film thats set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society  
the ghetto in question is  of course  whitechapel in 1888 londons east end  
its a filthy  sooty place where the whores  called  unfortunates   are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision  
when the first stiff turns up  copper peter godley  robbie coltrane  the world is not enough  calls in inspector frederick abberline  johnny depp  blow  to crack the case  
abberline  a widower  has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium  
upon arriving in whitechapel  he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly  heather graham  say it isnt so  and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon cant stomach  
i dont think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper  so i wont go into the particulars here  other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay  
in the comic  they dont bother cloaking the identity of the ripper  but screenwriters terry hayes  vertical limit  and rafael yglesias  les mis  rables  do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end  
its funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because  after all  an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts  
and from hells ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days   who holds back the electric carwho made steve guttenberg a star     
dont worry  itll all make sense when you see it  
now onto from hells appearance  its certainly dark and bleak enough  and its surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did  at times  it seems like sleepy hollow 2   
the print i saw wasnt completely finished  both color and music had not been finalized  so no comments about marilyn manson   but cinematographer peter deming  dont say a word  ably captures the dreariness of victorianera london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks  even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the blackandwhite comic  
oscar winner martin childs  shakespeare in love  production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place  
even the acting in from hell is solid  with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent  
ians holm  joe goulds secret  and richardson  102 dalmatians  log in great supporting roles  but the big surprise here is graham  
i cringed the first time she opened her mouth  imagining her attempt at an irish accent  but it actually wasnt half bad  
the film  however  is all good  
2  00  r for strong violencegore  sexuality  language and drug content

0	"my giant begins with a monologue thats more funny than not and a distinctive princess bride   medieval fairytaleinthe  90s feel  
i was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was  with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy  billy crystal  is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream  
and when sammy meets max  his giant  mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan  there is magic in the air  albeit it a bit goofy  i loved every minute of it  
the film  of course  plays on the size difference between the two  and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects  
i particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a maxsized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons  
i also liked jere burns  from tvs something so right  performance as the director of the film in romania  
at this point  the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand  particularly during his fastpaced first scene  
it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate  as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech  
however  about the time muresan becomes coherent  the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive  
off the high board  
suddenly  we are expected to believe sammy is a dowhateverittakes slime ball  
up until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure  but he didnt come off as a desperate jerk  
if he had  the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical  
but now  in new york  we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son  and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs  midgets wrestling match  which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film  
indeed  many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces  
this includes the scenes featuring steven seagal  when sammy gets max a role in a big  hollywood movie filming in las vegas  
while i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself  the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation  rather than because the film demanded it  
and the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare  
at this point i found myself thinking  were supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film   
then i realized he was  and i was watching it  
in the final third  the film undergoes another transformation  this time to unbridled sentimentality  
note  major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph  
max went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love  lillianna  who hasnt seen him since he was a normalsized kid  
her refusal to see max  unbeknownst to him  leads us to an awkward ends justify the means scene as sammys wife serena  played nicely by kathleen quinlan  poses as lillianna  
i found this scene offensive  
not only did it rely on deception to induce warm  fuzzy feelings from the audience  it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle  which i thought was quite undeserved  
i think max could have handled the truth  gratuitous illness and all  
late in the film we learn max  and in fact all giants  have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably  
this could be an enlightening revelation  but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammys transformation into a caring  sensitive guy  and hey  a great dad and husband  too  
my giant suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions  
a stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on maxs struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammys struggles to get money and become a better person  
in this scenario  maxs illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator  
sentiment and emotion would have followed naturally  
instead  were apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end  but were not allowed to focus on max  
crystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances  but in the end  my giant left me feeling like id been fed gruel from a giant spoon  
"
1	"there was a lot riding on this movie  
everyone even moderately interested in the  scream  series was dying to know how it would end  
what would be the  final act   
this is the end of an era for them  a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet  talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies  and  for kids under 17  those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into  scream  while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves  
no need to worry   scream 3  is endlessly inventive and entertaining  a fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson a household name  reinvented the horror genre  and continued in the selfreferential  postmodern tradition of quentin and co  
so  how does the story go  
as opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe  sidney prescott  neve campbell   now allgrownup and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche  is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress  but rather in upstate california  living  understandably  alone in the confines of fences and vast security systems  
she works at home as a crisis center affiliate over the phone  
but that    s not where the movie starts off  
instead  in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar  and conceptually horrifying  sequence in  eye for an eye   1995   cotton weary  liev schreiber   now a big star  drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls  demands the location of sidney    s home  and  when he doesn    t get it  threatens the life of cotton    s girlfriend christine  and cotton can    t do anything to stop him  
the rest of the sequence is particularly clever  setting up a constant throughout the picture  the killer has a hightech electronic voicechanger that tops that of the first two  
not only does he sound unmistakably like talented voiceover artist roger jackson  ha  ha   he can now easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters  including sidney  and the returned gale weathers  courtney cox arquette  and dewey riley  david arquette   
at the same time  stab 3  the third filmwithinafilm based around the characters and events of woodsboro and windsor college  has taken a less authentic approach this time around in return to woodsboro  whereas the account of the first two films was true  the franchise within  scream  has now become totally fictional  
nevertheless  we learn  cotton made an appearance in the movie which is now in production  as himself to be killed off in the first scene  
so  it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in which they bite it in the movie   either the actor portraying them  or the real thing  
sometimes both  
clever  indeed  
but  who goes next  
no one knows  
three different scripts were penned  we    re told  to keep the true finale off the internet  a nod to the  scream  2 fiasco a few years back  and no one knows for sure which one the killer read  
still  all the while sidney stays concealed in her home  only visiting dad for the first halfhour of the film  while also having horrifying visions of her mother  which takes us back a bit to sidney    s fear of becoming what her mother was   or  at least  what her mother was secretly  
when sidney finally ventures out to hollywood as the murders become more prevalent  she    s chased onto the set of stab 3  wandering through  woodsboro   written and directed as an odd  surreal  nightmare indeed  this is one of  scream 3     s finest moments  
okay  over the years  i    ll admit that i    ve become quite the  scream  fan  
no  i don    t have the ghostface costume or the director    s cut laserdisc  but i often find myself compelled to pop in the dvd of either member of the preceding duo  and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these films  yes  i said  dramatic element    sometimes debating with family and friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated with  scream   
throughout the film  though  i noticed a much more subtle approach than the other two films  
granted that there    s stabbinaplenty going on throughout  but there    s considerably less blood  less gore  
honestly  i like this approach  
it    s more classical  more rebellious  constantly demonstrating the capable direction of wes craven  
he knows when to hold back and at the same time makes the movie ooze with energy  illustrating the delicate poise flowing from his years of experience  
some critics have noted that  scream 3  seems to take itself more seriously this time  maybe so  or maybe screenwriter ehren kruger  arlington road   who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts  saw an opportunity for true irony   maybe even a little bit of satire   if the film worked in a few more clich   s  
what puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional and creative film  i    m afraid  is the ending  or  rather  the identity of the killer  
it does the job  i guess  accomplishes what it should  bringing the three films full circle  but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a little too contrived  too arbitrary  after a second viewing  which i endeavored upon due to this recurring disapprobation  the killer    s identity still seems a little too random  but his motivation came across more sound this time around  and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying  
all in all   scream 3  does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of a trilogy  it is not the worst of the films  
as a trilogy   scream  was a lot of fun  refreshing  humorous  offbeat  
almost sad to see it go  
but then  it does seem best to quit while you    re ahead  and  scream 3  does a fine job of providing closure to its characters  
for now   scream  holds the title as the finest series of horror films to be committed to celluloid  
not too shabby

0	"there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of  scream queen  in the early 80s  
two of them were halloween movies  but the other two  prom night and terror train  were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween  
the same  god  im scared  theres some guy in a mask coming after me  routine she did in john carpenters classic  jamie lee copies here  with none of the urgency or suspense  
terror train takes place on  where else   a train  charted by some premed students finishing their first four years of higher education  
most of them wont make it to med school  though  and its obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains   i wish to hell theyd put a radio on that train   
the conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone  even jamie lee  
from the beginning  hes talking his head off  he tells one of his coworkers  think on this  whens the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station   
as if it makes any kind of sense  and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles  
of course  the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find a bloody body  which is then gone when he brings a skeptical trainman back to view it  
i forgot to mention the prologue  
its a party three years earlier  with the same group of students  
two of them play a trick on a geeky frat pledge  promising him hes going to get laid  
they send jamie lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes in  noticing a form on the bed  
she says   kiss me  kenny   and he kisses the body on the bed  which happens to be a cadaver  
   oh my god  they killed kenny  
you bastards    
its a sick trick  and one jamie lee wasnt let in on  
she still hasnt forgiven the guy as they board the terror train   you asshole  you cant have a good time without hurting somebody     
the killing starts before the train even leaves the station  
since its new years  everyones wearing disguises  a convenient plot device weve seen before   and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no ones looking  
at least one of the characters says its a groucho mask  when the killer dons it and steps aboard  it looks like gene shalit who  by the way  would make a great killer in a slasher movie  
speaking of weirdlooking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene  one of terror trains most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield  as the magician   who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music  
then theres his greatest trick  getting laid with hair that looks like that  
for all its attempts at visual style and substance  terror train is more lionel than amtrak  more prom night than halloween  and nothing really worth watching  
only diehard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield  if he truly has any fans  should even attempt to watch it  
and it makes me wonder if a horror movie set in an rv could be much worse  
i mean  when was the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station  anyway  
terror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car

bette midler and dennis farina play lilly and dan  actress and author  once married  now violently divorced  and back together one last time for their daughter mollys  paula marshall  wedding  
lilly and dan hate each other passionately  so passionately that they have sex at the wedding and fall in love again  
each ditches his or her current spouse of 14 years and runs off with the other  
molly  married now only 24 hours  runs off in search of her irresponsible parents while her husband keith  jamie denton  tries to console the abandoned spouses  
in mollys search for her parents  she somehow falls in love with lillys paparazzo joey  danny nucci   
meanwhile  the newlywed keith ends up consoling dans wife rowena  gail ogrady  in bed  
the audience i saw this with apparently thought that all the adultery was hilarious  
im no dan quayle  but i thought it was a bit creepy  
the message seemed to be  ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly and have fun fucking who you wish   
  family values  aside  theres something cruel about all this  
perhaps this movie would have played well as a black comedy  but the movie is a romantic comedy  
we are supposed to be rooting for these creeps  
reiner and screenwriter leslie dixon tried to make it easier on us by making the victims unlikeable  
lillys husband is a newage flake who rambles about  emotional valet parking   so we can write him off as irrelevant  
dans wife is vain  manipulative  and jealous so we can write her off as a bitch  
mollys husband is a careerconscious  selfcentered republican politician who thinks shes too fat  and just for good measure  he also fucked dans wife   so we can write him off as a prick  
everyone else falls in love  
but still  that somehow doesnt justify the actions of the movies main characters  
  hes a prick  or  shes a bitch  is no defense  
the movie is somewhat redeemed by some funny dialog  often during heated arguments  and by aboveaverage performances by midler and farina  breaking out of his characteractor mold   
other than that  its a standard romantic comedy with a very substandard gimmick

aaaaaaaaah  
then one day  she sees him knock a woman upside the head with a baseball bat  
ooooooooh  
she must then join together with her modelfriends to find out whether or not this guy is really goofybutloveable  or a psycho killer  
aaaaaaaaah  
critique  completely idiotic  
okay  so maybe im being a little too nice  
this movie starts off dumb  moves into the ridiculous and eventually graduates to idiocy  
there    thats 
more like it  
and how  you may ask  
well  its simple really  
four of the dumbest stereotypical models in the world  oh my god  i just found out that the actresses playing the parts are models in real life    yipes   
join monica potter  in a role which can only be described as an obvious cry for help  and freddie prinze jr   not the actor  but the character better known as freddie prinze jr    in a plot so stupid and farfetched  that you have to wonder once more  how crap like this gets by the hollywood bigwigs  
this thing stinks to highheaven  
its just plain embarrassing for everyone involved  
i even felt my iq dip below its usual low as toilet humor somehow worked its way into this socalled romanticcomedyaction movie  
ugh  
what a pile of dung  
hey  im actually starting to sound a little like harry knowles here  but i guess i could see where his frustration comes from time to time  
its sad really  
a movie which actually had quite a few people in my audience laughing at its idiocy  including the overused  folks hiding in the bathroom while someone else comes in to take a crap and fart  gag  
and how about that dumb blonde model who keeps running into things  
pure hilarity  
or maybe im just too jaded  too much of a critic  not relaxed enough to enjoy this fluffpiece    uuuhhmmm    naaaaah   
this movie sucks the big one  
its chockfull of stupid characters delivering inane dialogue fitting snuggly into a preposterous plot  
this is the kind of movie that has one character inserting another character into a car headfirst to the floor only because    well  
its supposed to be funny  see  
you see  that person then has their legs swinging in the other persons face as they drive and that distracts the driver  see  and well  thats kinda funny  no  
harumph    yeah  
well    you 
get the picture  
anyhoo  freddie prinze jr     nuff 
said  
monica potter  a bad career move  but we might forgive you if you keep up the julia roberts bit  
the rest of the model girls    well  
thanks for being there so i had something to look at  but please apologize to the entire modeling community as a whole  for making them all out to be complete imbeciles   
so why the three points out of ten  you may ask  
well  its simple really  
one point goes to the russian model girl and that cool accent  dont ask me why  but it actually turned me on   
one point goes out to all of the model girls for being in the movie  nice window decoration    natch    
and one last point goes out to the makers of this film  who spared us any long sorted story  and made sure to give us the opportunity of leaving the theatre after only 90 minutes of manufactured garbage  so that we could run out as fast as we can  grab the next person that we see walking down the street and warn them of the devil that is    freddie prinze jr    i 
mean  head over heels  
youve been warned  good people  
ps  didja notice how i didnt even mention rear window once in my entire review  
i didnt want to taint the memory of the classic flick by having it uttered alongside this thing  but then again  i just did mention it  but i guess it doesnt count in the ps section    or

1	"bruce willis stars as malcolm  an award winning child psychologist who discovers one night that one of his former patients is still suffering from inner demons  
the now grown man breaks into his apartment while he and his wife  olivia williams from rushmore  are celebrating his award  shoots malcolm in the stomach  then takes his own life  
almost nine months later  malcolm discovers cole  haley joel osment  in a brilliant performance   another young man afflicted with the same turmoil as his former patient  
he takes on the childs case in the hope of redeeming himself for botching up the previous one  alienating his wife in the process  
he soon discovers that they boy can see and speak to the dead  and his life becomes forever turned upside down  
although the first hour is very slow  the sixth sense turns out to be a very powerful and moving film  
i was expecting this film to be mercury rising 2  but was astonished to discover an extremely well plotted out little thriller with an outstandingly satisfying ending  
youll find yourself mentally retracing your steps through the film to see if you actually saw what you think you did once the credits roll  
i must give m  night shyamalan a lot of credit for a brilliantly written screenplay  
the cast should also be given a lot of credit for making the movie as solid as it is  
a lesser cast could have made this film a joke  
bruce willis portrays his character perfectly  balancing his need to help cole and his agony over his strained relationship with his wife skillfully  
haley joel osment shines as nine year old cole  showing patience in his character that few young actors these days can pull off  
toni collette  looking markedly different from her pathetic character in muriels wedding  gives a strong performance as coles mother  who is trying to cope with both her sons  illness  and the passing of her mother  
finally  olivia williams deftly portrays a woman having to struggle with a husband whos not around and flirtations with a coworker that could lead to a begrudgingly accepted end  
its a shame that they show coles abilities in the trailer  because the movie takes close to forty minutes to get around to doing the same  so we already know whats going on before most of the rest of the cast does  
in retrospect though  the forty minute setup is essential to enjoying the end of the film  so i have fewer complaints now then i did while i was watching the film  
im glad that the run of teenstyled horror films has passed and filmmakers are starting to make more adult fare  
films like this  the similarly themed stir of echoes  and countless others to be released later in the year should make for a pretty entertaining close to 1999

1	"the jekyll and hyde story told from his maids point of view is  in a word   dark   
you wouldnt expect something bright and cheery based on robert louis stevensons novel  but the film is surprisingly dreary and dismal  
jekyllhyde  john malkovich  is terminally depressed and desperate  
mary reilly  julia roberts  is a victim of monstrous child abuse and the antiwoman sentiment of the times  
director stephen fears version of the london slums makes us marvel that anyone survived them  
the lighting level is exceedingly low throughout the movie  it almost appears to be filmed in black and white  
the direction and cinematography are brilliant and liquid  
scenes flow into the next scene like honey oozing off a strawberry  
  except theres no red  of course   
the look is so moody and melodramatic that youll be shocked when you leave the theater  
i saw it at a matinee and took quite a while to adjust to the sunny skies afterward  
often the jekyll and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person into components of good and evil or perhaps cerebral and emotional parts  
here the doctor is intellectual and perhaps good  but certainly powerless  
his alter ego is forceful and totally without conscience  
two parts that make up a whole  
neither are capable of functioning without the other and once separated  disaster is inevitable  
the differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were accomplished by demeanor and attitude  
when we finally see the transformation  the special effects thrust the story into the realm of science fiction  not the psychological horror that the tale demands  
roberts and malkovich are skillful in their roles  
both are suitably melancholy  fitting in with the rest of the film  
the only flash of life and color comes from glenn close  and her lips  as the madam of a whorehouse where hyde lives  and surprisingly  jekyll apparently frequents  
life and color maybe  but this is not closes best role  
she seems little more than a cardboard cutout character  
a beautiful film in its own dreary way  
youll appreciate the filmmaking craft  but dont expect to leave in an upbeat mood

0	"   the following review contains spoilers   
  please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie   
 chuck dowling  the jacksonville film journal 
i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997s batman and robin  
apparently  no one heard my words  
oh  how i wish you had heard them  
oh how i wish someone had stopped him    
because hes done it again  
the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore  a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale  
in fact  it was everything that 8mm is not  
in the opening minutes of 8mm  we see private detective tom welles  nicolas cage  working on a case for a prestigious member of the u  s  government  
keep this fact in mind  cage is trusted with an important case  which he solves  
he returns home to his wife and new daughter  and even finds time to rake his yard  keep that in mind too  its important as well   
hes hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery  
after her husbands death she comes across a film in his private safe  
it appears to be snuff film  a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera  
the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film  hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film  
so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film  
the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless  
welles is actually selected for the case by the old womans lawyer  anthony heald  an actor who always plays the same type of character  that being a bad guy   
when you first see him  your first instinct is that hes behind the whole thing  
the choice of casting does the film in  
then  as welles begins his investigation  at times we will see a shadowy figure following him  
the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer  or someone sent by the lawyer  because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet  
so your first instinct has now been confirmed  
then  when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing  he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced  in one of those ridiculous  since were going to kill you anyway  why not tell you the whole thing  moments   
but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case hes told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended  
huh  
also  when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing  his main goal is to get the film back  
so why did he give it up in the first place   
the lawyer had the film the whole time  then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film   
its totally absurd    
and this is the screenwriter of seven  
late in the film theres a confrontation between all the main characters  and after a struggle one of the characters guns ends up underneath a car  
cage  who has been handcuffed to a bed  is rapidly trying to get to his gun  which is on a table  
james gandolfinis character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of  suspense   
you see  the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car hes trying to reach it from  and so instead of going around the car to the other side  where he can easily reach it  he just keeps stretching  
go around to the other side of the car   
this goes on for minutes  
then  after cage gets his gun  gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car  
boy  schumacher is really really getting on my nerves  
i think the final straw would be when cage returns home  devastated by everything that hes seen on this case  and then is no longer able to rake his lawn  
we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard  
other things that bugged me about 8mm  one would be the music  if you can call it that  
whenever the score starts up  it sounds like techno music  and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it  
awful decision there joel  
another is cages performance  
at this point hes capable of a wide range of performances  either good or bad  
for 8mm  he delivers a very wooden one  and only shines when hes interacting with joaquin phoenix  who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case   
youre capable of much better mr  cage  
now as for you mr  schumacher    
im starting to doubt if youre capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema

0	"  soldier   by director paul anderson  is a film in which any presence of originality is fleeting  
the best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russels character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision  
brutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has a lot of emotional potential power behind it  and the opening scenes tap into it a little  
then it goes nowhere with that idea  
there is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization  and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches ive ever seen  
the whole idea of the inhuman  soldiertype character gaining some degree of humanity by defending a potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done  and its been done much better  
i was able to predict the plot of the whole story  which wouldnt be so bad if other aspect of the film somewhat interesting  
between the action sequences  it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr  russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes  since his dialog is extremely limited  
his performance in that way isnt all that bad  but certainly is not enough to carry this film  
other performances in this film are really not worth much mention at all  and they generally are about as weak as their characters  
but enough of this stuff about plot and character  right  
isnt the most important part of an action film  well  the action  
even in this aspect the film is a disappointment  
in mortal kombat  1995   director paul anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography of action in a film can override problems with plot and produce something entertaining  
however  he fails to repeat that in this film  
the combat scenes  particularly the big one at the end  is incredibly unimaginatve  
fighting and combat scenes are supposed to bring about thrills in this type of movie  a point which even an otherwise unimpressive film like starship troopers seemed to realize  
but instead of reaching for something truly interesting to end the film with  it goes for the old  shootem up  one guy vs  an army type of cinema that i thought died with the military action films of the 80s  
if the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with the introduction more seriously  it could have been a rather engaging science fiction film  
however  it utterly failed to go in any new directions after that  making the film a big disappointment

0	"heres a concept  jeanclaude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie  
now if that isnt enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie  i dont know what is  
all sarcasm aside  it is certainly a different way to start a movie  of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother  so lucky us  we get to see more of jeanclaude  
van damme 1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives  
van damme 2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after 1 gets killed in france  
the remaining twin  the french cop  goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death  
once there  he hooks up with his deceased brothers girlfriend  played by natasha henstridge  and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are  
jeanclaudes acting abilities dont seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie  
in other words  just in case you missed the sarcasm  his acting is worse than normal  
on the upside  natasha henstridge is in this film  and she does what she did best in species  she gets naked  
sadly  this is probably the high point in the movie  
she is actually a decent actress  but didnt improve as much as i thought she would after species  
this is the typical van damme movie  with jeanclaude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents  
nothing new here  and certainly nothing we havent seen in every other van damme movie  
simply put  there is absolutely nothing new about this movie  
it has a retread plot  this isnt the first time jeanclaude has played twins  
he still cant act  
we all saw natashas breasts in species  although this is one repeat performance im not complaining about   
this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in  sub par

1	"  the tailor of panama  is a different kind of spy movie  
despite the presence of pierce brosnan  there is nary a hint of james bond flash here  
instead of big action scenes  leering super villains and emptyheaded femme fatales  we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation  
based on the novel by john le carr   who also cowrote the screenplay  the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year  a solid  welltold story  
brosnan plays andy osnard  a british operative walking on thin ice  
his british superiors ship him off to panama  making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement  
osnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new coworkers and his new home base  
when shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that  since the creation of the panama canal  the structure is the sole connection between north and south america  he barely keeps from yawning  
brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007  investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end  
searching for a way to get information on the government  osnard sets his sights on harry pendel  geoffrey rush   an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite  
harry claims to be a transplant from britains renowned saville row  but osnard knows his secret  the tailor is an excon who served five years in prison after torching his uncles shop in an insurance scam  
he also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt  having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm  
osnard offers harry a way out  
he will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele  
eager to comply  harry offers what he knows  then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing  
before long  he is forced to spy on his loving wife  louisa  jamie lee curtis   an aide to the canal director  
harrys little lies build  eventually taking on a life of their own  
osnard turns in reports about the  silent opposition   a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal  
the bogus revelation proves explosive  leading to meetings in washington d  c  over how to best protect the vital waterway  
meanwhile  osnard wallows in his newfound status  enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive coworker  
and harry grows ever more fretful  fearing the consequences if his clients  not to mention his wife  learn about his lies  
geoffrey rush is wonderful as harry  fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings  all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor  
rush makes harry a credible figure  presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity  
after gaining fame playing larger than life characters  rush flips everything around for this role  using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems  
although she gets far too little screen time  jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her  
of the central characters  she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine selfconfidence  
curtis is one of my favorite female actors  whiplash smart  sultry and charismatic  she deserves more than supporting roles  
speaking of supporting characters  there are some great ones here  
harold pinter is amusing as harrys uncle benny  who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways  
also shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker  who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr  strangelove school of armed patriotism  
but the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson  both outstanding as two wounded activists  
their presence adds weight to the story  reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men  there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal  
director john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location  
instead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop  he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there  
the metropolis  described by one character as  casablanca without heroes  pulsates with life  underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people  
  the tailor of panama  succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment

1	"  footloose  has only one goal in mind  to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feelgood antics  
and i hate to admit it  i fell for it  
the movie is about a teenager  bacon  who moves to a small town from the big city  and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend  lithgow   
he ends up falling for the preachers daughter  singer  and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do  
as mentioned at the beginning of this review   footloose  is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama  
there are virtually no surprises  and the writing is secondrate  
so why did i enjoy it so much  
for one thing  the cast is great  
kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role  
were rooting for him right from the start  and  unlike most films of this genre  bacon doesnt play him as the  rebel without a clue  sort  
yes  he does rebel  but hes also polite when he needs to be  
and he never broods  
the rest of the cast is equally impressive  
john lithgow  seen here playing a normal guy for a change  is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian  
but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter  
by the end of the film  we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character  
another nice touch is the music  
we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with  sexual innuendos   but thats not true at all  
the title track  performed by kenny loggins  is upbeat and fun  
during the final sequence  i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing  
of course  i soon realized that would be a little pathetic  
anyway   footloose  is a charming little surprise  
dont let the premise prevent you from watching it  
it sucked me in  and itll do the same to you

1	"usually a movie is about something more than a soiled rug  but not the big lebowski  
the new offering from the creators of 1996s critical hit fargo  is to say the least  wildly entertaining  
originality has always been a strong trait in the coen brothers movies  and the big lebowski is insanely original  
it begins oddly enough when jeff  the dude  lebowski  jeff bridges  is mistaken for a millionaire  jeff  the big  lebowski  david huddleston   whos wife  bunny  tara reid  owes money all over town  
two goons  out to collect on bunnys debt break into dudes house  
they attempt to collect the money that bunny owes them and one of them urinates on his rug  
the next day dude explains his situation to his bowling team  steve buscemi  john goodman  respectively   
he is advised to go to the big lebowski and get him to pay for the defiled rug  
he does this  and shortly after gets tied up in a kidnapping caper  
this is a extremely funny movie with lots of belly laugh moments  
the coen brothers have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly  
also several great supporting roles  john turturro as a child molesting bowler named jesus  
the coens script plays off perfectly and it all goes together to make it extremely entertaining  
i doubt this movie will be nearly as popular as fargo  but its off the wall moments make it so far the best of 1998  
if you like anything else the coen brothers have done you will love this one  if not they give this one a try its a little different

1	"titanic is  without a doubt  the best movie ive seen all year  
and believe me  im not an easy critic to impress  the english patient was too long  men in black was overhyped  and several of the  big summer releases  were dead in the water  
thank god this film got delayed until december  
its my christmas present  
titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of yearsgoneby  and it is truly a stunning film  
while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized  never taking your eyes off the screen  nor checking your watch to see how much longer its gonna last  despite its 3 hour plus running time  
as a friend of mine  whos a true titanicbuff  said  if someone doesnt like this film  its because they didnt want to   
truer words are hard to come by  
of course  it doesnt hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors  james cameron  who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time  
if you wish to argue that point with me  look at his list of credits  the terminator  aliens  the abyss  terminator 2  true lies  etc  still care to disagree  
not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film  he also wrote  produced  and edited it  
and to show his true faith for the project  he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs  
its obvious he truly loves titanic  
the film opens with footage  both real and fake  of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic  where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the  heart of the ocean   which  according to bill paxtons character  would be worth more than the hope diamond today  
their search turns up  dissapointly  no diamond  but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond  
this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose  who claims to be the girl in the picture  
she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond  
almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past  
roses narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl  engaged to a rich man named cal hockley  billy zane  that she didnt want to marry  
her mother is pushy and obnoxious  and cal hockley is arrogant  
they are boarding the titanic  which is sailing to america  and this is where she is to marry cal  
meanwhile  a young man named jack dawson  leonardo dicaprio  and his italian friend  danny nucci  win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game  
they are overjoyed  and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving  
for them  this is their ticket to america  to a better life  
for rose  she is sailing to her doom  
the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt  kate winslet  and jack dawson fall in love  
its the classic wrongsideofthetracks story  and does sometimes resort to a few cliches  
but as i said above  the love portion isnt sappy and doesnt  weigh the film down   as some critics have said  
its sweet  and it didnt make me restless at all  despite the fact that i usually hate love stories  
of course  it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen  
most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912  including the enigmatic molly brown  played by the talented kathy bates   the captain of titanic  bernard hill   and so on  
all of these characters add an extra depth to the film  and make it that easier to watch  
of course  things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark  where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom  
the sinking is depicted realisticly  and the effects are truly amazing  
it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either  as people are portrayed as panicking  pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats  and drowning and dying horrible deaths  
the best part of the movie  in my opinion  comes at the very end  when we flash back to the future  
the crew  who at first had been skeptical of roses story  now are totally aborbed by her  
rose goes out onto the ships ledge  and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard  
we then see a dream of roses  in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson  
most people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream  
however  i think it symbolized more  i think it meant that rose had died  and is going to a sort of heaven  which would be the happiest part of her life  her and her one true love  jack  
if anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this  email me at venom8hotmail  com

1	"  rebel without a cause  is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to  
everyone feels that they are different in some way  that they dont belong in some places and  rebel without a cause  successfully shows on screen these universal emotions  
no matter what generation you belong to  these feelings are present  
this is why james dean is admired by america  because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute  
in our minds  we just try to do the right thing just like deans jim stark does  
not only does  rebel without a cause  display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure  
each generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection  
this is because times change and in response people change  
no matter how popular you were once  as your generation grows older  newer breeds look at you in a different light  
this is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents  
even if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past  the teens could not believe this  
in one humorous scene  stark  his girlfriend judy  natalie wood   and his pal plato  sal mineo  pretend they are adults  
they use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored  
this scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another  
speaking on behalf of my generation  i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by  
the only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation  same 
goes for brando  redford  even deniro  
i can only imagine how vaguely matt damon  ben affleck  and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century  
will dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten  
any film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in american film  
even if  rebel without a cause  has some ridiculous scenes  the game of chicken  did people really act this way    an unbelievable conclusion  how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end    and a silly romance  wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours  it still is a fabulous film  
the acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool  
now  however  the coolness is fading

0	"here i sit at my computer about to write my review of the recent action comedy  bait  starring jamie foxx and david morse  
this is a review i dont even want to write because id just be laying the same criticisms on it that i would with any other sogenericandpredictableitsbeyondridiculous piece of hollywood fluff  
if theyre not going to give us  the audience  just a little credit and put something together with half a brain  why should i waste my time and mental energy criticising it  
last summer i took this same approach with my review of  the mummy   in that review i just quoted phrases my reviews of other subpar movies  
i think i shall do the same thing here but with a few less quotes  not all are applicable   
i hope this goes to show you what i think of  bait  and why you can find out all you need to know about it without having to take a wild guess  
its genuinely unfunny  i  and the other audience members only laughed once during the entire two hours   unoriginal and unthrilling  
its not so bad to the point where its fun to watch because of its badness and its no so bad you absolute loathe it and are pained by watching it  its just such a cliche in and of itself  that  uhh    
lost my train of thought  
anyways  heres those quotes  enjoy  
  getting an audiences attention right from the beginning plays a major role in how todays films work  
we want to have something exciting to watch  not a slow buildup of a story  god forbid    and this film plays right into the mainstreams hands     
 review of  armageddon   
  its clear the film doesnt want to waste time on reality and thus the attempt to establish plausability  the most minimal amount necessary  comes across as a halfassed effort  
supporting characters and shady supplots are introduced  but as is the case with films made up of a large cast of characters  only a handful have any real significance    
theres a fine line separating homage from plagiarism       review of  godzilla   1998  
  unfortunately  as is the case with most modern thrillers  once the film showed potential for authenticity and intelligence  the cliches and action sequences take over    review of  the jackal

1	"ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon  the book of the dead  
bruce campbell stars as ash  who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods  and his friends who have become demons  including his own girlfriend   
the results shown on screen are amazing considering the films tiny budget  constant location changes  and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years  
followed by two sequels  evil dead ii  1987  and army of darkness  1993   
the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in its original aspect ratio of 1  33  1  
the disc contains two versions of the films audio  a stereo 2  0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5  1  
included are two separate running commentary tracks  the first features writerdirector sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the films star  bruce campbell  
campbells commentary is informative and extremely witty  as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film  
such informative tidbits include  the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead  and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was its title  and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead  everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard  
also  theres a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which theyve found thats explaining about the demonic forces in the woods  
for that scene  it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana  so being the wacky kids that they were at the time  they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene  
almost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actors had never smoked before  and as a result they became  confused  and were unable to perform the scene  
i wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimirob tapert audio track  
the two people youd think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all  
dont get me wrong here  when they do speak its entertaining to hear  but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time  
sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask  have anything to say sam   
to me  thats not a good sign  
also  it seems like sam raimi doesnt remember much about the film and its production    
well  compared to rob and bruce anyway  
also included on the disc is a photo gallery  which includes pictures from the films  gala  premiere  and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film  
this raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques  
overall  the evil dead is a good low budget horror film  superior to many films in its genre  
and the collectors edition dvd release is well worth your time if youre either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process  
all special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining

1	"seen august 8  1998 at 6 p  m  at rotterdam square cinemas  rotterdam  ny   theater 6  by myself for free using my sonyloews critics pass  
theater rating      good seats  sound  and picture 
war is a topic that cant help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media  
movies  documentaries  and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on  such as strategy  politics  and victory  
its easy to forget war  in its most basic form  is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other  
forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier  no matter what his rank or importance  is a real fleshandblood person and not just a number  
  saving private ryan  is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect  especially in its unapologetic  realistic delivery  
it proves theres a huge difference between battling and killing  
the film opens with one of the most graphic  disturbing scenes in recent memory  
its world war ii  dday to be exact  and the u  s  military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them  
spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality  
instead of positioned cameras  the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared  
there is no sense of stability  but of constant  anxious  and confusing motion  giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle  and just a vulnerable as the poor troops  
  poor  is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are  
there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters  
we dont get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles  but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding  
the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated  but as people that must be destroyed because theyre there  
in the movies  the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch  but in reality that wouldnt happen  
the men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies  
they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the wellsecured germans who can actually see who  what  and where theyre shooting  unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off  
perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are  but that seems to be part of the theme  
the film seems to rely on the audiences sense of patriotism  that the american military is  right  and good and that the nazis are  inherently evil   
the battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold  a whole 50foot progression   and begin to inflict some damage  
i have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up  i couldnt help but feel some sense of joy and relief  
to triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure  but theres nothing cliche about the graphic  detailed  atmosphere here because it really happened  
one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is  and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting  
the plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet  
tom hanks stars as captain miller  a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon  
hes never obsessive or any such generic  cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this  
he doesnt want to be there any more than his men  but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out  
the mission the film is concerned with is  as the title states  saving private ryan  
through a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker  it is brought to a generals attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of eachs death simultaneously  
when they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe  they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother  
its easy to sympathize with this situation  after all  no one should have to lose all their children at once  
but finding one man in this war is  as miller puts it   like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles   
the saving of private ryan isnt just a dramatic device  but a thematic one  
his salvation represents the sense of innocence the country  the world even  was trying to convince itself it still had  
when millers company hears of the mission  they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead  but miller isnt so quick to shrug it off  
he knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope  and now he has the opportunity to make someones sense of hope a reality  
the mission to find ryan gives millers group a destination  but not direction  
along the way many things happen to them  both good and bad  
a few battles are fought  not to be major accomplishments for the war  but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice  
the act of killing itself becomes one of the films major philosophical metaphors  
the soldiers dont mind killing other soldiers in blind battle  but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go  they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses  
unfortunately  death is a fact of war  and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters  but here spielberg doesnt want us to think these men are invincible  
in fact  only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man  and the performances are good enough to make this method work  
although the characters are somewhat typical  the actors maintain control over the material at all time  
whether theyre arguing with each other  telling stories of back home  or fighting the germans  they never go overboard and always seem believable  
sure  theres a zinger here and there  but war doesnt change the fact boys will be boys  
if and when one dies we too can feel the loss  even though we hardly knew them  
the final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous  violent battle sequence  
private ryan has been found  but facing four to one odds  can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive  
thats not a premise for thrills  its symbolic of everything the film has worked for  
it would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending  it ends the way it must end  
i remember reading a  calvin  hobbes  comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like   dad  how do armies of men killing each other solve problems   
  saving private ryan  is the adult version of that question

0	"one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek  the star of the wbs runaway hit dawsons creek  
following in the foot steps of mtvs two other live action films  joes apartment  1996  and dead man on campus  1998   varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace  
set in west cannan  texas  the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john  mox  moxon  van der beek   
we know hes smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook  
coach bud kilmer  jon voight  has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him  
the star quarterback  lance harbor  paul walker   is a handsome  blonde  hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader  darcy  ali larter   
also on the team are an enormous guy  ron lester  with some health problems and the token africanamerican team member  eliel swinton  whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin  
when lance is seriously injured  mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it  undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies  
his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend  jules  amy smart   is threatened and theres a big game at the end  
guess who wins  
nothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love  
theres a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow  
van der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes  
also  the role isnt very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character  
hes still a pseudointellectual  whiny  nice guy  except here he also happens to be a jock  
voight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out  
the other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers dont fare much better  
on the positive side  walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville  1998   
scott  son of james  caan has some lively moments as tweeder  the teams wild man  
larter  as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas  gets to show off the films most interesting costumes  including a very eyeopening  whipped cream bikini   
its interesting to note that the film definitely earns its rrating with a lot of harsh language  alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity  including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise   
all this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawsons creek  presumably the target audience for the picture  
director brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger  from nickelodeon films  a sister company of mtv  and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression  
the look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it  
the football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out  
theres an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul  foo fighters  green day and aaliyah but its not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film

1	"its not often that i laugh so hard at a movie that my head hurts  
but thats just what happened to me at uhf  weird al yankovics big screen debut  
uhf is a television parody a la airplane  and like airplane  the movie is extraordinarily stupid  
but its dumb in the best way a movie can be dumb  its so silly and outrageous its hilarious  
the movie stars weird al as george newman  a world class nerd with a hyperactive imagination  the type who fantasizes hes indiana jones and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns  
george is basically a loser  his daydreams and smartalec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for more than two weeks  
but george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel 62 in a poker game and makes him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station  
george revives channel 62 with innovative programming  shows like  wheel of fish  and movies like  conan  the librarian   
as the stations ratings rise  it comes into competition with channel 8  the leading vhf networkaffiliate  
as r  j  
fletcherchannel 8s illnatured  hardnosed ownerveteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy  he really hams it up with his snorts  grimaces  and scowls  
uhf satirizes anything and everything to do with television  including game shows  tabloid talk shows  childrens shows  dizzy news women  and movieseverything from rambo to close encounters  
the funniest scene  the one that made my head spin  is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed  
like most movies in its genre  uhf is hit or miss  
for every gag that works  at least one fizzles  
for instance  weird als mock video of  money for nothing  by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to a grinding halt  although it does have some nifty computer animation   
but the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail  we know another gut wrencher is on the way  
in fact  uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplanetype movie since    
well  since airplane  
much of the credit goes to weird als exceptionally inventive script and to the movies winsome cast  
weird al seems a little stiff at the beginning  but because hes not afraid to look silly  he ultimately has a lot of fun with his character  
the real standout is michael richards as stanley  the dimwitted janitor who becomes the host of his own childrens show   stanley spadowskis playhouse   
stanleys offbeat  mixedup personality is a big hit with the audience and makes him an overnight star  
he is an endearing mixture of goodnatured innocence  highenergy enthusiasm  and puppydog cuteness  
and above all  hes a good janitor who adores his work  
another highlight is a vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips  
the cast also features gedde watanabe  the chinese foreignexchange student in sixteen candles  as the karate master who hosts the hit series   wheel of fish   
also aboard for the ride is fran drescher  who plays pamela finklestein  channel 62s roving reporter  
unfortunately  as weird als girlfriend  victoria jackson is wasted in a role that calls for nothing but whimpering  whining  and sulking  
her character is extraneous and should have been either further integrated into the story or cut from the script altogether  
while uhf is not an absolute mustsee  its definitely the ticket if youre looking for a wild and zany  whackedout comedy  
the movie is good enough to see in the theaters  but it may work even better on television  the very medium at which it pokes fun

0	"the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffanys in which the audience is rooting for some sweet  vulnerable  irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness  
the problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo  played by sookyin lee  as neither sweet nor vulnerable and she is quite resistible  
alessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene  
this is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland  
one of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa  
she also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window  
next door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild  adam beach   
he sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating  
ben gets emotionally involved with alessa  
  as alessa so delicately puts it   we were bosom buddies  now were fuck buddies    
but alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor  
the real problem with the film seems to be helen lees inability to decide what she wants to be saying  
she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa  
alessa is looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients  
this appears to be a high profile and wellpaid job  
we are supposed to care about alessas feelings  but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father  
alessa cannot be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint  
this is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up doublezero  
i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale

will everyone in the town turn against the coach  
will the team win the climactic game  
do cats bathe themselves regularly  
the socalled  hero  in question is john moxin  james van der beek   a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team  but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the deadend town  
at least hes got the right idea  since west canaan  texas is portrayed in the film as  frankly  pathetic  with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming  
heck  in one scene  the front page of the towns newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers big win the night before  
when the teams star quarterback is severely injured  tearing the ligaments in his leg  john finds himself taking over as the teams leader  but his few minutes of glory do not last long  as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend  amy smart  when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl  ali larter   
and after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint  all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics   the team loses their secondtolast game  putting john at feuds with the coach  jon voight who  like gary oldman  is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the  bad guy    
worse yet  the coach is threatening to ruin johns scholarship chances if the badgers dont win their final game  
the plotting of  varsity blues  is as old as the hills  and contains every cliche in the book  
admittedly  i was never exactly bored while i was watching it  but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained  
throughout  all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983s  all the right moves   
one of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were  least of all certainly not john  who  played by van der beek  of tvs  dawsons creek    is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities  
while i probably shouldnt blame this on van der beek  since the inauspicious and  bythenumbers  screenplay by w  peter iliff isnt of any help  he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in  all the right moves   
the story revolving around john  meanwhile  is extemely thin throughout  particularly for its 104minute running time  and it alternates between uninspired comic relief  as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club  and heavyhanded melodrama  
the romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot  but we also learned very little about her  which is unfortunate since amy smart  whom i dont think ive seen before in past films  is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence  
smart does not allow her character to become the  passive girlfriend   instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions  
its too bad the camera didnt linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts  
the adult characters probably fare the worse of any  since they all must play residents of a dimwitted town that cares about nothing but football  
johns relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance  
his father is set on him becoming a football player at a university  but john doesnt want any part of that  
his mother stands beside her  big  strong husband  and is a passive female  
finally  jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than onedimensional  
saving  varsity blues  from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences  including one set in the sex education class  which did get a laugh out of me  
the scenes of playing football were wellshot and thankfully didnt overstay their welcome  as many sports films fall victim to  
but leaving the theater  the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made  
i seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately  since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood  
do we really need another highschool sports film  
no  we dont  and certainly not one of this lowcaliber  which felt like a cutandpaste job of spare parts from much better  but similar  films  
  varsity blues   no doubt is the first one  however  to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts

1	"note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
among my fanatical ticker tapeworshipping friends  theres one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofskys darkly original pi  the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which  through analysis  will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour  
  an example of the mentality involved  if the stock price goes up like this  and then down like that  and then sharply up this way  it then will go  this  way   
while i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market  knowledge check  prices up  good  prices down  bad  most of the time  at least  and hence really couldnt comment with any authority  its always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system  and besides  if it were that simple  no doubt somebody wouldve already figured it all out   
the difference in this case is that while my colleague  an otherwise assuredly realistic individual  truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster  pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its characters psychosis  
its also vastly more convincing with its argument  
  mathematics is the language of the universe   insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen  sean gullette  in a cool  mantralike voiceover which repeats throughout the picture  
since nature can be expressed in numbers  and there are patterns everywhere in nature  he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything  the ups and downs of the stock market  how many games the yankees will win this year  the flavour of jam im going to put on my toast tomorrow morning  
obsessed with finding the proverbial key to the universe  max lives in paranoid  selfimposed solitude in a seedy nyc chinatown apartment  singlemindedly toiling away with his monstrous homemade computer system  
sullenly withdrawn and plauged by debilitating migraines  the elusive pursuit of a mysterious 216digit number his machine spits out one day is driving him into madness  
the story  then  is basically an eccentricity  but its a clever  astute eccentricity  perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism  in an age where a dominant societal phobia is ones individualism being replaced by a series of numeric identifiers  maxs allconsuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering  unsettling mood  
it helps matters that hes not a particularly likable protagonist  
all attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max  a spindly  neuroticlooking individual who hasnt the time to indulge in pleasantries  
for a film which puts its lead character front and center  mr  gullette appears in virtually every scene   pi takes a refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics  because of our ambivalence with max  were not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as were following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination  its more disturbing journey than quest  
still  we do care about maxs fate  
teetering on the edge of dementia  he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain  both fronted by deliciously perky  resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions  
as we know  in films where paranoia is a dominant element  see the truman shows laura linney character   or for that matter  in real life  its always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary  
pi  a film that addresses patterns  itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle  headache scene  important revelation or bit of plot development  pillpopping montage  hallucinatory nightmare  with decidedly cronenbergesque undertones  few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and bodythemed horror   nosebleeding reality  
the repetitiveness  far from being tedious  is effectively maddening  more than anything  the picture aims to get under our skins and take in events from maxs claustrophobic perspective  
in this regard  it wildly succeeds due to mr  aronofskys striking direction  
its a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself into a protagonists warped perspective of his surrounding  and high contrast blackandwhite cinematography combined with constant usage of extreme closeups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings  
  in some scenes  the stark composition in conjunction with the lumbering approach by mr  gullette make his character curiously resemble a latterday max schreck  from nosferatu   
using savage  jittery lensing and rapid cuts to create a sense of disorientation  the picture is often dizzying to behold  and maxs effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the socalled snorri cam  which keep him in plain focus while the environment races by in blurred bursts  
pis raw  aggressive visuals are reminiscent of david lynchs early work  in particular  eraserhead   
the films sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately with a dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by a sly electronic score by clint mansell  and gradually increases in intensity  
still  amidst all its kafkaesque qualities and overall dispassionate mood  pi does occasionally display a sense of humour  
at one point  marcy dawson  pamela hart  great fun  entices max with the offer of an invaluable treasure  a oneofakind    
computer chip  
  isnt it beautiful   she coos  
a showcase for mr  aronofskys technical virtuosity  made for 60 000  its since gone on to capture acclaim at the 1998 sundance film festival   pi is an intriguingly cerebral story which  ironically  is perhaps the most purely visceral film of the year

1	"jay and silent bob strike back  kevin smiths swan song to his two most famous characters  is the best received comedy that ive seen since theres something about mary  which is a tea party in comparison to the foulmouthed humor in jay and silent bob strike back  
the audience didnt just laugh  they went wild with boisterous laughter and heavy applause throughout  
in short  if you like really raunchy humor  you may find it  as i did  to be the funniest movie of the year  
  on the other hand  if you are one of those who walked out in disgust with smiths dogma  then jay and silent bob strike back is not the movie for you   
in one of the fastest paced movies of the year  the story has jay and silent bob  jason mewes and kevin smith   a pair of card carrying drug dealers  traveling from their new jersey convenience store home to hollywood so that they can stop a movie  
it seems their comic book alter egos  bluntman and chronic  are being used in a movie without jay and silent bobs consent  
jason biggs and james van der beek are slated to star in it  
jay and silent bob strike back has more and better used cameos than just about any movie that ive ever seen  
among others  they include carrie fisher as a bibletoting nun  mark hamill as a comic book version of his famous alter ego and gus van sant as a director too busy counting his money to yell   action   
best of all are ben affleck and matt damon who mock themselves and their movies  
the film stops several times to make fun of itself and of the audience who was  stupid  enough to buy tickets to this movie  
  actually  purchasing tickets to this film is extremely smart given that it delivers more laughter per dollar than anything in recent memory   
the film even skewers people who write about movies on the internet  
guilty  
although its filled with inside jokes  youll still be laughing even if you only get some of them  
its easy to understand enough so that they are still funny  
jay is a motor mouth who hasnt met a subject that he couldnt vulgarize  
his favorite topic is oral sex  but  being an equal opportunity profaner  hes willing to make crude jokes about absolutely anything  
but it is his buddy  the aptly named silent bob  who is responsible for most of the movies success  
his reaction shots  with his wildly exaggerated eye movements  are comedic gems  
the storys main subplot concerns four animal rights activists  justice  shannon elizabeth  and her three sexy buddies  sissy  eliza dushku   missy  jennifer schwalbach smith  and chrissy  ali larter   
these charlies angels types give a ride to our heroes on their trek to lalaland to stop the picture  
jay tries to put the moves on justice  but he doesnt stay in command of the situation for long  
one of the funnier sight gags has the women using a pink  clamshaped  birth control case that contains high tech gadgetry  
granted  its not the movie for everyone  but  if you like kevin smiths brand of humor  youll find that this is his best  
and  as i said earlier  its the funniest movie of the year thus far  
no  wait  
forget  thus far   
its bound to be the funniest movie of the year  
in a time when almost every movie feels obligated to come in at pg13 so that they can rake in the maximum cash  its great to see a filmmaker with the guts to target only a mature audience  
jay and silent bob strike back runs a lightening fast 1  35  
it is rated r and contains pervasive crude humor and language and sexual situations  
it would be acceptable for high school seniors and older  
the film opens nationwide in the united states on wednesday  august 22  2001  
in the silicon valley  it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters

1	"hedwig  john cameron mitchell  was born a boy named hansel in east berlin  
as a teen seeking his  other half   he reluctantly agrees to a sex change operation in order to marry american g  i  
luther  maurice dean wint   
the operation  performed by a hack surgeon  is botched  and the  angry inch  is all thats left  
now a  she   hedwig comes to america  is abandoned by luther  forms a rock band and falls for her 17year old loverprot  g   tommy  only to be rejected by him later  too  
she and her band  the angry inch  shadows the nowfamous tommy gnosis across the us  for revenge    but hedwig is really in search of her lost other half in  hedwig and the angry inch   
first time helmer john cameron mitchell  along with composerlyricist stephen trask  created and starred in their acclaimed offbroadway production that has become the movie  
and quite a movie it is in its eclectic variety of songs  outrageous costumes  sets and makeup and  especially  a riveting performance by mitchell as the title character  
mitchell and trask have reinvented the movie musical and couple it with the underlying story of just whom hedwig is and what she is looking for  
i am  by far  not a big fan of musicals  
sure  there are exceptions  like bob fosses  all that jazz  and  cabaret   but  for the most part  they are just not my cup of tea  
  hedwig and the angry inch  is an exception  though  with its combination of humor  wit and a collection of tunes that covers musical styles ranging from  the rocky horror picture show  and meatloaf to david bowie to the sex pistols  
the original songs  by stephen trask  also appearing as one of the members of the band the angry inch   are full of energy and variety and  even though its not my kind of music  i found every one entertaining and fun  
the audience i saw  hedwig  with thought so  too  
the main attraction to this onemanwoman show is the presence of its star  
john cameron mitchell gives a solid  sometimes fun  sometimes angry performance as a person searching for selfenlightenment and love  
as a young boy growing up in east berlin  hansel is abused by his g  i  
father and raised by his german mother in a tiny flat so small that  mother would make me play in the oven  where he listened to pop music on armed forces radio  
later  as a young man  he meets luther  another g  i  
and is swept off of his feet  
the ensuing angry inch incident comes soon after  
flash forward to a trailer park in junction city  kansas  and luther is leaving hedwig for another boy  
frustrated and broke  she takes on babysitting and the odd  job  to make ends meet  
she also forms a band with four korean housewives and the musical talent of hedwig is born  
she meets  falls for and loses young tommy  who steals her songs and goes off to become a rock sensation  
jealous and angry  hedwig and her new band begins a campaign to shadow tommys tours and  with the help of her manager  phyllis stein  andrea martin   is trying get a law suit going against the star for stealing her songs  
hedwig and the angry inch get gigs  not coincidentally  at a chain of seafood restaurants that just happen to be next to the forums where tommy gnosis is playing  
things finally come to a head  so to speak  in new york city  
the popularity of the offbroadway musical and its offshoots have garnered a readymade audience base for  hedwig   
the wit  humor  music and search for identity has great appeal to young adults  but the charismatic presence of mitchell makes this a cut above what it could have been  
it is this onemanwoman show that casts its spotlight on its  internationally ignored  rock star and mitchell is outstanding in the role  
there isnt a lot going on with other characters  though there are amusing little sidebars  like hedwigs backup singerlover  yitzak  miriam shor   deciding to break away from the band to join a polynesian road show of  rent  as a puerto rican drag queen  
the low budget that the moviemakers have for the production belies the quality of the film  
attention to details  hedwigs costumes and outrageous  cabaret  like makeup  the seedy trailer park setting  and  the kitschy seafood restaurants  are loads of fun to watch and lend the appropriate air to the proceeds  all on what has to be a beer budget  
  hedwig and the angry inch  may not be for everybody  but the energy of the effort  the songs  the imaginative sets and costumes and a fast steady pace make it a pleasure to watch  
if youre a fan of contemporary  edgy music  it is an even bigger draw  
i give it a b

1	"i can hear the question already  
what on earth do these two movies have in common  
to most people  not a lot  except that both are by renowned directors  
as i saw them  however  both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers  
but oh  how differently the packages affect their films  
while  everyones  production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special  jane campions imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones script is  
i left  everyone says i love you  not remembering a lot about who loved whom  but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face  
i left  the portrait of a lady  not remembering a lot about who loved whom  and i could have cared less  
  everyone  features nothing allen hasnt done before storywise  
woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman  roberts   and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrongagain  
similar situations happen to his family and friends  
some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his  early  funny  films  
the scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of  take the money and run   his directorial debut  
however  nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this oneofakind display of sheer good spirits  
in fact  in this movie  the feeling itself is whats most important  
yes  the movie would have been betteramong his very best  i thinkif it had a meatier story  
but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling  
and what better way to express feeling than through music  
love is often best expressed in a song  and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart  
some are a tad too goofy  such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor  but i admired allen for even putting them in there  
it also helps that as usual  allen has a topflight cast working with him  
their singing voices range from quite good  goldie hawn  to not quite good  allen  to literally unlistenable  barrymore  whose real voice was dubbed by a professional   
but while their vocal abilities differ  all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen  and making it rub off on the audience  
granted  some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies  but for those attuned to it  this film should work wonders  
jane campion  too  has a topflight cast working for her in  portrait of a lady   too  but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted  virtually lifeless mess  albeit a visually interesting one  
campion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eyefilling images that linger in the mind  
unfortunately  what didnt linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting  
i remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman  but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people  
even worse  i dont find myself feeling bad that ive forgotten  
the problem  i think  lies not with the cast  which seemed to be trying very hard for the material  
it was the script that couldnt convince me to care about anyone  
the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion  but i found no reason to connect with any of them  
i understood that the story was about cold  emotionally vacant characters  but for me to care about them  i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives  
jones script never simply gave me that opportunity  
in the end  it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes  
unfortunately  as she kept painting these dazzling pictures  they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film  
in the end  the movies one strength ended up hurting it  
so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots  and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them  
why  
with both films  my head cared about neither story  but only  everyone says i love you  was able to make my heart sing

0	"if you dont think kevin kline in drag is funny  wait  til you see will smith in dragits even less funny  
by the time jim west  smith  disguised himself as a belly dancer to bail his captured comrade  artemus gordon  kline   from the clutches of evil dr  loveless  branagh   i was unequivocally bored by wild wild west  the new summer blockbuster from men in black director barry sonnenfeld  
is the old west really a breeding ground for high comedy  anyway  
  if your answer is no  then you recall rustlers rhapsody or back to the future part iii  if your answer is yes  youre thinking of blazing saddles  but that movie was a parody of the western genre  not a nineteenth century romp   
1869  jim west is a quickdraw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon  under orders from president grant  kline again  whose impression  for all we know  is deadon   to apprehend legless loveless  the mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the united states and sell it back to britain and spain  
how will loveless accomplish this  
well  by hulking around the desert in an enormous  mechanical tarantula  of course  
bosomy dance hall girl rita escobar  hayek   whose scientist father was kidnapped by loveless  joins west and gordon on their gadgetfilled train  
  gordon first discovers rita in a cage  waiting to be rescued   
racial politics obviously prevented the filmmakers from pairing dull rita romantically with west  despite the movies  hip  attitude toward the black thing  
  west automatically shoots anyone who calls him a  nigger  before that person can finish speaking the word  
super   
at any rate  i kept waiting for rita to say something humourous  but shes a walking dressup toy  
  her single comic moment is also the best shot of the film  she bashfully reveals bare bumcheeks through the peekaboo flap of her pyjamas   
jim west is the role that finally stymied will smith  whose comic timing has always been hit or miss  as episodes of  the fresh prince of belair  demonstrate  
smiths a better reactor than actor  which is why he was so thoroughly engaging in men in blackhe didnt start out a hero  
in wild wild west hes required to exude eastwood cool and amuse at the same time  and from frame one   a difficult feat im not sure any living performer could pull off  
smith is ill equipped  for example  to handle the moment in which jim west performs standup for some rednecks at his own hanging  
what attracted sonnenfeld to this material  
this isnt the first time he has adapted a tv show for the big screen  the addams family  anyone    but its the first big stinker of his career as a director  
wild wild west is poorlypaced bombast  full of doa gags  ted levine shows up as a general who uses a gramophone horn for a hearing aid  levine played buffalo bill in the silence of the lambshes too intense to get an intentional laugh   lousy special effects  the bluescreening is amateurishforegrounds are never proportionate to the backgrounds   and frequent illogic  
  to wit  its ridiculous villain so badly wants jim west out of the way that he    drops 
him onto a steel platform to do battle with some generic  ugly henchmen  instead of shooting him at point blank rage with one of the many guns on board the tarantula   
wild wild wests bright spots  such as the cool opening credits sequence  bai lings alltoobrief appearance as a femme fatale  or the brilliant  his masters voice  joke  are all part of the films first half  which is more clever and enjoyable  at least  than its second  
when  towards what seemed like the end of wild wild west  gordon proposes the idea of building an airplane and west rejects it  there was a collective groan among audience members  it meant we were going to have to sit through another loud action sequence before gordon builds the glider  the invention of which would inevitably lead to the proverbial whizbang finale

0	"here is a movie that sadly follows the hong kongrecipe of moviemaking and storytelling to the letter  
these kinds of movies are marked by an eyeopening sequence that introduces us to the main characters  a lifeanddeath plot in which these characters become involved  the inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters  ridiculous subplots  and sunglasswearing henchmen  
that is not to say that i dont like hong kong influenced movies  however  it is quite obvious that these moviemakers havent a clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hiphoptalking thugs and stupid sight gags  
observe the opening sequence  
a band of hitmen are about to storm an apartment  led by melvin  mark wahlberg  and cisco  lou diamond phillips   
they are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles  
however  their partner is unsure of which cable to cut  
he is undecided  
this happens for about 10 seconds  
the audience finds some humor in his foolishness  
the lights suddenly go out  
cisco is surprised and says   whoa    lets 
go   
and they storm the apartment in a very nicely executed sequence  
the big hit of the title refers to a kidnapping that happens a quarter of the way through the film  
needing cash  cisco devises a plan to kidnap the daughter  china chow  of wealthy japanese industrialist jiro nishi  
however  the daughter is also the goddaughter of paris  avery brooks   who is ciscos and melvins boss  
infuriated and insufferable  paris commands cisco to uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping  
during his investigation  cisco singles out melvin as the ringleader  and paris orders his capture and execution  
melvin must now find a way to stay alive  
by the way  do you know how the investigation takes place  
ciscos partner makes the ransom phone call believing that his call will not be traced because of a trace buster that prevents tracing  
but  mr  nishi has a trace buster buster  
to counter that  ciscos partner has a trace buster buster buster  
but nishi has a trace buster buster buster buster  
and so on    
there is no doubt that this is an interesting world in which they live  
and there are lots of issues that wed like to know more about  
how does melvin justify his profession to his fiancee  
what goes on among this clique  
why is cisco at odds with melvin  
there is actually a lot of potential material that could have been explored  but it seems that no effort is made to go in that direction  and instead we are given a notsoengrossing plot filled with oneliners  silly sight gags  extraneous subplots and tomfoolery  
and  i havent even mentioned his financees visiting parents who want them to separate  nor melvins mistress  nor the pimplefaced video clerk demanding the return of an overdue video and on and on and on  
if the big hit signals the future of hong kong style movies that are made for american audiences  then shoot me now

0	"i dont expect much from eddie murphy these days  
for the past four years  the gods of cinemaor the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerateshave allowed him to make one bad movie after another  
such films as metro  doctor dolittle  holy man  life  and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washedup hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures  
the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film  nutty professor ii  the klumps  
the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump  an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places  
sherman has just invented a new  youth drink  that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time  
janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor  and for the most ridiculous reasons   
with love on his mind  sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego  buddy love from the first professor  who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers  
with some convoluted mumbojumbo about dna extraction  sherman extracts the  buddy love  link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handydandy lab beaker  
but one night  the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated    
because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy  
then the klump family  all played by eddie murphy  step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex  flabby breasts  a slew of fart and dick jokes  and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes  
and did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster  
the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world  with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene  
pure and simple  the klumps is a failure  
its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters  and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes  
any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process  
its more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz  the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade  american pie  have their names stamped to this trash  
hey guys  quick note  keep this movie off of your resumes  
the characterization of shermans family  the klumps  is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema  
everyone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough  
the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts  
the father is gruff  is fired from a bluecollar job  is sexually inadequate  and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings  
the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone  
the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood  
sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to  
but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy  
the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct  
and you got the feeling that these crass people couldnt act like this all the time  
the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt  making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic  
after a while  their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story  
its also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker  who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london  and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line  
even the best effects cant seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days  
now that i think about it  the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make  
people will be lined up around the block for it  
the studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002  
eddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles  but hell play every character in the movie  
i just cant wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself

1	"50s aliens vs  
earth idea revamped  
if you have been following the movie news over the net  you could not have escaped the hype over id4  
it promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary  
id4 opened in the us on 2nd of july  and up till now  only after a week of release  it has nearly touched the us100 million mark  a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993  
the premise of the movie is disgustingly simple  earth defends itself against the aliens  a typical and highly popular 50s hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era  
the movie opens via star wars  however unoriginal it may be  it worked  
the aliens have sent a large mother ship  supposedly to be 14 size of the moon  to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth  
the us president  pullman  does not know of the aliens intention but soon finds out when david  goldblum  a scientist  discovers that the aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack on all the major cities  
capt  hiller  smith   a hotshot f18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc  
his squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders  he crash lands after a spectacular 1on1 chase over the grand canyon  one of the many highlights of the movie  
id4 features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses  
acting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle  do we smell a bit of braveheart here     
no prizes for guessing how id4 ends  its just plain obvious  
id4 borrows heavily from star wars  return of the jedi  alien and in some parts of the movie  i could even sense a bit of xfiles on screen  
if i were to critically review this movie  id4 is full of plot holes  corny dialogue  and ridiculously dumb aliens  
however below that waferthin plot and onscreen flaws  id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion  
an idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie  thus maintaining a screenviewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable  no matter how ridiculous  
id4 was produced under a modest budget of us68 million  a film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich  universal soldier  stargate  and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company  
some of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable  especially the epic standoff between 150 f18s and 250 alien saucers  reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi  
id4 is a movie for all  
though there are many explosions and implied deaths  there are no gory scenes of human destruction  thus young kids should be able to take it  
sit back and dont be too critical  chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was  
if you are not planning to watch any movies this year  please  at least make time for this one  
this film is best watched on the bigscreen

0	"even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor  his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality  
like everyone else  dreyfuss has bills to pay  so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies  
consequently  while his career highlights include jaws  close encounters of the third kind  stakeout  and tin men  his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador  let it ride  and now krippendorfs tribe  
let me start out by saying that krippendorfs tribe is occasionally funny  although never riotously so   but thats about its only asset  
the best word to describe this film is  asinine   
the target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes  which are aimed at someone going through puberty  
krippendorfs tribe tries to be a zany  offthewall comedy  but the film makers have forgotten three important rules  
the first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist  
the second is that viewers should be able to identify with  or at least care about  a character or two  
finally  and most importantly  more than 5 of the jokes have to work  
once upon a time  james krippendorf  dreyfuss  was a respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college  
he and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a  lost tribe  somewhere in the wilds of new guinea  a goal which they never accomplished  
shortly after their return from the failed trip  krippendorfs wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children  shelly  natasha lyonne   mickey  gregory smith   and edmund  carl michael linder   on his own  
now  over a year later  the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf  which he has spent not on research  but on things for his family   so they send a new member of their faculty  professor veronica micelli  jenna elfman   to inform him that he has been scheduled to give a lecture on his findings  
when he arrives at the college for the momentous event  rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds  he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe  the  shelmikedmu   
to provide video footage  he films his children dressed in native garb  
soon  much to krippendorfs surprise  the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon  
but one disaffected professor  lily tomlin  is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud  
the only way krippendorfs tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters  not to mention the viewers  are dumber than dirt  
unfortunately  its impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this  
director todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags  
meanwhile  attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture  i  e   how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend  come across as feeble and derivative  
the acting in underwhelming  
dreyfuss has definitely not given his  all  to the role of james krippendorf  
alongside him  jenna elfman  the spunky costar of tvs dharma and greg  radiates perkiness and little else  
this quality  while fine for a 22minute television program  quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a featurelength movie  
no one in the supporting cast  lily tomlin  david ogden stiers  natasha lyonne  woody allens daughter in everyone says i love you   excels  
i know that a movies in trouble when its half the length of titanic  but seems much longer  
most of what comes on screen is generic sitcom level material  the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set  
if theres any upside  its that i dont see much boxoffice support developing for this lame  illmarketed miscue  
krippendorfs tribe will quickly become extinct

1	"whew  this film oozes energy  the kind of breakneck  no holdsbarred  inyourface risktaking filmmaking that is seldom seen on screen these days  
like the marginal  motley bunch of postapocalyptic youths director danny boyle tries to depict  trainspotting veers on the edge of utter mayhem but ultimately retains its footing and control  
the result  a movie that is a delightful example of how the medium is the message  
the message  a bunch of losers with loser names  mark renton  ewan mcgregor   spud  ewan bremner   sick boy  jonny lee miller   tommy  kevin mckidd   and begbie  robert carlyle   
bored  aimless and restless  their routine consists of getting drunk at the local pub  grooving to techno or glamrock at the local disco and getting shots up the arm at the local den and procuring cash through a variety of methods  some ingenious  others plainly dumb and desperate  
not part of the daily dose if obtained  sex is a bonus  
you can find these characters as they are  foulmouthed  dirty  pathetic  ugly perhaps but definitely interesting  in irvin welshs cult novel of the same name  
what makes the film a completely different experience is how director boyle uses every tool at his disposal to make the filmic medium synchronous with the message  
one of the first things youll notice is how the camera seems to dart around restlessly  
itll truck into a characters pimple  just as soon as it will dolly out to an establishing shot  
distracted and curious  itll maintain a characters eyelevel or drop right to the ground to show the dopedouteyeview  
youll even find characters peering into the camera  their faces smeared across the wideangle lens  
this film camera is just another one of the guys  
tiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy and reality  boyle employs a healthy dose of surrealism to get the message across  
bored kids daydream and bored kids deprived of a heroin fix have nightmares  
i dont want to give too much away  but if you cross chuckie from childs play with some of the wacky fantasies in heavenly creatures  you might have an idea just how fun or pantswetting scary the alternate state of consciouness can be  
that said  this film has a good share of drugs  consumed  vomitted  defecated  pissed off  exchanged  bought  sold  injected  smuggled  enjoyed and regretted  
if that isnt your cup of tea  nobody forced you to see the film  
stay at home and rent up close and personal  
and whats a buzz without tunes  
from pulp to iggy pop  yes  hes still alive   the aural landscape is as engaging as the visual energy permeating the film  
good and bad vibrations tangle like the conflicting desires and values of the message  
every once in a while  a film comes along with the kind of energetic filmmaking that matches the intensity of its characters it hopes to depict  
trainspotting is that shooting star that burns across a sky littered with static constellations  
dom is a parttime filmmaker who graduated from northwestern universitys radiotvfilm programme not too long ago  
he has laboured on various music videos and short films in and around campus and chicago  
nowhere town  a 26min short film that he shot  codirected and coproduced recently scooped up the grand jury prize at the charleston international film festival for best student production

1	"  a man is not a man without eight taels of gold   
starring sammo hung  sylvia chang  directed by mabel cheung  written by cheung and alex law  cinematography by bill wong 
eight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story and at some point becomes a love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love  
neither aspect of the movie is entirely successful  but both are good enough  
and along the way there is one perfect scene  which is one more than you find in most films  
slim  played by portly sammo hung  better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies  is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york  
when the movie opens  we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver  
he does not seem particularly out of place  
in fact  he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years  spending most of his life savings in the process  and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water  as he realizes that you can never go home  
he brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters  cheap sunglasses  and lobsters  which have to be large  to prove theyre american  the tokens of his success  
he also wears a gold chain and a gold watch  because without eight taels of gold  a man is not a man  my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east  and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb   
he loses most of this stuffexcept the goldwhen his van crashes into a river and he has to hitch a ride  so to speak  on a raft along the river which runs past his parents village  
when he arrives unannounced  he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father  
all of this has the makings of a routine comedy  and the movie has its amusing moments  as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming  and they all give him birds  so by evenings end he is surrounded by turkeys  ducks  geese and other sundry fowl  
but eight taels is not a comedyit is a sad  sweet story about the choices people make  and how they are sometimes irreparable  
director mabel cheung  an autumns tale  the soong sisters  sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in a country on the other side of the worldwhat it is like to no longer have a place to call home  
slim does not belong in china  nor does he belong in america  where he can barely speak the language  
seeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village  we come to know the world slim left behind  and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time  and wishes it felt more like home  
the condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed  i  being one  was sympathetic  
on his way to his parents village  slim hooks up with jenny  sylvia chang   whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed oddsandends  which is what he continues to call her  although she is now a mature  professional  attractive woman  to be married in the spring to an americanchinese man  
slim and oddsandends fall for each other  
thats predictable  
the manner in which their  non  romance is played out is not  
the emotions involved are adult and complex  and the film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma  
its typical  for instance  that the fianc  in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk  because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover  
but here the fianc  is a decent  ordinary guy  and although slim would like to feel anger  he cannot  
the fianc  has done nothing wrong  the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions  take your pick  
eight taels has its share of flaws  the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak   but it compensates with insight  
when oddsandends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco  she notes resignedly   its all the same  
wherever we go  well be in chinatown   and her straightforward statement expresses much  
there is insight  too  in the understanding of the consequences of slim and oddsandends decisions  he to move to america  she to marry a chineseamerican  
both their choices were perhaps born of impatience  perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greenerand it turns out that both choices were wrong  
but they cannot undo them  they must live with what they have done  
such is life  
the movie is tender toward these people  but it offers no false comforts  
everything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene  which is the culmination of the love story  
slim and oddsandends sit in a secluded spot and talk hesitantly  with the muted poppop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them  and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss  
the exchange that follows  and what slim then does  is poignant and perfect  with clarity and understatement  we see two peoples lives  their heartbreaks and virtues  summed up in a single moment  
yes  the film is flawed  but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies  
"
1	"i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials  but there isnt  
george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant  special effectsbound flicks and he has done it again  
this is the first star wars film ive seen on the big screen  so  of course  the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video  
what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story  but its amazing visuals  
basically  the films plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets  
quigon  liam neeson  and his young apprentice obiwan kenobi  ewan mcgregor  set out with the animated jarjar binks to fix the mess that may result in war  
when their ship breaks down and they are stranded  they find a young boy  anakin skywalker  jake lloyd  and his slave mother  
quigon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing  
anakin participates in a heartpounding podrace  one of the highlights of the film  to get the equipment needed to fix quigons ship  
however  most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy  
meanwhile  queen amadala  natalie portman  is frustrated and at wits end  being na  ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders  
there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training  the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb  
this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made  
in all the star wars films  human emotions that we  the audience  can identify with are usually nil  but the films are for pure enjoyment  not for uplifting purposes  
despite the fun of watching the movie  the phantom menace is not without flaws  
for starters  we have the illconceived  moronic character jarjar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience  
what a klutz  
george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as  say  yoda  r2d2  or c3po  but  alas  his efforts were in vain  
secondly  this may be good or bad  depending on your point of view   the movies atmosphere is so different from the familiar comicbook feel of the previous three star wars installments  
this is due  perhaps  to the utter complexity to this movies plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here  
the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions  
i cant say much about the acting  though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway  
however  there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances they are straightforward and  at times  stale  
natalie portman has a great presence  but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic  unfeeling  enigma  
there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance  
jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk  
despite the inevitable faults  there is so much to enjoy about the movie  
the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesnt quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes  but they are amazing and edgeofyourseat fun in their own rite  
the film is a treasure to look at  
the visual effects are astonishing 99  8 of the time the aweinspiring  mouthopening  eyepopping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius  
not since 1997s the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one  
the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element  the previous star wars movies  kubricks 2001  maybe even of fritz langs classic silent metropolis  
however  all the sets are so original  
the original star wars movies cant even match the grandeur of this films visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode  
the costumes are remarkable and have jeanpaul gaultier written all over them  
whether its queen amadalas gigantic wardrobe complete with goldembroidery and feathers  or the jedis simple brown uniforms  the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness  
the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie  
as for john williams score  i dont think hes done one as complex or powerful since  i cant even remember  
it is as epic as his schindlers list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws  
it includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films  but williams has added on  made the music much more intense and moving  
what with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie  one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed  
there is very little to hate in the film  its a very accomplished and skillfully made flick  
it is the best  fun  film and the best bigbudget film out today  most definitely  
"
0	"so i went and saw this film right  it was called  battlefield  earth   i was never interested in the previews  and never too terribly interested in the book  nor do i find scientology interesting  but after reading advanced reviews of how bad this film really is  i had that weird urge just to watch it  
well let me be the first to say  and so far in my view its safe to say  battlefield  earth might be the worst film i have ever seen  yes even worse than  mr  magoo    blue in the face   or  jaws  the revenge   
roger christianson whos credits include set direction  and art direction for such great films as  alien  and  star wars   directs this film with such amateurism  that the film looks and feels and in fact sounds so dumb  that its quite depressing  
the look of the film  is dark and drabby at times  but then bright and happy at other times  
the sound is terrible  and has the worst surround sound effects ive heard  
the acting is nothing  the dialogue poor  and the makeup effects hideous  
heres the socalled plot  earth 3000     man is a endangered species  while aliens from the planet psychlo  the aliens are named psychlo    i 
wonder why    are invading earth  destined to put an end to those  mananimals  to an end  and destroy earth once and for all  of course we have our typical hero  played terrible by barry pepper  who was great in a small role in 1999s  the green mile   who is destined to go out  and save his planet  
one thing  he has to go up against  terl  the chief of security psychlo  who is played frankly  quite bad by john travolta  whom with dreadlocks  a big head  and green eyes just doesnt work  
of course the sidekick to terl  is played by  lol    
forest whitaker  who looks like a deformed werewolf of some kind  
our friendly human johnny  barry pepper  looks just as bad as well  with long scraggly hair  
im not really sure how to quite explain the badness of this film  except just to say its terrible  
everything in this film is imcomprehinsable  from the makeup effects  which by the way arent good  to the phony looking special effects  everything in this film is faulted  
in fact i dont remember one part in this entire movie where i was having a good time  or enjoying myself  
in fact there is no part in the movie that i liked or enjoyed  
throughout the entire 127 minute running time  i was dying  constantly looking at my watch  and hoping maybe the projectioner would blow a bulb or something  sadly it didnt  
my advice to hollywood  get new scripts  new acting classes  better directors and damnit  make films like american beauty more  
"
1	"im not really sure what to think about  crash   
on the surface  its a cold  boring  unerotic porn with name starts  a name director  and some cool camerawork  
i mean  it left me completely bored  unsatisfied  and generally kinda weirded out  
but then again  not every films supposed to leave you entertained  
  crash  is structured to play like a porn flick  but with significantly more plot and dialogue  
while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex  we also have a skimpy little plot going on  mostly towards the beginning   and maybe just a hair of characterization  
not to mention the acting is generally pretty good  and we dont really see a lot of the actors completely exposed  
but what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience  
this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of  henry and june  or the just plain horniness of  say   deep throat   not that ive seen it   
if one was to be made completely hot by this film  it would probably mean they were also into the whole  auto eroticism  thing  
the film leaves you cold erotically  and maybe in many other ways   but what it does is present a group of people who live on the edge  
the film opens up on a woman  catherine  deborah kara ungar  of  the game    pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air hangar  
suddenly  a man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind  the film doesnt show all this though  even if it is nc17   
the next scene has a film director  james  james spader   having sex with a camera woman  alice poon  in an office on the highlypopulated set of his movie  
the next scene has the two coming together  revealing to us that theyre husband and wife  and them sharing in one anothers escapades  
while the two are arguably freaky people  we at least know they love to live on the edge  
soon afterwards  james is driving down the road at night  reclessly of course  hes reading something   when he drifts into the other lane  and then hits another car face on  
james is not killed  but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat  obviously dying   leaving the driver  helen remington  holly hunter  in a porn    also alive  
the two go through therapy together  and when getting out  they run into eachother again  
when james gives her a ride home  they almost get into another accident  and immeadiately afterwards  they go to an unbusy parking lot  and have a little quickie  as they were aroused by the accident  
you wouldnt think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish  but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan  elias kosteas  and his crutchcarrying girlfriend  gabrielle  rosanna arquette   who are also into it  
vaughan is into living on the edge as they are  but he takes it to another level  he loves to recreate famous car crashes  
in one scene  he and a friend  colin seagrave  peter macneill  recreate james deans car crash without any padding or safety belts  and suffer some concussions  but nevertheless get a rush  and the attention of the police   
soon  these five are all having sex with one another  be it straight  gay  or lesbian sex  
while this is admittingly all a bit comical  the film is almost like a black comedy   the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people whos main fetish is living on the edge  
im sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents  but i personally dont see a connection between car crashes and sex  
the main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush  
his car crash scenes are quick and exciting minimasterpieces  were at first not sure if theyll take place  but everytime it looks like it may occur  we gasp  
then when it happens  we hold our breath  
the same thing happens with sex  although not in the same fashion  
these people are merely taking it to another level  
the only problem with the film is that its a tad redundant  
a normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half  
this goes on for about 100 minutes  and it just seems a little too long  
the sex and car crashes are far between one another  and the time between them are a tad on the boring side  
theres no characterization  although it could definitely be argued  that hey  its a porn  and were not here to sympathize  
but still  they coulda cut it down a bit  
but the film is saved with its presentation  as well as some other elements  
the atmosphere is very dark and forboding  creating a kind of cool weird feeling  
and there are several scenes are just amazing  
one scene has catherine and james having sex  while she softly asks him questions about being with a man  which sounds almost erotic the way she says it  
a sequence involving one characters death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs  
and the final shot is shot perfectly  creating an image of a car crash  and a couple having sex in front of it  despite the fact that shes wounded  
the acting is also pretty good  especially for what is almost a porn  ousting linda lovelace as best actress in a porn   
while james spader is pretty boring  hes usually pretty intense   deborah kara ungar is amazing  
she speaks all her words in almost zombielike hushes  and when shes having sex  she has a blank look on her face  not showing the viewer whether shes enjoying it or not  
in one scene  she actually looks dead while someone is having sex with her  
holly hunter  who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this  is pretty good  and so is rosanna arquette  who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her role   
but the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone  
he often speaks as he is out of breath  showing a definite affinity for his way of life  
he has a great deal of energy in several scenes  especially one scene where hes taking photographs of a picture  and a later scene where hes getting a freaky tatoo  
he and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes  foreshadowing a later scene  
kosteas is a little known actor  his biggest role was casey jones in  teenage mutant ninja turtles    but here he shows a denirolike presence  hinting that hes capable of bigger roles  
while i hardly enjoyed  crash   its still a pretty intriguing portrayal of a group of people who  if the exist  are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world  
these people are able to share a rush between two completely different entities  and the film  which doesnt exactly pain them in a negative light  is sucessful in bringing them to light  even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out  
despite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc17 rating  theres also an rrated version  but i wouldnt even go near that thing   anyone looking for a quick turnon should just rent a regular porno  
"
1	"satirical films usually fall into one of two categories  1  longterm satire where everything  including the jokes  is somehow related on a large scale  i  e  
  dr  
strangelove   2  situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene  i  e  
  men in black    
whats unique about  wag the dog  is that it doesnt necessarily fit either of these descriptions  and yet is both at the same time  
the result is a clever comedy based on an original  smart premise  even if the focus does tend to wander a bit  
if theres anything that affects americans the most its politics and showbusiness  
in this age of information and technology  weve been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things  its gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it  
we need the media to bring us the most uptodate news  but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking  
this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas  and then presents an interesting scenario  if politics  the media coverage of politics  and the entertainment industry are so closely related  couldnt someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all  
thats the idea conrad brean  de niro   a professional washington spin doctor  comes up with in order to restore the presidents good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election  
brean  along with the presidents top advisor  winifred ames  heche   fly to california to meet up with hotshot movie producer stanley motss  hoffman   
they pitch him an idea to  produce  the image of a war with albania  its a country no ones heard of so they people will buy it   
soon the wheels are in motion and the films riffing satire comes into play  
were inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation  such as a folk singer  visual and sound effects technicians  and a modern style expert known as the fad king  leary   
the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv  in the movies  or in the news  
the characters dialogue is witty and funny  although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcomesque  
for example  one scene shows motss and breans production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee  
motss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry  but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs  
since its all computerenhanced anyway  she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later  
this demonstrates the films ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise  
but then theres the gags and oneliners that  although are humorous  seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actresss name  or  whenever a problem emerges  always responding with   this is nothing   
by the time the film makes it to the midpoint  everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens  
the first act is quickly paced  while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film  
every ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with  and its always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it  
the screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems headon in realistic manners  
however  it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject  
as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture  
what had started off as a brilliant  somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie  
still  the situation comedy is quite funny  especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt  
willie schumann  a war hero motss and brean concocted  
truly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time  but think about afterwards and  wag the dog  at least succeeds in this respect  
however  in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done  namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes  
then again  its a valiant effort

1	"heres a word analogy  amistad is to the lost world as schindlers list is to jurassic park  
in 1993  after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit  many critics described schindlers list as the directors  penance   as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowdpleasing blockbuster   
now  after a threeyear layoff  spielberg is back with a vengeance  
once again  his summer release was special effectsloaded actionadventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers  
now  following his 1993 pattern  he has fashioned another serious  inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity  
that film is amistad  
although not as masterful as schindlers list  amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture  
thematically rich  impeccably crafted  and intellectually stimulating  the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact  
watching schindlers list was a powerful  almost spiritual  experience  
spielberg pulled us into the narrative  absorbed us in the drama  then finally let us go  exhausted and shattered  threeplus hours later  
aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since  
amistad  while a fine example of film making  is not as transcendent  
the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books  but  considering who writes the texts  thats not a surprise  
however  the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric  and  while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account  most of the basic facts are in order  
several  mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the films dramatic force  
on the whole  while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation  it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired  
one stormy night during the summer of 1839  the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape  
led by the lionhearted cinque  djimon hounsou   they take control of the vessel  killing most of the crew  
adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa  they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey  
they are tricked  however  and the la amistad  which makes its way northward off the united states eastern coastline  is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut  
the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison  charged with murder and piracy  
the first men to come to the africans defense are abolitionists theodore joadson  morgan freeman  and lewis tappan  stellan skarsgard   
they are soon joined by roger baldwin  matthew mcconaughey   a property attorney of little repute  
aided by advice from former president john quincy adams  anthony hopkins   baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for  and his central argument  that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men  not property  convinces the judge  
but powerful forces have aligned against baldwins cause  
current president martin van buren  nigel hawthorne   eager to please southern voters and 11year old queen isabella of spain  anna paquin   begins pulling strings behindthescenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free  
at its heart  amistad is a tale of human courage  
cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to  
he is a free man  not a slave  and  while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle  he will not give it up  
effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou  whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention  cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies  
they are individuals  and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movies success  
to amplify this point  spielberg presents many scenes from the africans pointofview  detailing their occasionallyhumorous observations about some of the white mans seeminglystrange  rituals   
the larger struggle is  of course  one of defining humanity  
as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as  subhuman   so the proslavery forces of amistad use a similar defense  
the abolitionists regard the africans as men  but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property  
in a sense  the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war  which would break out less than three decades later  looming over everything  
amistads presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating  making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history  
four claimants come forward against the africans  the state  which wants them tried for murder  the queen of spain  who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an americanspanish treaty  two american naval officers  who claim the right of high seas salvage  and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad  who demand that their property be returned to them  
baldwin must counter all of these claims  while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque  
even though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier  they gradually learn to communicate  
aside from cinque  who is a fullyrealized individual  characterization is spotty  but the acting is topnotch  
matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his  pretty boy  image to become baldwin  but the lawyer is never particularly welldefined outside of his role in the la amistad case  
likewise  while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan  they are never anything more than  abolitionists   
nigel hawthorne  who played the title character in the madness of king george  presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election  
finally  theres anthony hopkins  whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done  
hopkins  who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer  an emotionallycrippled english butler  and richard nixon  makes us believe that he is adams  
his tenminute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable  
one point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindlers list is this films lack of a welldefined human villain  
schindlers list had ralph fiennes superblyrealized amon goeth  who was not only a threedimensional character  but a personification of all that the nazis stood for  
there is no such figure in amistad  
the villain is slavery  but an ideology  no matter how evil  is rarely the best adversary  
it is to spielbergs credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist  
amistads trek to the screen  which encountered some choppy waters  author barbara chaseriboud has cried plagiarism  a charge denied by the film makers   comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident  
an opera of the same name opened in chicago on november 29  1997  
numerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves  
it remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has  but one thing is certain  with spielbergs rousing  substantive film leading the way  the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history

0	"i have a confession  
even though i am a movie junkiei saw eye of the beholder and yet i still watch moviesive never seen any of the original godzillas  
  note that godzilla 2000 is not a sequel to the u  s  godzilla released in 1998  its the american release of a 1999 godzilla flick called gojira nisen mireniamu   
so  part of me was excited as i drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla 2000the latest entry in an almost 50year old franchise  
this was a longawaited treat  
i was expecting a goofy good time  complete with bad dubbing  science fair level sets and a ludicrous plot line  
the last thing i expected was for the movie to be so  boring  
i can only imagine what the theatre full of kids i saw this with felt  
you do get all of the  so bad theyre good  traits so normally associated with the franchise  
but you have to sit through a snoozer plot that has the organization of a rorschach blot  
its a deal i wasnt willing to accept  
hiroshi kashiwabara and waturu mimuras script crams in way too many details  and in many cases  fails to follow up on them  
the maneuver is not only disconcerting  but gives the movie a permanent logy  weighty feel  
godzilla starts off destroying power plants and then just stops  
was it a whim  
a bold political statement  
i dont know  
its foe  an ancient meteor that looks like prudentials logo  doesnt just fight the beast from the far east  
no  its got to have lifesaving powers  a plot to erase  the data  from japan  a desire to clone and the ability to become a spaceship and then some kind of tentacled space creature  
theres a battle between the head of the godzilla prediction unit  takehiro murata  and a slimy government official  hiroshi abe  over the handling of godzilla  and personal issues  
and then theres the plucky news photographer and blah  blah  blah  
its like watching magnolia all over againexcept without the good writing  keen sociological insight and aimee mann songs  
what a waste  
when the talking and the plot points stop hurtling at you  godzilla 2000 does the jobits entertaining and goes down easy  
the action scenes are cheesy in their grandeur though a little sluggish  
the dubbing is nice and awful  with murata sounding like hes in constant need of a cough drop  
as for the dialogue  one line summarizes the goofiness factor   did anyone see that flying rock go by   
this movie also marked the first time since the three stooges that ive heard the word  imbecile  used in casual conversation  
though the summer movie season is drying up and godzilla 2000 has its moments  i wouldnt take kids to see it  
theyll probably end up asking more questions than charlie rose

0	"when i ponder childhood memories past  one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the  inspector gadget  tv show with my older brother  
truth be told  we were rabid fanatics  our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune  alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr  claw  the inspectors arch nemesis  
i was never a biggie on nostalgia  but you just cant help but have fond memories of something like that  
sometimes i even find myself up at 4am watching reruns of my favorite episodes  trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid  
at the very least  i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me  
despite how horrid a film may be  the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up  
so back i sat  with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver  lets face it  exactly how good can a liveaction disney film really be    
i was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr  magoo and george of the jungle  two previous disney adaptations   and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well  
rarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness  
as everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind  i was left sitting there  absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen  
can something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world  
right from the beginning  i knew i was in trouble  
in the opening scenes  each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be  to simply serve as reallife duplicates of their cartoon clones  
when referring to them  people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be   oh  hi penny  
is brain with you     
creating onedimensional replicas is one thing  having mere names take the place of them is quite another  
the  plot   shall we call it  stays fairly in tune with the original series  
matthew broderick stars as john brown  how creative is that    
a security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex  why  rupert everett  for the love of god why         who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events  
brown is then rescued and used as a prototype for a new lawenforcement technology wherein hes joined with various machine parts and some nifty gadgets to form  drumroll  please     
inspector gadget  
from here on out  the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog and confusing situations  although  to be fair  my confusion could have been caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind   
theres something about an evil gadget taking over the city  his first crime must have been swiping matt dillons dentures from theres something about mary  and it all ends with  what else   a bunch of postcredit nonsense and a cameo by don adams himself  
to be honest  i wasnt much paying attention to these  treats   
i was just glad that it was over

0	"you dont need to have seen the original  species  to appreciate how utterly lousy  species ii  is  
with few exceptions  sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them  but the fact that  species ii  is a followup isnt the only reason its so miserable  
its the predictable storyline  the cardboard characters  the banal dialogue  the failed attempts at humor  the revolting special effects  the gratuitous nudity  all female  of course   the bad acting  and the bland direction  
the plot  simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc  involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle  
the slime  well  sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black  
that should have been the end of the movie right there  
back on terra firma  at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and  as youll remember if you saw the first movie  driven by a strong urge to procreate  
on a parallel track  government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film  now called eve  again  played  by natasha henstridge  and are keeping her around for some testing  
this  apparently  includes observing eves reaction to  the dukes of hazzard  tv show  which she appears to enjoy  
eves biorhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk  mates   which we are forced to witness in grossout detail  but otherwise there doesnt appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film  unless it was written into her contract  lets hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only   
eve finally breaks free of her confinesand her brafor the finale  but the effects are so messy you cant really see whats going on  
peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams  i told em not to go   
at the top of his lungs  referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle  
michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox  so that he can enter high security areas  flash a badge and claim to be press  maybe    as does marg helgenberger as dr  laura baker  the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns  
theyre both unbelievably wooden  
whats a talented filmmaker like peter medak   the ruling class    the krays    let him have it   doing directing this tripe  i wonder  
its an unfortunate trend  this  oncetalented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like  species ii   
last year peter hyams gave us  the relic   no thanks necessary there  
and the first  species  was helmed by roger donaldson who  although certainly no genius behind the camera  had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects  
is it just that there are no better offers out there  
  species ii  is worthless  
worse than that  its also exploitative  offensive  and insulting to the intelligence at every turn  
its not that there isnt anything positive to say about the film  
there is  
after 92 minutes  it ends

0	"my son and i share a perverse predilection for bad movies  
we are amused and entertained by the cheap thrills  the corny dialog  the ludicrous premises and the bad acting  
since other family members aspire to higher forms of entertainment  we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together  
i cant remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of a clunker until species 2 came along  
he was not amused  
i on the other hand was able to easily suspend the applicable requirements in the usual manner and declare myself suitably entertained  
perhaps the evident skills that were brought to the process of producing a bad product was what prevented him from extracting fun out of mediocrity  
i on the other hand appreciated the fact that the producers and director knew exactly what they were doing  insulting my intelligence  and brought adequate moviemaking skills to the project a movie does not have to be good to be well made  at least in terms of the craft  
the movie could have been better if it were not so brusque  
this movie slaps you with conception  pregnancy  delivery and young childhood in consecutive frames  without pausing for infancy  
the producers of nescafe have nothing on this alien race in which a womans womb balloons immediately after the male orgasm  and a few seconds later a young child tears its way out of her abdomen in a sloppy and gory version of an insideout cesarean  
an autopsy scene in which a buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the kind of indulgence that i condone  to say nothing of the fact that it was scientifically incorrect  
in a real autopsy the saw does not cut through the scalp  it is used only after the skull has been exposed  
the opening sequences of exploration of mars were very good  
the writers showed excellent skills for ceremonial speech writing but the spontaneous dialogue would qualify for a subtitle  as bad as it gets  
as the movie progressed i vowed to remember the lines that made me cringe but only one stuck  
eve  natasha henstridge  was cloned from sil  the original alien sexual predator  but her mating instinct was artificially attenuated  which was all that was needed to turn her into a noble and cooperative prisoner  
in a wistful display of resignation and understanding she tells her friend and jailer  marg helgenberger   i think of all the places that i will never see and all the people that i will never meet   
its enough to melt the most callous heart  
at another point she protests  im human too  you know   
she is only half right  
peter medak  the director  knows his business  
justin lazard as the doomed astronaut does nothing to enhance his hollywood credentials  
james cromwell  his father  is perfect in a short role  
marg heldenberger  the dna scientist is pleasant and beautiful  
natasha is an exquisite ornament  
george dzunza knew and delivered what was expected of him as the dumb general that messes things up  
michael madsen was there  
black buddies do not usually survive in this type of movie but mykelti williamson manages to stay around for the final credits  which is more that we can say for lazard

1	"the truman show  paramount pictures  running time  1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait  jim carreys dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen  
in case youve been asleep for the last few months  the plot centres on truman burbank  carrey  who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven  
his life seems so perfect  however  because its controlled by christoff  harris  creator of the truman show  the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of  
thats right  burbanks life is being broadcast live to the american public  and seahaven and all its inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage  
the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far    
with an idea so different  it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator  
luckily  the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages  yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie  
talking of carrey  hes perfect in this movie  enjoying the best role in his career  
his character is a reinforced stanley ipkiss from the mask  1994  and is completely suited to carreys persona  
he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode  shrieking and being silly  but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey  
hes not completely dramatic like the film promises  however  
ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff  the megalomaniac creator of the show  
quiet and well spoken  he burns an image into the viewer  
unfortunately  hes barely in the film  and for the first hour dosent appear at all  
also disappointing is natascha mcelhones character sylvia  
she plays the role well  but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her  
the supporting cast is excellent  and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect  so perfect its creepy  
the philip glass soundtrack is also superb  and is used to great effect during the film  
peter weir keeps the film going  clearly having fun  
the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card  
although it is slightly slow to begin with  about half an hour into film the pace really picks up  and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll  
sadly  though  the film is practically over when the film is in full steam  
also  concerning the ending  it is slightly too ambiguous  which was disappointing  
the screenwriter  andrew niccol  who bought us gattaca  1997  delivers an entertaining script  and manages to keep the plot in trim  
while christoffs plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly  they never go over the line  which would have been easy for niccol to do  
also  theres some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show  
overall  the truman show is excellent entertainment  
certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces  it should be viewed by everyone  
it offers something to every member of the audience  and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed  
overall rating

1	"the seasoned capt  dudley smith  james cromwell  questions his new protege  ed exley  guy pearce  about his political views when it comes to police work  
  would you plant evidence to get a conviction if you knew the person to be guilty  
would you shoot a man in the back if you knew that it was the only way to make sure he got what he deserved   
exley  squeaky clean  innocent  and pent with the desire to perform his new duties with integrity and honesty quickly answers with a pointed no   
stunned  smith pleads   then  for the love of god  dont be a detective   
la confidential is a dandy piece of filmmaking that brings us back to the classic times of hollywood in the 50s  
organized crime was the biggest concern  corruption existed everywhere  and every cop had his own way of getting the job done  
there was  hollywood  jack vincennes  kevin spacey  who gets most of his information from the editor of a sleazy tellallshowall tabloid  sid hudgeons  danny devito   
sporting dark sunglasses and a white sports coat  he isnt afraid to flash his tinseltown style  
detective bud white  russell crowe  has only a narrowminded view of the law  and he uses excessive force to exact his unique kind of interrogation and brutal justice  
and then there is golden boy exley  wideeyed and ambitious but extremely naive  
a horrible multiple murder begins to draw these three men together  each of whom become inexorably connected in their search for truth  action  and personal vindication  
almost immediately  an arrest is made  
but something doesnt seem quite right  
new developments become sinuous as the story begins to draw us deeper into the labyrinth of corruption and crime within the department  
suspicion and questions begin to mount  
odd alliances are created  
and as layers of the truth become revealed  the story grows more complex and intriguing by the moment  
when the mystery expands  we see other seemingly guilty characters enter the lives of these three cops  including a highpriced hooker  kim basinger  and a shady millionaire  david strathairn   
all of the characters levels of involvement are not immediately clear  
we watch with riveted fascination to learn more about why they are there and their stake in the case  
we sense a crosspollination of clues that brings us  the audience  closer to the truth  
we hope that the three detectives can throw away their spite for one another and can pull their resources together in order to untangle the intricately created web of mystery  
absorbing and affecting  this movie has all the necessary ingredients to create a terrific gourmet serving of film noir  
it boasts mysterious figures in control  doublecrosses  hard information from sleazy sources  dirty politicians  corrupt cops  haunting women  and hardnosed cops experiencing moral ambiguity  
the underlying mystery is compelling  
the look and feel of the movie is gorgeous  
the entire cast is crisp and wonderful to watch  i wouldnt be surprised if cromwell received an oscar nomination for his performance   
and  the dialogue is rich and memorable  
the best line of the movie is spoken when a key player dispenses advice to one of the detectives unsure of what to do  
  dont start trying to do the right thing  boyo   says he  
  you havent had the practice   
  l  a  confidential triumphantly achieves the rare gift of complexity and coherence while satisfying our desire for a good oldfashioned movie

0	"absolute power  the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood  attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff  
it is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper  
one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood  
not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived  but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence  
continually underestimating the audience  the film gives us information we already know or dont even need  
details essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying  like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two nightvision goggles in their car    
oddly enough  the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities  
a masterful jewelthief  played by clint eastwood  witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire  played by e  g  
marshall   
while robbing one of marshalls mansions  he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault  
there  through a twoway mirror  he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay  
their game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman  
in self defense  the woman grabs a letteropener and stabs the man in the elbow  
she raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men  
the man  
he is the president of the united states of america  
where does the film go wrong  
it cannot be the acting  
clint eastwood  ed harris and gene hackman as the president give typecast  but decent performances  
the cinematography is sufficient  wild and erratic during action sequences  dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes  and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue  
even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thrillersuspense genre  
the fault clearly lies in the screenplay  and the screenplay alone  
while setting up a story about misuse of power  about the true possessors of that power  and about intrigue and doublecrossing  it does not resolve it  
not one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax  
rather  the tense situations are left dangling at the end  giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness  
an example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene  in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood  the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant  
police officers are everywhere  incognito of course  
at the same time  not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives  
all three parties are unaware of each others presence  
this scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood  who might suspect this is a trap  will get himself out of this difficult position  
he will probably have a brilliant plan  involving ingenious preparations  
however  when he arrives at the trap  both hit men miss  how convenient  and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away  
the buildup of this scene took about ten minutes  
ten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap  
the scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds    
parallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter  
the daughter blames her father for never being there for her  because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere  
of course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family  
again  it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a dramatic subplot  
however  trying is simply not enough  
the second story line should be subtle  original and preferably unpredictable    
everything this film is not  
how could a screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding to be produced  
how could eastwood  who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven  ever believe in a project like this one  
i am sad to say that my respect for the actordirectorproducer has diminished substantially due to this film  
director quentin tarantino once said   i can make a good movie out of any bad script   
director clint eastwood obviously cannot

juxtaposing the samurais honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the americanitalian mafia  it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptors precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber  dinosaurlike  to function in the modern era  
director jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast  ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit  
using a palate of bleached colors  jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film  
he doesnt cater to audience expectations of hypercolorized  stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies  
the action is presented in flat  brutal codas  
bullets have permanence  
death has consequences  
the movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty  
it is an antimovie  of sorts  
there are few photogenic  empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with  
this isnt a film that lovingly holds your hand  
there are dark  contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder  just so  asserting itself for all to see  
the fulcrum for the movies thematic balancing act is ghost dog  a mafia hitman  
a twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer  ghost dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms  
unlike the sleek  muscular killing machines one is accustomed to  we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly  replete with chapped  dirty hands and rumpled clothing  
he wears a hooded sweatshirt  which he often pulls over his head  giving him a monklike appearance  
there are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal  
he uses old  worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical  efficient and pleasureless fashion  
ghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai  distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a book  which he reads daily  hagakure  the way of the samurai  
life consists of simple pleasures for him  ice cream  warm rooftop naps and good books  
ghost dog lives  as it were  by the basic tenet expressed by his book  one should start each day considering oneself as dead  
living atop an abandoned building  surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons  ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends  
he craves nothing more  
as he puts it late in the film   ive seen all i want to see   
he exists in a spiritual world of the mind  gaining moral sustenance from his readings  
ghost dog wasnt always as he is presented  
in several roshomonlike flashbacks  its shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan  that  samaritan  being a foot soldier in an aging crime family  
ghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man  louie  tormey   as repayment  
after years of loyal service  ghost dog is sent  by louie  to kill  handsome frank   a made man within louies organization who has run away with the crime bosss daughter  louise  vessey   
ghost dog wordlessly executes his task  witnessed by louise  whom he spares  as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon  clutching a copy of the book  roshomon  
in a bit of synchronicity  louise loans the book to ghost dog  
upset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family  the mob bosses  in turn  put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade  
the rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict  
the theme of old cartoons flares up time and again  each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dogs world  
each time a character is shown watching a cartoon  its from the same era  betty boop  felix the cat  etc   a reflection of days gone by  
near the end  louise is watching a cartoon thats a departure from the previously shown ones  
its a bit of audacity on jarmuschs part that is nicely effective  despite its surrealistic nature  
as ghost dog floats through his world  his life is touched by two people  
one is a sage little girl  winbush  who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading  
she comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities  just as louise ultimately does  
by films end  the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer  
the other person in ghost dogs world is an ice cream  de bankole  vendor who only speaks french  yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog  
the vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land  
jarmusch  through rappercomposer rza  underscores his film with rap and reggae music  which at first blush seems dichotomous  but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie  
ghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars  
  which  in and of itself  presents another paradox about ghosts dogs sense of honor   
the head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation  
of all the cartoonish mobsters  he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world  
gorman plays sonny  a lieutenant who respects the old ways  yet has a quirky affinity for rap music  a love comically shown in several impromptu displays  
ruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia  
he is a husk of a man  assisted by two hearing aids  who barks out advice without truly hearing what he  or others are saying  
whitaker carries the film by using what truly great actors use  his face  
ghost dog is reticent to speak  often going for long periods without doing so  
the fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent  
although the film has a deliberate pace  some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down  
truly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob  
he reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world  
carried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker  ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon  into a figure that garners sympathy  if not a bit of pity

0	"movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting  entertaining or convincing  because of one fundamental reason  movies are made by adults and not teenagers  
occasionally  however  films like say anything  dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called  teenagers   
cant hardly wait  however  does not  
instead  the writingdirecting team of harry elfont and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich  found in the teenage genre  strip it completely of perception  intelligence and wit  and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to  
cant hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party on the night of their high school graduation  
the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them  theres the average male protagonist preston  ethan embry   prom queen and cheerleader amanda  jennifer lovehewitt   football star mike  peter facinelli   white rapper wannabe kenny  seth green   computer geek william  charlie korsmo   and brainy outsider denise  lauren ambrose   
i couldnt stand any of those characters  
whether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming  yo  i gotta have sex tonight    
all i could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film  
apparently  cant hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy  but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that its not funny  
in all honesty  elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour  
and when i say  forced   i mean it  
they should be strapped down to a chair and have their eyes wedged open in a similar fashion to alex in a clockwork orange  
this is how desperately they need to be educated about the concept of humour  
for instance  cant hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as  i am a sex machine   
for some reason  elfont and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough  eventually it will be funny  
if only elfont and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk  now thats funny

0	"bicentennial man is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment  
chris columbus  the director who gave you  mrs  doubtfire   plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point  
based on the short story by isaac asimov  it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human  which as you can imagine is very difficult  
starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children  
soon this robot  called andrew  robin williams  shows abilities that makes his owner mr  martin  sam neill  very curious  
andrew is interested in art and music  he  enjoys  making clocks  which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions  
it shows out that because of a small failure in the  electrical circuits  and  positronic brain  andrew has accidentally gained a soul  
this makes him unique and his evil creators worried  
then mr  martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasnt programmed to do  
soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom  destiny and love  
this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner  a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction  
ever since that film  the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy  
what makes us human  
the thoughts  
the emotions  
is it possible to become human  
at what point can we say to a robot  now you are one of us   
these are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach  
it is obvious that columbus didnt take them very seriously  
when you think about it  this film is not really meditating on the question  when is a robot no longer a machine  but a human being    but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding  
andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being  and only the society has troubles with it  
in other words  it is as far from reality as from the academy awards  
further more  there are other annoying problems  
to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now  
this has not been done for obvious reasons  because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task  
columbus is the first to have crossed that line  
the result is  as you might imagine  primitive  unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort  
the world is simply frozen in time  
neither the society  fashion  culture or values have changed over 200 years  
mom is still working at the kitchen  doing the dishes  
when you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today  youll see a slightly bigger difference  
i am not saying that everything should change  
it is unlikely that the human rights will change  but its even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science  technology and fashion  
i suppose its possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale  but its really hard  
robin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way  
as always he does a decent job  as does sam neill  
but it doesnt really matter  
it is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience  
pretty much like last years  meet joe black   this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesnt deserve  
great actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten  
when isaac asimov wrote this story  the future seemed far away and magical  
everything seemed possible  
now is the future of asimovs time  and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago  
for the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius vernes  20 000 leagues under the sea   so cant we accept this story as a potential reality  
let us hope that next years  a  i   
will be more rewarding

0	"arriving in a barrage of hype  the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year  
however  like the golden child  although blair witch has made a lot of money  its not very good  
donahue  williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth  
the film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded  which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles  
although events start of normal  they get weird pretty quickly  while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on  
although an interesting premise  the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity  
the biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise  
most of the dialogue is adlibbed  and still manages to sound like a poor bmovie  
the script eventually degenerates into shouting matches  with the fword included a lot to sound like students  
there are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur  but then its back to the shouting and swearing  which gets very tiresome very quickly  
if i wanted to see three people get lost in the woods  shout a lot and swear  id go on scout camp  
but no  the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this  but im not quite sure how  
the supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting  especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes  
with no music and no budget to work with  the film has to depend on natural  psychological scares  which are sometimes well delivered  sometimes not  
i never really felt truly scared during any part of the film  although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film  
however  because the actors are so irritating  the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying what the f  ck is that   
a lot  and mike giggling like a loony  
theres also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things  
the main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment  and are hopelessly lost  heather still insists on filming it all  
the film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this  but it isnt very convincing  
also  the students have no idea how to survive in the woods  such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation  
there are also some parts where the amateur camcorder footage is obviously staged  heathers apology being a major one  
the blair witch project  in the end  just fails to deliver  
i suppose if youve been lost camping before  the film may deliver some chills  but this is no use for the other 99 of the paying audience who havent been lost in the woods  
apart from the final minutes  the film is mind boggingly unscary  and the shouting matches get hideously dull  
the spook scenes are short and far between  and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide  
although a good idea  its not executed well enough to be a fun  scary cinema experience  
its a worrying fact when the website  http  www  blairwitch  com 
  is better than the film

0	"  my name is jack carter  and you dont want to know me  says our brooding antihero  sylvester stallone   
take his advice  
to know this guy is as rewarding as being thrown over a terrace  
and to watch this film is almost as painful  
  get carter  is a gloomy looking  unimaginative film that offers no joy  
jack carter is as tough as tough guys come  
he works out of vegas as a selfdescribed financial adjuster  
explaining his duties  he says   people make promises and break them  
i help them remember   
he has a chiseled body full of tattoos  
he has the weathered look indicative of a man who has seen his share of hard times  
he speaks in a hushed but menacing tone of voice  
in other words  this is sylvester stallone acting like    sylvester 
stallone  
and like most of his previous roles  his character is a shallow  onedimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk tough  hassle a few hapless people  find out what he needs to know  and then dispense his own kind of justice  
with the charisma of a pit bull  being tough is all that jack carter knows  
yet  even tough guys know when to put family first  
as the story begins  we learn that jacks little brother has died in a car accident  
the police attribute it to heavy drinking  
however  jack is suspicious  believing that he was taken out  
he takes a break from his vegas duties and tries to see if he can find the truth  
as he pokes around  he runs into several lowlife characters  
they include a shady business partner  a prostitute  a dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates  and an oily owner of a porn website  
any one of them may know something about his brothers death  
all of them have the means of carrying out the deed  
but dont expect an exercise in sleuthing where wellplaced clues lead carter to the truth  
hes all brawn and no brains  so there are no epiphanies during his investigation  
instead  he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward  cycling through this circle of suspects  
flustered with his lack of progress  he cycles through them again and again  
this all gets tiring fairly quickly  
by the time the film launches into its final act  were numb from its pedestrian pace  
oddly  as a toughguy thriller  it starves us for action  
admittedly  there is one nifty chase sequence  but this is related to a tangential and needless plot  carters vegas ties send thugs to retrieve him   
the story also fails to generate any kind of emotion  
stallone has the personality of a slab of stone  
and the look and feel of the film is perpetually downcast  
the weather is constantly overcast or rainy  
meanwhile  most shots take place at night  in dimly lit rooms  or in dark alleys  
its just impossible to get stirred about that kind of atmosphere  
as a result   get carter  amounts to nothing more than a flat thriller  bereft of clever moments and devoid of any excitement  
youre better off leaving this guy alone

0	"plot  a rich psychiatrist with a great home life gets his cute daughter kidnapped by some bad guys who want him to extract some information from the mind of one of his nutty patients  
of course  the patient is not cooperative and the doctor only has a few hours to comply with their demands  before they kill his daughter  
pretty good premise  no  
critique  if youre not a fan of movies packed with plot holes  inconsistencies and yes  even more plot holes  heed my words and skip this hollow thriller  
and i dont like saying that either  since this film actually had some potential and started off pretty well  
sure  the story is basically just an amalgamation of ransom  primal fear and nick of time pureed into one  but the whole  psychiatrist working against the clock  thing  actually had me engaged at first  
but its at about the halfway mark of this movie  that the bottom drops out and all that were left with are a lot of questions and very few plausible answers  
we get the overly smart kid who manages to  pull one  over on the bad guys  
we get a weak woman with her leg in a cast beating the crap out of a tough bad guy  
we get douglas character  a new york uppedity psychiatrist  suddenly turning into an action hero  with moves and attitude to boot  
and what about the films main plot point  
why would the bad guys still give a crap about this thing after 10 years  and even more so  why would they only give the shrink until the days end to do his part  
  you waited 10 years  whats another few days   or why not set up another heist instead    
ill tell you why  its because we wouldnt have a  bad  movie otherwise  thats why  
and many  many more  
ugh  whatever the case  it was just about the time that douglas character suddenly removed murphys character from the mental home  and how come she went with him so nicely  
i thought she didnt trust him   that i turned to my buddy and asked when the movie had turned into a joke  
and a few bogus chase and action sequences later  we were left with a longwinded ending that did little to answer any other questions i mightve still had  and actually brought up even more contradictions  
badly put together  this movie features some decent acting  some nice cinematography and an initially interesting premise  but loses it all in a haze of plot miscues which ultimately leave you with little care for anyone  
in fact  if it wasnt for brittany murphys excellent portrayal of a traumatized teen  jennifer espositos embarrassing performance as a police woman  yeah  right  
watching her delivering lines was the funniest part of this flick but it wasnt supposed to be  and michael douglas cool  regular guy  part  there would be little reason to remain seated until the end of this picture  
incidentally  can anyone please give me one good reason why espositos character was in this movie in the first place  
she was completely superfluous  
and on top of all that  by the end of this flick  the director seems to have realized how dumb the audience must be to have bought most of the garbage that hed been shoveling out for the hour and a half prior  and decides to add insult to injury by flashing back to an earlier characters death when one of the bad guys dies  just so we know  as an audience   that the two are interrelated somehow  
ooooh  thanks  mr  fleder    i 
appreciate the spoonfeeding  dude    yum  
yum    but 
how about explaining every other plot point in your film that made no sense  
whatever  
either way  i dont give a rats ass because this movie is a dog and thats unfortunate because it actually did have some good points going for it  
see it if you like dumb thrillers  
incidentally  if you appreciated along came a spider  you will likely enjoy this film as well  
they both start off with interesting premises  only to toss all logic and sense out the window about halfway through  
wheres joblo coming from

1	"rated  r for strong language  sexual dialogue  drug use  crude humor  violence and brief nudity  
starring  ben affleck  matt damon  linda fiorentino  salma hayek  alan rickman  chris rock  kevin smith  jason mewes  jason lee  george carlin  alanis morissette  
running time  130 minutes 
being a huge fan of kevin smith  i was expecting a lot out of his newest project dogma  
it might just be kevins best work to date  
its very funny with smart and foulmouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has a serious undertone to it and besides going against god and jesus christ  it actually tries to tell people that there is such a thing rather than that there isnt  
in 1994 a little 27  000 movie premiered at sundance  
this little film was called clerks and this little film went on to become a huge video sensation  
you really cant meet a person on this green earth who has not seen clerks  
it was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year and soon a sequel is coming  
in 1995 kevin made another movie mallrats that flopped horribly  thought it was not the best movie ever made it was a pretty good little flick  
it was panned by critics but hailed by audiences and in 1997 chasing amy came out and was kevins biggest success to date  
now in 1999 we get a great little movie by the name of dogma  
wow  what a cast  
ok here is the plot in this movie  linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic  
one day at her house metatron  the voice of god  appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels  matt damon and ben affleck  from getting back into heaven by ways of a church  
ok now get this  she is told to find two prophets  one who talks a lot and one who doesnt  however she gets jay and silent bob instead  who give us great performances   
now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky  chris rock  and helps guide her to find these angels  
salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way  
azrael  jason lee  who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win  
bethany  linda fiorentino  has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith  
what a movie  it is everything rolled into one  an offensive  offbeat  smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end  and ends up being a feelgood movie  
who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself  
now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart  
yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot  but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven  it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god  
this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie  
kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie  
of course the best  and funniest  of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob  
probably the best characters in movies that i like  
the starstudded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin  jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while  
the script was written by kevin smith with many fwords in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isnt and makes us laugh at the same time as we think  
chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well  with some classic lines  
linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is  
of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay  as well as silent bob   
alan rickman  jason lee  salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles  
being oscar winners for the classic good will hunting they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could  
ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story  
the movies only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it  
however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members  dogma stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to clerks  
while being funny at times  in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but cant deny it  
dogma will offend people  especially deeply religious people  but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you  
all kevin smith fans must see

same old attitude  
dont forget to recommend a film  read the journal  or send me some of that nasty hate mail   
starring bruce willis  billy bob thornton  liv tyler  ben affleck written by jonathan hensleigh and j  j  
abrams directed by michael bay 
it rocksactually  lots of rocks fly at us or from us  in slow or fast motion  at several points in the film  
they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward  and when they landonce in a while  when we need a break from the space sequencesthey cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like  
  nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur   
they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon  a steroid users answer to deep impact  
bruce willis stars as harry stamper  a famed oildriller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond  zero barrier  and destroys our planet  
why an oil driller  
they require someone experienced with deepcore mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid  
  in one unintentionally    
hilarious sequence  nasa asks harry to inspect a deepcore driller they built based on his own blueprints  it is poorly constructedharry criticizes almost every aspect of it  
we trust nasa to build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids   
harry assembles the obligatory  ragtag  bunch of  cowboys   including a blond guy  a fat guy  a black guy  a wiseass  and the man who is sleeping with his daughter  affleck   
once they reach space  we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrongperhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it  i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes  
whether or not they save the day  i will not reveal  
nor will you care  
i will say this  you know youre in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope  
willis has barely a chance to come alive  ditto for affleck  
their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act  in a last minuteand futileattempt to inject warmth into the material  
steve buscemis characterthe wiseassis exceptionally problematic  
  rockhound   as hes called  is sarcastic and foolish  so they tape him to a chair  where he spends most of the film  
so why did they bring him up there to begin with  
rather  why write him into the film  give 
his almostwitty oneliners to serious willis  who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies  at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter  firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig  
im guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel  at least in my world where the sky is blue  
liv tyler is pretty and humourless  as always  suspiciously  four of her fathers bands   aerosmith   songs grace the soundtrack  
director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick  like ketchup  eventually drowning the movie onscreen  
  the middle hour is a nonsensical  pyrotechnic assault on the average primates brain   
whenever someone dies in this movie  a crew member inevitably yells out  we lost  insert dead persons last name here    
i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oilguycumastronaut from a live one  and closeups of the corpses faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance  as their skin was often covered in fake blood  
armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla  
it looks nicer  and has fewer plotholes within its equally ludicrous framework  
it has a vivid soundmix  
but at almost twoandahalf hours  i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story  
the love story has been played up in the ads  perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanicfever  
bollocks  
the lovers in the film are miles apart throughouterase all thoughts of nude sketching or carsex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a mooncrawler  
remember a little film called jaws  
in this film  three independentminded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark  
they didnt much like each other at first  eventually  they started to respect one another  
one of jaws great scenes involved the wouldbeahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories  
this is the sort of malebonding foreign to bay or his producer  jerry bruckheimer  who throw too many characters into the mix and expect well care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end  
not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintancesid be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before  action  was called  
a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who dont bare their souls  who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chestbeating bravery  
to this  i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic  nor brave  nor smart  even  this team couldnt build a birdhouse  
and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailera trailer for a movie written by a team of bodybuilders and greeting card authorsive never been a prouder wimp my whole life

1	"the central focus of michael winterbottoms  welcome to sarajevo  is sarajevo itself  the city under siege  and its different effect on the characters unfortunate enough to be stuck there  
it proves the backdrop for a stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents   platoon    racial tumultuosness  the risible  the walking dead   or a tinge of schmaltziness   schindlers list    
the two leads  stephen dillane as a reporter and emira nusevic as an orphan with a plight few can identify with  are extremely believable  not one moment with them involved rings false  
the question is not what went right  
the question is what went wrong  
for one  the film fails to provide a political overview of the war as it progresses  the dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs  and thats about it    
the assortment of highprofile supporting actors  ranging from woody harrelson as a yankee reporter  into  liquor and cigarrettes to marisa tomei as a huggable childrens aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness of their characters  albeit they strive  
the interrupted use of authentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest of the film  it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison  
still  winterbottom eschews mawkishness through flashy  frantic editing and imaginative use of music  
and its a plus  because he doesnt toy with our emotions with sentimental blandness  
he wants us to know that in war  no one is victorious  
the sweet hereafter 
starring ian holm  sarah polley  bruce greenwood  tom mccamus  gabrielle rose  arsinee khanjian  alberta watson  maury chaykin  caerthan banks  
produced by atom egoyan and camelia frieberg  
script by atom egoyan  based on the novel by russell banks   
directed by atom egoyan  
running time  110 mins  
rated r   
atom egoyans powerfully meditative  the sweet hereafter  is as anything as haunting and transcendental as ive seen this year  
it not only explores the aftermaths of a terrible tragedy with magnificent subtlety  with cold  and stunning shots of the backdrop of this mistfortune but also by telegraphing the sense of devastation that has permeated the small town with an enormous amount of dignity and respect for each and every soul affected  
ian holm as the somber  lonely lawyer seeking compensation for the townspeople  has a decency and a restraint uncommon with lawyers  hes a lion for the wrong reasons  the pain for having lost his daughter  shes a druggie who frequently calls him begging for money  is reflected on the town  
and in some mesmerizing flashbacks  we witness how she lost her purity  
its one of the most strikingly breathtaking takes on the loss of innocence ive ever seen  
but the most astounding part goes to sarah polly  the peaceful  benevolent girl who  in contrast to the other characters  remains the most mentally stable during past  present or future  
her ability to convey concealed pain and unconditional love is the opposite  yet nearrevolutionary role that won emily watson an oscar nomination for  breaking the waves   
both women are torn apart by an extraordinary incident but it is only then that we truly see  truly feel  their wordless  omnipotent love  
  the sweet hereafter  though  is atom egoyans movie and as of now  he is emerging as the definite face of independent cinema  
after surging to worldwide recognition with 1994s  exotica    the sweet hereafter  makes him something few people in this industry can call themselves  an artist  
he interweaves time with a delicacy and sees a soul with a purity that is just not common

0	"making your first feature film aint easy  
assemble a decent  if not  strong cast  as writerdirector robert moresco has done with one eyed king  and youre already ahead of the game  
but rehash old plot lines  tired dialogue  and standard clich  s  and a wellintentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film  
how many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse  
the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making yet another  but here we have it  
again  
five irish kids in nycs hells kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop  
with teary music  
and slow motion  
in the films first scene  
the kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults  unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen  
leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a goodhearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante  
id like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah  blah  blah  but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points  
hes concerned about buddy jason gedricks heroin abuse  
he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwins characters sister  
he looks into who might be pushing the most moroniclooking counterfeit cash ever made  a genuinely funny touch   
but none of this ever really amounts to anything  
it seems that morescos greater concern is to provide that intangible  slice of life   that flavor of the neighborhood that everyones been trying to evoke since scorseses early work  
so  we get the drunk guys  hugging and singing together at the local bar  to prove to us that they really love each other  
  do people actually do this    
we get a lot of tough street talk  usually mumbled for effect  and a whole lot of the fword  whether it sounds like it fits or not  
we also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose  
bruno kirby  chazz palminteri  you know  guys youve seen in movies just like this one before  
assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears  and baldwins performance is adequate  but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that its almost funny  
moresco  a theater guy and sometimes tv writer  including the series falcone   obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child  but the content is probably too personal  
as a result  the movies style is heavyhanded  in need of a considerable amount of toning down  
nearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids  moresco reminds us  boy does he remind us  
with slow dissolves to the earlier scene  running in slow motion  complete with dialogue from the present  just in case we dont comprehend the link to the past  
moresco needs to either trust his audiences intelligence  or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it  
his next project should have a little more personal distance  and a lot more subtlety  
if he actually gets that chance  
reviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage  feature story coming soon

1	"mary nortons childrens book series  the borrowers  has been made into several belowaverage television movies  
so  i wasnt too enthused as i entered the theater for the bigscreen debut of the minute clan  
but i was in for a shock  the borrowers is actually a thoroughly delightful movie with plenty of good laughs and even some decent special effects  
the lender family is being thrown out of their longtime home  
their aunt  who owned the property  never left a will  
now  an unscrupulous lawyer  ocious potter  john goodman  plans to demolish the house and replace it with an ultramodern housing development  
but the lenders are not alone in their house  
living under the floorboards is a family of borrowers  4 inch tall people who make their living as scavengers from the human  beans  above  
the clock family of borrowers is as distressed as the lenders  especially once they discover the evil potter actually has a copy of the will which leaves the home to the lenders  
so it is up to the clocks  pod  jim broadbent  and homily  celia imrie   along with their kids  arrietty  flora newbigin  and peagreen  tom felton   to recover the will and save the household  
but when potter learns of the tiny people  he enlists the skills of exterminator jeff  mark williams  to kill off the clan  
theres plenty of attention to detail in the borrowers  especially in the furnishings of the clock family house  made out of lost board game parts and credit cards  
the background details are nearly as rich as the entertaining story  
the various predicaments of the clock family are clever and thrilling  
based on an original story  the screenwriters did a good job at imagining all the potential and unusual perils that could exist for a 4inch tall person  
as the villain  john goodmans performance veers on the edge of being overthetop  
but his performance suits the role well  and he does very well in the films many slapstick moments  
with a nearly seamless mix of oversized sets  bluescreen shots and cgi  the special effects in the borrowers are very well done  
there are a few times when you can spot the effects at work  but none of them are so jarring that you lose the suspension of disbelief  
hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of being labeled a childrenonly movie  for it is surprisingly entertaining and fun to watch

1	"what surprises me most about the longawaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker  
the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis  
i can hear batfans everywhere protesting   first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman  and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker    
and  indeed  this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play  
nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding  oscarworthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman  
nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown  romero played the joker in the 60s tv series   
on one hand  nicholsons joker is extremely funny  
his murderous escapades and manic outbursts  which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts  bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film  
but on the other hand  his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind  
the jokers cruelty and demented  diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister  
this guy is off his rocker  and he not only knows it  he flaunts it  
but enough about nicholson as the joker  im sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman  
like many  i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader  
but batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting  
keaton delivers  
he is convincing as the tormented millionaire  bruce wayne  and beneath his hard  black body armor  he is mysterious and formidable as the batman  
even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character  keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city  
visually  batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team  
the movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak  gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as  the dark knight returns  and  the killing joke   
burtons film is a feast for the eyes  the 35 million budget is definitely on the screen  
the sets  costumes  and makeup are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations  
nicholson isnt joking when he boasts   wait till they get a load of me   
his grimacing smile  green hair  and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous  
keatons wardrobe is equally appropriate  
batmans cape  mask  and body armor make him look threatening  frightening  and invincible bringing to mind not adam wests campy costume in the tv series but peter weirs outfit in robocop  
production designer anton fursts sets are a wonder  
gotham city is dark and foreboding  almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york  
the batcave is cold  bare  and desolate  
the world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption  
the movies gritty bladerunnerrobocop look is a joy to behold  
the plot  on the other hand  is not as rousing  
the screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting  
it takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear  
batman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology  but it fails to give us enough of either one  
as i mentioned earlier  the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker  but it never fully establishes batmans psychological motives and underpinnings  
in terms of action  batman is not as thrilling as you might expect  
burton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story  
more than anything  batman is a mood film  
while batman may not completely absorb and excite you  it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books  
thanks to its distinctive look  the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world

0	"a film that means well  but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama  
its jeroen krabb  s melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who cant forget their bitter past  
the heroine is an attractive  carefree  nonreligious 20yearold  chaja  fraser   who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations  screwing a student rebel leader  and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother  s  gebrecht  and her selfabsorbed  eccentric father  schell   
her parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps  and her home life is filled with angst  
her mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything  while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos  a family album  silverware  and his old violin  
he buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis  but cant locate them now due to all the changes in the city  
out of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment  she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents apartment building  mr  apfelschnitt  topol   tells her about  
the hasidics are ultraorthodox  they dont go to the cinema or watch tv  adhere to strict dress codes  and strictly observe their religious laws  
chaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules  but soon finds the wife  mrs  kalman  rossellini   to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children  a 4yearold named simcha  monty  who doesnt talk  
the stern mr  kalman  krabb   is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses  
to hammer home the point of how antisemitism hasnt gone away theres a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge  bradley   who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator  
the film is done in by its hamfisted script as the story  adapted from carl friedmans book  the shovel and the loom   goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality  
it starts off telling chajas story of how shes a lost jewess trying to find her identity  then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment  and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that cant be forgotten  
the effort seemed heavyhanded  as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters  
the supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring  chajas parents are given no human shades  while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was onedimensional and falsely acted  
the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser  whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt  but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots  while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence  but is strong in accepting her faith  
topols reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser  acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense  
the film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it cant love  it starts out by showing how under chajas loving care hes taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away  beginning by saying quack  quack and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder  
but by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence  refuses to speak because of his stern dad  and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident  the film thereby exploits the boys sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done  
i felt i didnt just see a movie  but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story  
it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon  as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarilythe message it keeps sending was already received  
in the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage  one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past  
that seems strange  since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about  
unless i was mistaken and the films real aim was to make us cry over simcha

1	"there is a striking scene early in  city of angels   where all the angels who live unseen in our midst  gather at the beach to watch the sun rise  
the camera moves above them  showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women  all garbed in black  
then the camera moves in on the face of seth  an angel played by nicolas cage  and as the sun rises  he smiles and his entire face lights up  
you see  the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets  but they cannot feel a human touch  
it is an important scene for several reasons  
first of all  it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible  
the film presents these fantastic beings as normallooking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth  watching what goes on with little interference  
there are none of the standard  hokey angel references used in recent films like  angels in the outfield   1994  or  michael   1996   
the angels here are stark and believable  
this early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition  for its shows how gods angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot  and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures  like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs  or the smell of the salt in the air  
there is an inherent tragedy in being an angel  although there is much beauty in it as well  
they eternally walk the earth  listening to our thoughts  touching us in our pain  and leading the dying to heaven  
like human existence  being an angel is often confused and unsure  
  city of angels  is essentially a love story  between seth and a human  a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie  meg ryan   
he first sees her when he is in her operating room  waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven  
maggie is distraught  doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table  and seth is moved by her efforts and  more importantly  her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies  
angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain  and seth does what he can with his invisible touch  but its not enough  
he wants to be with her and share her pain  not just stand back at a distance  
he learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to  fall  and become human  
he learns this from another fallen angel  played by dennis franz   n  y  p  d  
blue   in a touching and humorous performance  
sitting at a diner together  franz tells cages character about how wonderful it is to be human  to be able to taste food  feel another persons skin  smell the air  and most importantly  have a loving wife and children  
of course  there is pain to go along with all this  but for seth  it will be worth it  
  city of angels  is something of a reinterpretation of wim wenders haunting 1988 film  wings of desire   
wenders film was more like a poem  it was the feeling  the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened  
the americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles  and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human  
and  unlike most foreign films that are remade into hollywood fare  it doesnt suffer extensive damage  
this may be because director brad silberling   casper   and screenwriter dana stevens   blink   wanted to make  city of angels  its own movie  inspired by  wings of desire   but not an attempt to copy it  
and yet   city of angels  is not a typical hollywood movie  
it is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale   the english patient    whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world  
seale creates many striking visuals  in addition to the beach scene  there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around  looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by  
while the film travels along a charted plot  it takes time to develop its characters and situations  it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly  and shows just how thin those boundaries are  
both cage and ryan give soulful  softspoken performances  
ryan  who is usually so bouncy and energetic  truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch  
cage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple  heartfelt gazes  and speaks with the comforting  knowing voice that only an angel could have  
what is most striking about  city of angels  is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay  which is both unexpected and challenging  
its not a formulaic hollywood ending  because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time  
it doesnt give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance  
instead  it offers something much better  something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive

1	"of circumcision  psychic wounds and the family sitcom 
the opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film  
theres a guys voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like  and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women  
as his imagination plays o n  he  and we  picture these motley characters in a mixandmatch shuffle of unlikely marriages  businesswomen with bums  matrons with paint salesmen  the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy  
its not just a witty  funny summing up of the film s themes  you might not guess it yet  but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on  
what starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction  gets taken on a road trip  put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash  
that may not sound so different from the average family sitcom  and the general idea of the film doesnt  at first  seem so wildly distant from standardissue hollywood comedy  man who was adopted as a child  ben still er  sets out on a journey to meet his real parents  along with his wife  patricia arquette   his baby  and a pretty psychologyresearcher  tea leoni  in tow  
various mixups  shenanigans  oddball characters and  yup  disasters follow  
but if you think youve been here before  the dialogue and the direction  by david o  russell  who made spanking the monkey  take it into another dimension  
the dreaded tname seems an inevitable reference point  what with a drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance  but really the point is that the footmassage master hasnt got a monopoly on plot twists and fast  funny  irreverent lines  or on the absurdities of ordinary speech  
whether its about circumcision  psychic wounds  oral sex  carjacking  the beauties of the armpit area  or ronald reagan  the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention  
the best thing is how these words arent just there for the punchlines  but are great precisely because theyre said in character  like tea leonis neuroticallycharged psychobabbler whos able to say under assault   its understandable if you find this threatening   
the cast is excellent throughout  and  rather than singling out anybody  kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting  with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission  
there are some elements of a woody allen film in this  not to mention the handheld camera and loose  improvisational feel of some scenes   
like allen  russells interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children  and everybody  really   
still  if youre expecting a privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring a la  murphy brown    frasier   fillintheblankamericancomedy  well  it wont happen  
the film sets up expectations like these  with the lead characters search f or his origins and his hopes of selfhealing  only to knock them down  
if the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey oneness  flirting with disasters charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go  
and that  the film suggests  is the essential family state  and you better learn to love it  
somehow  this is perversely feelgood cinema  right up to its manic end

0	"  payback   brian helgelands inauspicious directing debut  coincidentally  he previously penned the awardwinning screenplay for 1997s  l  a  confidential    is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one ideaa movie with nonstop violence  death  and villainsand runs with it  or should i say  barely manages to crawl away with it  
mel gibson  in yet another disappointing picture   conspiracy theory  and  lethal weapon 4   anyone    stars as the reprehensible villainhero  porter  a man who becomes determined to get his 50 share of 140  000  which he stole in a robbery  back when his partnerincrime  gregg henry  and drugaddicted wife  deborah kara unger  doublecross him  shoot him  and leave him for dead  
porter is not dead  howevernot by a long shotas he quickly rehabilitates and  along with his loyal prositute girlfriend  rosie  maria bello   sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay  
the tagline for  payback  is   get ready to root for the bad guy   and sure enough  this is true  as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way  
i wouldnt have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest  but it wasnt  and therefore  i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever  
no attempt is made to flesh the roles into threedimensional characters  and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them  
just because the protagonist  a  bad guy   is played by mel gibson doesnt mean i will  root for him   and i didnt  
quite the contrary  every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death  although some of them did  anyway  just to spice up the dull proceedings   
since none of the respectable actors in  payback  actually have human beings to play  only one performance managed to stand out  
lucy alexis liu  of t  v  s  ally mcbeal    who plays a spicy sm dominatrix  brightens up every scene she is in  and has a definite flair for comedy  something i would have liked to have seen more of  since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat  
meanwhile  gibson  who is perfectly fine here  sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging  
unger  who made an impression in 1997s  the game   is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in  and only has two purproses   1  to get high on heroin  and  2  because she plays a key part in an early flashback  
finally  kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax  and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb  tellingly  he didnt appear in the original cut of the film  but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later   
like most action movies  the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking  
in the course of the 102minute running time of  payback   porter is shot three times in the back  hit by a van  beaten up  and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer  
and guess what  
not only does he survive the whole ordeal  but he is happygolucky in the penultimate sequence  and can still walk    
even though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag  
  payback  is not  in any way  an entertaining film  even though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on  but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is a blank screen  
perhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this  so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements  like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours

whyd it have to be snakes  
color of night is the worst movie of the year  
period  
forget north  clifford  or  heaven help us  even on deadly ground  
here is a movie misfire so audaciously awful that you cant help but wonder how the actors all kept straight faces while filming  
for starters  the  group  is a collection of mixed nuts better suited to bob newhart than bruce willis  
these are realistic portrayals of the mentally unhealthy  
playing a prissy obsessivecompulsive  cuckoos nest alumni brad dourif  alone  may set the psychology profession back ten years  
the plots a wreck with laughable dialogue  pointless pov shifts  and the one big secret solvable in the first fifteen minutes  
director richard rush  who once helmed freebie and the bean  doesnt seem to mind  
unfazed by the nincompoop plot and cuckoo characterizations  he overfills the film with enough canny camera shots and zany setpieces to make the effort almost worth watching  
his token freeway chase is ok  but the director has more fun with a vertiginous ending ala  most recently  fatal analysis  
acting credits are acrosstheboard awful  
willis can be forgiven because hes filming die hard 3 as we speak  
but what about ruben blades insulting presence as the cop  
or lesley ann warrens stereotypical sex addict  
or worst offender jane march as a mysterygirlwhosnorealmystery  
shudder  
bottom line  how they all kept straight faces  ill never know

0	"poster boy for codependency needs patching 
patch adams a film review by michael redman copyright 1999 by michael redman 
mediocrity is a pox on civilization  
in our heavily consumer oriented society  there is an enormous demand to churn out  stuff   
what would happen to our economy if we didnt feel the need to have more things  
to make us buy more  businesses need to produce a ton of product  
the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality  
the film industry is like any other  
in order for studios to survive  they have to make money  
the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit  
some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that  less talented people are used  
there arent enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary  
for some reason  its never crossed anyones mind that the real equation is quality films  more profit  
often  mediocre films are more of a pain for the audience than the horrendous ones  
at you can have a good time making fun of bad movies  
im not suggesting that  patch adams  was tossed out just to rake in the bucks  
my guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel  
it features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story  but its as dull as could be  
hunter  patch  adams  robin williams  desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis  
checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt  he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around  
patch could be a poster boy for codependency  
he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesnt focus on his own problems  
he decides that he wants to be a physician  leaves the place and a couple of years later enrolls in the medical college of virginia  
as a med student  patchs antics at the schools hospital catch the attention of his soon to be archenemy  straightlaced dean walcott  bob gunton   
the dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although hes one of the top students  
he writes in patchs academic file that he shows  excessive happiness   
i walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing  
there also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies  
then it struck me  
it must be based on a true story  
the movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute  a free clinic  
robin williams is an amazing actor  
while he is adept at dramatic roles  his forte is overthetop free spirits  
thats what makes his failure here so remarkable  
patch is exactly the character he should be best at  yet even the scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat  
something holds him back  
most of the rest of the cast is twodimensional  
for a film that champions seeing patients as human beings  its curious that the ones here are cardboard characters  
peter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person  
unfortunately hes in the film for only about two minutes  
the audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene  
were not left to our own emotional decisions  were hit over the head with them  
shavedheaded children with cancer  an elderly woman whom patch makes laugh  a beautiful woman who cant love because of her abusive history  
when a group of students fix up an old house to use as a clinic in the andy hardy  hey  lets put on a play  
we can use the barn and my mom can make the curtains   
mode  they laugh and roll around while painting each other  
there might as well be giant signs flashing   feel good now   
  feel bad now   
  patch  is a good title for the film  
it is a patchwork of every manipulative scene you can think of  
the fulloflife student fights stodgy establishment types  
theres a touching death  
then theres another  
the film doesnt trust us to get it the first time  
the dean tries to kick patch out and later he tries again  
worst of all is the final courtroom bit  
scarylooking old men sit in judgment of a man who only wants to help people  
the room is packed with patchs supporters  
williams makes a supposedly impassioned speech about the humanity of all  
it has as much emotion as his earlier statement  humans are the only animal that kills members of its own species  contains truth  
most of the blame must be placed with the director tom shadyac and screenwriter steve oedekerk  
shadyac also directed the first  ace ventura  movie  
oedekerk directed the second one  
need i say more  
the real adams is to be admired for his devotion to treating patients as people rather than diseases  
the film has a number of worthy messages about the state of the modern medical business with hmos and managed care  
the  doctors are not gods  theme will resonate with a number of people  but its so poorly produced that no one will care

1	"do film critics have morals  
are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow  
naturally we dont want to go into a film with any preconceived notions  which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish  
secondly  and along the same line  we cant prejudge a film because of its stars  director  etc  the difference  
well  in the first one  wed go into a film thinking its going to be dumb or its going to be good  and that would affect our viewing  that movie sounds and looks dumb  so im not expecting much   
on the second hand  were simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal  grudge  against the film company  its made by disney  
oh  its just a merchandising ploy then   the actors  jim carreys in it  
its gonna stink    or the director  who  
cant be that good   
this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint  
make sense  
ok  but what about comparing  
isnt that kind of along the same lines  
when we compare a certain actor or director or even composers credibility in one film to another they were involved in  is that really fair  
sure  in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more  but what about jackie brown  for example  
is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction  just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both  
i think it is  and ill tell you why  
a good critic should be able to view the film from the  average joe  or jane   viewpoint  while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film  
sometimes that can be tough  
  the acting was superb  but i was bored  or  i loved it   
it was sooooo cheezy   
might be used to describe a film  
these are contradictions  and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique  
but which is more important  
and which is better  
an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring  or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again  
getting back to the point  my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because were reflecting what the public wants to know anyway  
every average person out there whos interested in this film is likely to ask  how does it compare to pulp fiction   
and so  as a critic  im already responsible to ask that same question  
jackie brown stars pam grier  the  blaxploitation  heroine from the 1970s  who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character  
tarantinos pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travoltas sudden revival in the movie industry  and with talks of an oscar nomination  the same is likely to happen for grier  
  weve made it thru comparison 1   jackie is a 44yearold airline stewardess who brings in extra cash  and probably her main revenue  by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie  pulp fictions samuel l  jackson and comparison 2   
ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara  robert de niro   a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years  to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half million dollars  
trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet  michael keaton  and taken into custody for possession of narcotics  as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed  
naturally this proves an obstacle to ordells plans and  not as friendly intended as wed hope  he posts jackies bail after she is put behind bars  
the thing is  ordell is in this for no one more than himself  and as we learn from his previous actions  hes willing to kill anyone who stands in the way  
jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze  
ordell wont think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as shes always done  yet at the same time  a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided  
it comes down to a simple question  would jackie rather face ordell or prison  
what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help  the law  ordell  or maybe just herself  
coming into play is another 70s veteran  robert forster as jackies bail bondsmen max cherry  
maxs obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system  and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance  
also involved is ordells  surfer girl  girlfriend melanie  bridget fonda   a ditzy sun bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand  
fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role  but theres nothing more to her  and therefore  she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters  
de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself  
de niro is a brilliant actor  but a character who hardly ever speaks doesnt need a de niro to play him  
compared to pulp fiction  comparison 3   the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable  
in pulp fiction  even the small  seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful  complete  and lifelike  whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldnt have suffered much with a lesser talented cast  the exception being grier  
tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind  so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth  
sadly  grier too could have received a bit more attention  especially when the story is all about her newlyjarred perception of life  
jackson teams up with tarantino again  but the chemical reaction isnt as awesome as the first time  
jules was the rambling  biblequoting hitman in pulp fiction  and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off  
and although jackson is really  really good in jackie brown  i dont think hes quite as irreplaceable  
in fact  maybe a new face would have been better  
jackson couldve remained tarantinos jules  and a new guy could have become ordell  forever to remain so in our memories  
sadly  these characters are too much the same  except ordell just isnt as impressive  and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules  
another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning  
this is griers film  so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses  
it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted  but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story  
it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantinos quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style  and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonards novel  rum punch   
for those moviegoers  dont expect another pulp fiction and youll be satisfied  for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90s film making  
the directing has toned down a bit  however  yet were still reminded that this is tarantinos movie thanks to odd splitscreen storytelling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints  
so getting back to the question that i began with  this isnt pulp fiction at all  
its good  but it isnt anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place  
this is a more conservative tarantino  but not one that wont satiate true fans  
if you can realize that this isnt going to knock your socks off  then youll be happy to at least let it massage your feet  
after all  we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy

0	"its actually not so bad that dreamworks decided to release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode i  the phantom menace  because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy  
and no  i really dont feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the boxoffice  
really  i dont  
not at all  
the plot has been done before  a mysterious  unaddressed love letter shows up in a small town  causing confusion for everyone who reads it  
the center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen  kate capshaw  and by the way  what is it with bookstore owner main characters  
in the past year and a half weve seen them in life is beautiful  youve got mail  this movie  and the upcoming notting hill   who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore  
she immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from  and comes to the  incorrect  conclusion that the author of the note is a young employee played by tom everett scott  
he  reading the letter himself  assumes that she wrote it for him  
after a while  they fall in love  well  duh   
kate feels guilty about getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her  and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman  tom selleck   
to add to her turmoil  her mother shows up  blythe danner  who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about 9  and her trusted bookstore manager  deadpan ellen degeneres  quits  
supporting characters arent called supporting for nothing  
their purpose isnt just to move the plot along  theyre also supposed to give the storyline a backbone  
to do this  they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting  
rarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed  dull  cardboard secondary characters  especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonists various interactions with them  
this is the love letters damning error  
capshaws character is as good as i have seen present in recent romantic comedies  but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely onedimensional  
because of that  the love letter is awkward and insincere  
even worse  its a bore  
i liked capshaw and her helen  but everyone else is painfully fake  undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist  
there is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either  and besides degeneres wisecracks  theres little that is even a little amusing  
this is not a completely thoughtless film and director peter hosun chan does a good job of portraying helens yearnings and various subtle complexities  
but its far from profound  
there isnt a common theme running through the proceedings  thus the movie seems thoughtfully pointless  
really  this is a harmless little movie  its far from an abomination and its not torturous to sit through  
but bad  it is  
awful  it also is  
the love letter is a failure  and an inane failure at that

1	"billy bob thornton  who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996s sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer  is becoming one of the most versatile  and most accomplished  american actors around at the moment  
as jacob  the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxtons hank  thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers  
three men  hank  paxton   jacob  thornton  and their friend lou  brent briscoe  stumble upon a plane wreck which  upon closer inspection  yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money  
jacob and lou want to pocket the cash  
hank  the smarter  and perhaps more naive  of the three  insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find  
eventually  they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found  and then split the money three ways  
things start going wrong  though  with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan  
disaster is sure to strike  
director sam raimi  of the evil dead and darkman fame  has made an excellent and thoughtprovoking film  worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name  
while there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work  raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come  
scott b  smiths screenplay  based on his novel  which i havent read  is a fine example of escalating tension  
while it does remind one of danny boyles shallow grave without the abundance of black humour  it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality  or the lack thereof  found in a film with this subject matter  
alar kivilos cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coens fargo  with the bleak  snowy landscape almost becoming another character  
danny elfman also does well with his moody  finelywritten score  
if theres a flaw in the film  its that it goes on for just a little too long  
just when we think that they are about to wrap things up  raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further  
while this isnt really a bad thing  it did become a little frustrating at times  this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand   
the performances are excellent  with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scenestealing turn as hanks scheming wife  
this is an excellent showcase for thorntons fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi  who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films  
fingers crossed  though  that this doesnt stop him from making another evil dead sequel  
"
1	"in arguably the most anticipated movie this century  george lucas has achieved a very mixed reaction to a sure blockbuster  
despite the fact the script and plot is a bit of a let down  the entire movie on the whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence  in the sound and special effects department  
in terms of characters  by far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala  natalie portman   whose mature performance far exceeds her tender 14 years of age  
she is one  hot babe who defines true  woman leadership  
she not only has a presence  but knows how to take command of the situation and save her planet from ruination  
no thanks to the jedi knights who although led by the force  lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking up a plan to do anything  
the young obiwan kenobi  ewan mcgregor  who has a bad hair day in every scene  gets to kill a bad guy in the end  but lacks a love interest to make him a desirable sort of hero  
in fact all the jedi knight are a bit asexual  there must be something about the force which makes them all hermits and loners  
i mean it would be interesting to see yodas girlfriend for a change  if he has one  
not much better is quigon jinn  liam neeson  who mostly broods  and has a better hair do than obiwan  but only to find the young anakin skywalker and make the biggest mistake of his life  
also fascinating is george lucas  metoclorian theory  which claims that microorganisms live within our cells and tie us to the fabric of the universe  
and it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an individual which make them particularly powerful in the force  
more humerous are the claims to the immaculate conception of darth vader  no doubt a concept stolen from the christian faith  except there will be no christmas to celebrate the birth of this dark emissary of the force  
overall an experience which is not to be missed because of the very fact that its predecessor almost command a viewing of this inferior successor  
by all means not the pinnacle of the star wars phenomena but an adequate addition to the clan  
watch out for the next one  it should be one steamy encounter between queen amidala and anakin skywalker  who i believe should be portrayed by  leonardo di caprio  
"
1	"in 1995  brian singer and christopher mcquarrie dreamed up a simple concept  the audience isnt stupid  
from that  they went on and created the most plotdriven  intricately pieced movie in the last 25 years  
the result  the usual suspects  one hell of a movie that redefines the word plot twist  
the story is convoluted  and is really confusing to read  although easy to follow on screen  
special investigator kujan  chazz palminteri  grills  verbal  kint  kevin spacey   a crippled conman who is the lone survivor of an la boat explosion that claimed more than 20 victims  
kujan wants to confirm that his nemesis  the rogue cop keaton  gabriel byrne   is actually dead  
kint relates the majority of the film in flashback  beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet in a policestation lineup in new york city  
along with dour keaton  kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus  stephen baldwin   mordantly sarcastic hockney  kevin pollak   and fenster  benicio del toro   whose speech is virtually incomprehensible  
together they plot to steal a small fortune in gems from  new yorks finest taxi service  crooked cops who provide escort service for visiting drug kingpins  
what follows is a shellgame of violence and betrayal  all hinging on the identity of a mysterious villain called keyser soze  
the film is brilliantly compact  its the shortest 90 minutes youll ever spend in a movie theater  
the cast is exceptional  
palminteri shines  he is brutally honest  a true cop  one who is going after the whole story because its there  
byrne is terrific  his brooding character  his seriousness is needed to supplement the hysteria of benicio del toro  who is a riot as fenster  
del toro is brilliant  his lines are a jumbled mess  you cant understand a word the man says  but it sure is damn funny  
baldwin is also very good  he is careful  methodical  and cold  a chilling character with a nasty streak of hotblooded sarcasm  
pollak is also terrific as usual  a very good character actor  
however  this will be forever known as the film that launched kevin spacey  
spacey is simply breathtaking  he is a force on screen  giving a magnetic performance that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze  
spaceys performance will be remembered for years  for it is the best of his career  it may be the best supporting actor performance in the last 50 years  
verbal kint is a clever storyteller  weak  oppressed  and gleefully evil to the bone  yet pitiful  one who draws sympathy  
the film is a good one  a decent film until the last 10 minutes  
what this film boils down to is the greatest ending in cinematic history  for me at least  
the revelation of keyser soze  the closing gunfights  it is something wondrous  
you have to see this movie about 10 times to believe what they do  
kudos to mcquarrie and singer for giving the audience a delightful  fastpaced  furiously plotdriven movie with quirky characters  phenomenal acting  and some hilarious moments stuck in the middle  
mcquarrie refuses to believe the audience is dumb  
without furnishing too many details  he concocts his story and lets it run  hoping the audience gets it at the end  
we do  
this might just be the finest cinematic puzzle ever created  
kudos also to singer and john ottman  who created the score  
they both create what is a true filmnoir setting  carefully setting up this intricate puzzle until the final  jarring ending  
there are flaws  more questions raised than answers  lack of character development  and no strong female characters  save one   
however  the plot  and that stunning ending  make up for all the flaws and more  
if you havent seen the movie  rent it  
watch it  
then rewind the tape  and watch it again  
trust me  youll be amazed

0	"overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name  based on shirley jacksons novel  the haunting of hill house   stars lili taylor as one of three  lab rats  that participate in a supposed  insomnia  study being initiated by liam neeson  
he is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it  
he drags the test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of  creepy  cgi effects scare the cast and try the audiences patience  
i know this question has been posed before  but why do people keep remaking good movies  
the original was a great psychological horror film  
this new version is dull and very decidedly not scary  
in fact  i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg13 horror movie that is scary  
unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening  then theres nothing in this film that will raise hackles  
i nearly fell asleep twice during the film  and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didnt seem to have such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed  
its sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly  
owen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house  and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability  
catherine zetajones  always nice to look at  is given the woefully underwritten role of a bisexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs  
liam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about whats going on as the rest of them do  
finally  poor lili taylor  the center of the film  gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her  
apparently  a subplot involving a tryst between zetajones and taylors characters was filmed but removed  
thats too bad  because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative  
this is jan de bonts second straight misfire  speed 2  cruise control being the first   
when is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better  
robert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that  
one should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset  
if de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything  it would have served to make the film terrifying  
what our mind fashions on its own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything  
apparently  yet another version of this story is being filmed under its original title  
i certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bonts version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had

1	"the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any mans life  especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances  
thematically in cinema  love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters  it is rare  however  for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benignis neoclassic drama  life is beautiful  
through a central cast of father  mother  and son  benigni demonstrates the wonderful  undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times  
life  is  beautiful for guido orefice  roberto benigni  directing himself here for the sixth time in his career   an italian jew  master con man  and aspiring waiter extraordinaire  
living in 1930s italy  he lives a carefree life of good fortune  it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora  nicoletta braschi   
although dora is already engaged  guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead  the two have a child named joshua  giorgio cantarini   
unfortunately for the happy family  the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps  
it is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movies theme of family love becomes the strongest  
although prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm  he relaxes the role to ensure his sons happiness  
now  instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora  he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right  
benignis performance is truly a wellrounded one  and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year  
the supports are all strong as well  but the movie truly excels in its script  
life is beautiful is a selfproclaimed fable  one which tells its story in grand  twopart fashion  
in certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a  saturday night live  spinoff  a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot  but in the movies second half the scripts circular nature becomes admirably obvious  
characters make reprise appearances in fine form  and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plots outcome  
in all  fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture  and novice moviewatchers may take this opportunity to see their first  artsy  film  
life is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone  and above all is a fine thematic picture

0	"cashing in on the success of white men cant jump and the failure of most of their solo vehicles  including the cowboy way and drop zone   wesley snipes and woody harrelson have reteamed  hoping that they can strike up the same success  
sadly  if this dismal  cliche ridden and mindnumbingly boring action pic is anything to go by  they havent got a chance in hell of even coming close  
this time out  the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops  
following several runins with their tyrannical boss  robert blake   who is obsessed with the  money train  a train which carries all the subways takingsand will let nothing stop it  now  theres  an original plot device   harrelsons character decides to try and take off with the cash  
along the way  both of them fall in love with the same womananother transit cop who also hates her boss  
this leads to the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find in a film of this standard  you were always the better brother etc  etc  etc    and doesnt help to add anything to the film  
given a better script  better performers in supporting roles and a shorter running time  the film almost went for two hoursor did it just feel like it    this film might  and i mean  might   have turned out okay  but as it is  it is stocked with the worst action film cliches  whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its painfully long running time  
robert blake  who plays the evil boss  has got to be the most pathetic bad guy in film history  
he sounds like wayne newton  and appears to think the best way to appear evil is to have your eyes bulging as though they are about to burst out of their sockets

if you look at the script as if it was an action film  it lacks originality and suspense  
but if you try to look at it as if it were a heist film  it is even worse  
the final robbery sequence is almost trivialised and the characters definitely aint butch and sundance  
the film isnt all bad though  
snipes and harrelson  when they arent using the dumb cliches that the script gives them  make an agreeable duo  and some of the stuntwork is indeed excellent  
but good stuntwork cannot save a bottomofthebarrel action movie  
if youre a really undemanding action freak  theres a chance youll like this  
but if youre looking for something original  or suspenseful  try somewhere elsei doubt youll find it here

0	"conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that childrens items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twentyfive or thirty years after the item was made  
thats when the kids of that time have jobs  disposable income and a desire to revisit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives  
check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and youll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks  
theres a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen  
boomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the workaday world for a long time  
theyd like to recapture some of that fun they remember from days of yore  
hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them  
directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time  
and for the most part theyre messing it up  
  mission impossible    lost in space    godzilla    zorro   
none of these successfully capture the originals  
none of these are even good films  
you can now add  the avengers  to the list  
the british television series began in 1961  
super secret agent john steed  thenpatrick macnee  and his third partner  emma peel  thendiana rigg  are the pair that the american audience fell for  
surrealistic and witty  the series fit the mood of the times  
the leatherclad rigg probably didnt hurt the ratings either  
after all its not a coincidence that you cant pronounce her characters name without  appeal   
now were in the nineties  
steed  nowralph fiennes  and peel  nowuma thurman  are battling evil genius sir august de wynter  sean connery  who is screwing with englands weather  
thats about as much of a plot as we have  
theres some footage about a lot of other things that either dont make sense or make even less sense  
we get betrayal for some unknown reason  
evil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film  
remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason  
theres a high tech hot air balloon  but i have no idea why anyones in it  
the spy agency is run by a man called  mother  who is in a wheelchair and a woman named  father  who is blind    at 
least in some scenes  
theres probably a reason for all of this  but well never know it  
macnee makes an appearance of sorts  
he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing  
a group of villains sits around a table  all clad in huge pastelcolored teddy bear outfits  
at first its humorous to watch the teddies waddle around  but then it becomes goofy  
the movie is a medley of clutter  confusion and wrong decisions around every corner  
it feels like major portions of the film are missing  
the storyline jumps rather than flows  
reportedly the film was recut several times  
this is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing  
theres one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by escher  
other than that  the effects are secondrate  
the weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes  
thurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it doesnt work  
she looks good  dresses in all the right fetish outfits but theres no spark  
fiennes fares even less well  
macnees steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor  
fiennes agent comes across as a dour kid in grownup clothes who has never been out of his home town  
even connery  one of the greatest living actors  doesnt have much of a presence outside of a few fiery scenes  
the action scenes are difficult to follow  
director jeremiah chechik  responsible for the atrocious remake of  diabolique   somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldnt be  
things happen  people move around  but even if  with the utmost effort  you were able to care about any of it  the scenes are bewildering  
the primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads  
witty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination  
admittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film  but theres no chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever  
one of emma peels first lines of dialog is  rules are made to be broken   
it doesnt get any better  
advance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone  
the release date was changed several times  
connery refuses to promote the film  
there was no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for warner brothers  
at least this way  they get something of an audience for the first weekend before the news gets out  
admittedly i havent seen an episode of the television series for a couple of decades  
my guess is that it would be severely dated now  
no matter how antiquated it might be  theres no doubt that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing  
theres no reason to waste any part of the last few days of summer inside watching this movie  
no reason at all

1	"capsule  a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg  
joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs  
it lets us see some new dinosaurs  is that an oxymoron   and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure  
the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious  
i had a good time  
  low 2  4 to 4  
here goes my credibility  
this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority  
i liked the third jurassic park film  
i even liked the second jurassic park film  
in a lot of ways jurassic park  the lost world was a creative threeway braiding together of michael crichtons novel the lost world  arthur conan doyles novel the lost world  and the classic silent film version of the doyle  
jp2 was an adventure  as doyle said   for the boy whos half man or the man whos half boy   
that is what all the jurassic park films are  
expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house  
the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomons mines had underwritten characters also  
jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs  
the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be  and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting  
some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds  
that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require  
i feel i got my moneys worth  
the story opens with eric  played by trevor morgan  and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica  
this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park  
they hope  no doubt  to get a look at the islands dinosaurs from a safe height  
the height is safe  but driving the boat in the water is not  
the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended  
flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant  sam neill  in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide  
he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs  
but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go  
doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple  william h  macy and tea leoni  who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs  
they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn  
he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once  
right  
guess what happens next  
jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2  
first it has alan grant and ellie sattler  laura dern  back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm  
sattler has a much smaller part in jp3  but is still present to tie this story to the first  
curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance  
one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other  suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time  
they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films  
of course  these raptors look a little different also  so perhaps they are a different related species  
not only are they more intelligent than in the past films  they are also more sympathetic  
in this story they are not just killing machines  they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition  
this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized  
each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs  of course  
in this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus  not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus  but larger and presumably more nasty  
it has a crocodiles head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright  
perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs  
sometimes they just move too fast to see  
occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision  
a few times we get unconvincing matte shot  particularly of the laboratory  
but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films  
the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williamss score for the first film  
joe johnston  who directs  already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky  
a team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay  
the film they have made is a long way from great cinema  but it still is fun  
if you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today  the film is for you  
i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale

1	"i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan  
ive seen some of his films  silkwood  backdraft  unlawful entry  and while he gave adequate performances  i have never been impressed with his work  
breakdown  then  is something of a surprise  
russell gives a fine performance  as do most of the cast  one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film  
to say that he holds the film together would not be completely true  but he does it no harm  
russell plays jeff  one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy  kathleen quinlan  cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life  
while journeying through the desert their car breaks down and  left helpless and stranded  jeff waves down a passing truck driver  j  t  
walsh  who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck  
because of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians  jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help  
that  it seems  is the last time jeff  or anyone else  sees her  
breakdown has been compared to several movies  george sluizers the vanishing  the original  hopefully  not his appalling hollywood remake   steven spielbergs duel and any number of hitchcock films  
as with these  breakdown does not  for the most part  stray down the conventional path of the american actionthriller  
jeff does not become a guntoting vigilante on the hunt for his wife  but instead becomes a scared  confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on  
when we do find out what has happened to amy  it does come as a slight disappointment  if only because its too early in the film  i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment  but this affects the film little  
russell  as mentioned earlier  is very good in his role  and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo 13  
j  t  
walsh  as the possibly evil truck driver  is terrific  he is one of the best of the fine batch of character actors hollywood doesnt seem to know what to do with  but director jonathan mostow is on the right track here  
the reason he makes such a great villain is that he actually looks like a real person  one anyone would be able to trust  which makes the plot that much more believable  
breakdown is what hollywood doesnt make enough of  a great thriller with believable characters and scenes that do  indeed  have viewers on the edge of their seats  
one of the most genuinely exciting films ive seen in a long time  
"
0	"this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled bluecollar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times  
it is hard to tell what is independent about this film  it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam  
it is the debut film for the director  who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults  a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s  where the mindset of all the characters depicted is grounded  but to see it in the 1990s is a different story  it is old news  
the love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesnt mean much  since their relationship remained undeveloped  
the introduction of the wiseguy angle and the loyality among buddies bit  are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tourdeforce performance by the star of the film  adrien brody as ray  
ray is the only son of a lowlevel mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield  new jersey  suburban basement  
ray sr   vincent  is now trying to make a go of it by running a small scale homerepair business  
his son lives with him and works unhappily as a shoe salesman  dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a business and marry his longtime waitress girlfriend joanne  sybil   
the title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman10b  which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film  you 
should be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that dont make sense  its constant brainless chatter between the buddies  their uneventful growing pains  and the despair of their lives  make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them  
desperate to make his dream come through  ray goes to a loanshark  humorously and menacingly played by james e  moriarty  and borrows 10 grand to bet on a  sure thing  at freehold raceway  
the horse loses and now ray has big problems  as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough  
there is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray  
he is undependable  meanspirited  and stupid  
so when his best friend mike  gallagher   the narrator of the film  gets a chance to sleep with his girlfriendwho cares  
the director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do  
as for rays gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off  the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen  
his buddies  the college student mike and the dependable butchie  gillan   and his old man  who he has this lovehate relationship with  rally to his aid  
and the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity  that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films  as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together  
there was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting  though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star  
because of his intensity and looks  he reminds me of sean penn  
"
0	"  ladybugs  is a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees  the pathetic team who beats the champs  cross dressing  and the presence of rodney dangerfield  
this picture doesnt play like a comedy for children  so who is it aimed at  
and why is it told like a 91minute sitcom instead of a feature film  
rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee  a total schmuck working at a huge corporation  
he obviously doesnt have a lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to get ahead  which he does by volunteering to coach the companys girls soccer team  
what a shock to learn chester and his assistant julie  jackee  know absolutely nothing about the game  and the players seem to know even less  
i didnt laugh  but for some reason it didnt annoy me that much  
chesters fiancee bess  graff  thinks he got a promotion in addition to the coaching position  and of course she has a slacker for a son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams  
jonathon brandis is a nice surprise as matthew  who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha to help out chester  probably because the girl he has a crush on plays on the team  what original story ideas    
what we get is just another retread of the  underdog sports team  mixed with some cross dressing  
unfortunately  the film isnt smart enough to play upon the drag aspect  
in fact  it downplays it so heavily its totally unbelievable  
could it be any more obvious martha is a boy  
he only wears a girls wig  without any makeup  and they dont even give him falsies  
brandis doesnt bother to mimic a girls voice either  
then there is a pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for a dress  but for what reason  
martha is only seen on the soccer field  why would they buy a dress for her  
just when we think the martha character is going to be useful  she disappears  and the story wanders aimlessly looking for a new plot to pick up on  
when bess discovers whats really going on she breaks up with chester  and the relationship is forgotten about and the film focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss  
this film couldve been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy  but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary  and bad at that   
theres just too much of a sitcom feel here  especially during the socalled serious moments  and all the confusion between the characters  
ive seen worse movies than  ladybugs   but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm  so even when it turns sour it doesnt seem as bad as it is  
dangerfield finally gets his respect in the end  but at what a price  
"
1	"on the basis of this film alone  i never would have predicted that  in two years  quentin tarantino would become the countrys biggest hotshot director  
reservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction  but is a much less substantive  more conventional crime story than the big pf  
heres what the two movies do have in common    
scenes of intelligent  amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical  chronological sequence graphic yet necessary violence an engaging crime story dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racialgender slurs three of the same actors  harvey keitel  tim roth and steve buscemi  a mexican standoff ending  although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf 
reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because its only got one story to tell rather than three  
crime lord joe cabot  veteran actor lawrence tierney  has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist  
the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated  
instead  they are all given code names off the color chart  mr  white  keitel   mr  pink  buscemi   mr  orange  roth   mr  blonde  michael madsen   mr  brown  tarantino  and mr  peach  tarantinos chin   
most of the movies running time is spent with mr  white and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive  
mr  orange  meanwhile  is on the floor  dying from a gunshot wound  
the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon  leading white to believe one of the five was an informant  
the storys background unfolds through a series of flashbacks  of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior to the crime  
eventually  blonde arrives with a police officer hostage  and what follows is a truly brutal  uncomfortable torture scene  
lets just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cops ear  
a lot of the time  reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heistgonewrong movie  but there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino  
the opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesnt live up to  as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on  among other things  tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonnas  like a virgin   
another scene involves roths lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana  
neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop  like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction  only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie  
reservoir dogs is good but its no pulp fiction

1	"i know it already opened in december  but i finally got around to seeing rushmore last weekend  and it was one of those rare oppritunites that i got to leave the theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price  
as the final scene closed out in happy slowmo fashion  i felt happy to have been priveleged enough to watch such a good display of filmmaking  
jason schwartzman  his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces and glasses  steals the show as max fischer  the most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades  but compensates for it by organizing most of the schools clubs and organizations  i  e  
the fencing team and writing and producing school plays  and often pulling outrageous stunts  one that eventually earns him an expulsion  
this stunt  building an aquarium on the schools baseball diamond  is a plot to steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross  olivia williams   
he funds this aquarium with the help of millionare herman blume  a very oscarworthy bill murray   who eventually finds himself falling in love with miss cross  
rosemary and herman begin datingand the fun begins  herman and max go at it head to head in a battle for miss cross  
herman manages to destroy maxs bike  while max cuts hermans brakes  and it goes on like this  
but eventually max realizes he is too young for miss cross  and he cant stand in the way of two people in love  
the academy of arts  sciences really messed up this year  they completely overlooked rushmore  and  if you ask me  it wasnt an accident   
it maybe wasnt best picture material  but it certainly deserved a screenplay nod  instead of elizabeth   and bill murrays absense from the ballot is a complete snub  
the entire mood of the film is one reason it is so good  at one point its fun  and the next scene can turn serious and dramatic  
the cinematography gives the movie an important feeling  as well  
i hope rushmore can overcome its oscar snubs  and be enjoyed by intelligent film goers

he tries to infuse some life into it  but it gets bogged down with sentimentality and a lack of sophistication  
sammy  billy crystal  is a struggling agent at the end of his ropes  
hes separated from his wife  serena  kathleen quinlan   and down to his last serious client    in a lowbudget film shooting in romania  
but in a turn of bad luck  sammy wrecks his car    only 
to be mysteriously saved by a giant  gheorghe muresan   
but this giant has a heart of gold  
he leads a solitary life  helping out the monks at a local monastery  
his only longing is for his long lost love  lilianna  joanna pacula   who has since moved to america  
sammy  seeing a golden ticket  convinces max to become an actor  represented by sammy  of course   and come back to america  
and so sam and max bounce from pathetic job to pathetic job  with sammy dangling a meeting with lilianna as a carrot before maxs nose  
but slowly sammys deceptions begin to haunt him  
but will he develop a conscience before the innocent max becomes disillusioned  
the humor in my giant isnt the worlds greatest  
mostly  it falls under the category of  boy    hes 
so big    
and that can only go so far  no matter how hard the talent tries  
still  its slightly amusing parts are longed for when the movie gets bogged down in sappy moments  
the films best moment  and thats not saying much  is a bit part by steven seagal  playing himself  
between executive decision and this  all of seagals best roles have been cameos  
maybe he should consider a change of work  steven seagal  the character actor  
gheorghe muresan isnt a natural actor at all  and his thick cottonmouthed accent certainly doesnt help  
in fact the only thing he adds to the role is his immense stature  
originally  the concept was designed several years ago for andre the giant  
andre also had a hefty accent  but he displayed a knack for comedy in the princess bride    something 
muresan should have studied for some pointers  
why does billy crystal continually get caught in these pathetic comedies  
hes proven that he can be much funnier than these formulaic films allow him to be  and yet  like a glutton for punishment  he keeps coming back  
that doesnt mean we have to

1	"by phil curtolo mel gibson  braveheart  gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howards ransom  
gibson plays tom mullen  a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath  played by gary sinise  forrest gump   and his band of lowlife thugs kidnap his only son for 2 million  
tom and his wife  kate  played by rene russo  tin cup  were instructed not to inform the police  but they contacted the fbi  
minutes later  an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo  broken arrow  are in toms house and wiring every phone  
the plot sounds average  just like most other kidnap movies that youve already seen  and it was nothing more than that  
that is until about halfway through the movie  
suddenly  tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying   this is your ransom  
but this is as close as you will ever get to it  
instead  i am offering this money as a reward on your head  dead or alive   
at this point  the plot thickened  and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspensefilled action film with great stunts  
the last half of the film is very well done  
another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise  as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie  
owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject   it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones   
before this movie  sinise played mostly  good guys   first in of mice  men  then in forrest gump  and most recently  in apollo 13  
but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a copgonebad  
gibson  of course  was just being gibson  in an oscarworthy performance  
although most of the scenes were quite predictable  ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film

0	"im guessing  and from the available evidence  its not a great guess  that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess  stupidity  ego and powermongering  
if so  the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history  
it has already been welldocumented that the original title  an alan smithee film  became a problem when miserable test screenings forced recuts against the will of director arthur hiller  prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors guildmandated pseudonym of alan smithee  
that left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas  as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor  
and you could just smell the disaster brewing  
if youre unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn  youll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up  
ostensibly  its a pseudodocumentary account of a director named alan smithee  eric idle  who loses control of a bigbudget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone  whoopi goldberg and jackie chan  all of whom appear as themselves   
when the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called  an alan smithee film   which  of course  it already is  smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it  
among the parties interviewed are the films producer james edmunds  ryan oneal  and studio boss jerry glover  richard jeni   who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them  
its bad enough that burn hollywood burn has  literally  not a single laugh for its entire  blissfully brief 84 minutes  
what makes it even worse is eszterhas insistence upon telling every bad joke not once  but twice or even three times  
michael ovitz references  showgirls references  oral sex references  whoopi goldbergted danson references  all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas stockintrade  
the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency  notably with the hilarious use of the word  feminist  as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film  
by the time coolio and chuck d show up as black independent filmmakers the brothers brothers  cleverly identified as  bad a  and  badder a   among other unprintable things   you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified  
those documentary captions  for all their leaden obviousness  allow the best insight into whats so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn  
not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit  eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears  
the producer is a  liar  who  slept in the white house   the media are  maggots  and  leeches  working for publications like  the new york slimes  and  newsleak   with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you dont miss the joke   
it doesnt even matter that eszterhas tags  penile implant  after his own name when he makes a cameo  because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign selfdeprecation  
this is a petulant schoolboys idea of satire  pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth  
the last stomachchurning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with outtakes over the closing credits  the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away  
perhaps it was just a final  desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind the film  or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career  
pity everyone involved with this excessive  egodriven  satire  of excess and ego  
its too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this  
otherwise  you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees

jay and silent bob  two new jersey stoners who hang out at the doorstep of convenience store selling pot  have appeared in almost all of smiths movies but  if im not mistaken  have not starred in one until now  
they find out that there is a movie based on the comic book that is based on them being made in hollywood  
this presents two problems  a  they havent received a penny in royalties and b  nerds on the internet   whats the internet    
are talking trash about them  
what is there to do except go to hollywood and stop this movie from being made  
on the way  theyre hitchhiking  because who knew you needed tickets to take a bus  
 they run into a group of hotties who pretend to be with an animalrights group  but are really jewel thiefs who parade around in charlies angelsstyle outfits  
of course  they set jay and silent bob up to look like the thieves  so that there is a massive manhunt going on during the second half of the film  
will ferrell  who again proves himself incapable of doing anything but sketch comedy  shows up as the wildlife marshal inspector who thinks the two have stolen a monkey  
the movie will probably please only smiths diehard  undiscerning fans  everyone else will be critical of this mindbogglingly stupid effort following some the sophisticated cinema that he churned out in years past  
any appeal the movie has will come from the  in  jokes  most of which i think i understood  but the movie is  in  to the point of absurdity  
there needs to be something holding it together other than its own smugness  
once jay and silent bob get to hollywood  the movie abruptly switches gears from grossout comedy to ridiculously broad hollywood satire  
countless  hot  movie stars and personalities make an appearance  from smith veterans matt damon and ben affleck to wes craven  but jay and silent bob strike back resorts to such lowbrow gags as another scream sequel with a monkey as the killer  
get it  
theyre so desperate for another movie  they ran out of ideas and used a monkey  
a monkey  
as often happens with writers who are working below what they are actually capable of  most of the really good lines are throwaways  while the big  painstaking gags mostly fall flat  
one of the funniest lines in the movie flies by  when asked to comment on the clitoris  dont ask   jay responds   the female clitoris   
kevin smith is a talented writer  though i agree that his films would be better off if hed let a real director take the helm   and jay and silent bob strike back holds true to his promise to make a more facetious film  
unfortunately  its also shapeless  pointless and largely unfunny  
smiths  verbal trampoline   as ben affleck once called his distinctive dialogue  takes a back seat to his dubious instincts as a populist filmmaker  
this was supposed to be the movie that didnt offend anyone  but its offensive because its terrible

0	"depending on your degree of cinematic acumen  last man standing is either a  a prohibitionera remake of akira kurosawas 1961 classic yojimbo  b  a prohibitionera remake of sergio leones 1964 classic a fistful of dollars  c  a prohibitionera action drama with a completely original storyline  
new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category  c  than in the other two combined  much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons  
the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing  which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the real source material  the dashiell hammett novel red harvest  
it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself  
this time around  the man with no name is played by bruce willis  a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico  
by all appearances  jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town  with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border  
one is headed by an irishman named doyle  david patrick kelly   the other is run by chicagoconnected italian mobster strozzi  ned eisenberg   
calling himself john smith  the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict  and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyles side  
but smiths allegiance is as uncertain as his name  and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them  
viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint  and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakescumbastardizations  
there is the happily ineffectual lawman  bruce dern   the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses affections  karina lombard   the barkeep who becomes our antiheros only friend  william sanderson   suspicious lieutenants  christopher walken and michael imperioli  to question the bosses trust in smith  a brutal beating  and a big fire  
director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids  including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity  but at least he doesnt try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture  
what he does do is nearly as big a mistake  and that is to provide a running voiceover narration by willis which rings of the standard hardboiled style of pulp detective fiction  
yes  that narration is full of cliches  but those are are not particularly troubling  
the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters  
they were a mystery  to the other characters in the film and to the audience  their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted  and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status  
with john smiths voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought  he becomes more mundane  just another tough guy trying to stay alive  
it feels like a hammett novel  all right  and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice  but it simply doesnt work  
the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence  and the man with no name takes no one into his confidence  
even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate  i cant imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction  
willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith  but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else  
christopher walken plays doyles brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of softspoken psychos  and there isnt another single character whom makes even the slightest impression  
with no compelling antagonist for smith  there is no buildup towards the expected showdown  and when it does come  that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about  
cinematographer lloyd ahern  who also did the only noteworthy work on hills 1995 flop wild bill  creates some nifty sunburned vistas  but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counterproductive narration  
sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original  theyll wonder what all the talk was about  
in the case of last man standing  it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about

1	"back in 1998 dreamworks unveiled their first computer animated movie  antz   
the film was critically acclaimed  and went on to gross almost 100m dollars at the domestic box office  
again in 1998 they released their traditional animated film  the prince of egypt  and it named an instant classic  and became a huge hit as well  
on a winning streak  they released  the road to el dorado  and it wasnt as big as they hoped  but still did ok  then they had the fantastic  chicken run  in the summer  
now in 2001 dreamworks has released what i can safely name  one of the top five best animated films  
shrek  mike myers  is about a loving  green ogre who lives in the woods of duloc by himself  
surrounded by fairy tale characters  he hopes somehow he would escape from everyone  
the ruler of duloc is the short  heartless lord farquaad  john lithgow   who is offering a reward to all the fairy tale creatures  if they are captured and arrested  
of course many of the owners turn them in for gold and silver  but one of those creatures is donkey  eddie murphy   
a regular donkey  except he talks and has a definite attitude  after his owner tries to disown him  he escapes into the woods  and runs into shrek  
lord farquaad however  has different plans and makes all the fairy tale creatures in the woods near shreks house  
to get his property back  and his life back shrek must rescue princess fiona  cameron diaz  so lord farquaad can be a king  
shrek wants his property back  but he never thought he would fall in love with princess fiona  
  shrek  is such an amazing film  that while watching it you cant help but just smile the entire time and wonder why that other production company cant make movies like this  
the animated graphics are so great  that they look every bit of realistic  
i saw previews for this film all last year  and i thought to myself wow  what a great movie this will be  
i must say i was not disappointed at all  and the film is the best of 2001 so far  and will go down on my best of 2001 list at the end of the year  
the voice talents are brilliant as well  with the comic genius mike myers  
in the past he has been a wayne  an austin  and a person married to an ax murderer  
now he is shrek  not only does he do the voice talent    but he is shrek  
with his irish accent  and he lovable personality  shrek becomes a friend to the audience and warms your heart  
eddie murphy who showed his voice talent in 1998s  mulan  does another bang up job here  and he is the comic relief in the film  
the tones of his voice  the lines he utters  and the jokes he gives  he even outdoes the comic genius of robin williams in  aladdin   
the always beautiful cameron diaz gives the voice of princess fiona and she does a great job as well  
she is very funny  and her character fits her to a t  of course the best supporting voice is john lithgow  who is personally one of my favorite actors  
he as the bad guy lord farquaad does a great job in being both sinister and funny at the same time  
at times i was so amazed by the computer graphics  that you cant help but just start looking at backgrounds  
there is many hidden jokes in the film  and even reflections of light on the screen like a camera  
  shrek  is a definite kid film  but not just a kid film for it is a film for the entire family to enjoy  
there are many adult jokes in the film that the kids wont get  but the parents will be laughing  
believe me though  everyone will be laughing the entire way through  
in the end   shrek  gives a very important message to its audience to enjoy and be who you are  
everybody out there is beautiful in their own way  even though it may be inside  
theres not many words that can praise  shrek  enough  but my words to you is to stop what you are doing and see this movie now

1	"i like movies with albert brooks  and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks  
lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies  
his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today  inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator  
you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film  while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent  talk films  which are finding their way into theaters  
the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with  but even if we cant  brooks has the talent to make them comfortable  and therefore we laugh  
teenagers and jim carrey fans probably wont find an albert brooks movie very funny  but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will  
put simply  brooks comedy is intelligent  
mother is albert brooks latest film  and it does not disappoint  
brooks plays john henderson  a middleaged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce  
he makes an attempt at dating  but fails miserably  
he then has dinner with his brother jeff  rob morrow   a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life  
jeff has a good job  a loving family  and most of all  a warm relationship with their mother beatrice  debbie reynolds   
after dinner  john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice  and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunkydory the dialog is  
in comparison  beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him  and john gives it right back to her  
at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart johns life  she says   i love you   and john replies with   i know you think you do   
the thing is  beatrice is not overt with her criticisms  but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nitpicking and guilt loading  
its the kind that goes something like   yes  dear  i think you do that wonderfully  but      
it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy  
theres always the big but  
john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women  either because of his flawed selfesteem caused by his need for validation  or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner  
he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home  he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out  and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is  
  a great experiment   he calls it  
brooks own brand of humor really shines in this film  especially in the interaction john has with his mother  
theres a scene where john has just arrived at his mothers house  and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito  and having explained to his mother about the  great experiment   beatrice asks   now explain to me again why you dont want to stay at a hotel   
she still doesnt get it  and it is absolutely hilarious  
in the same scene  we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh  
she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over  
when john points out the ice on the sherbet  beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze  
  youve named the ice   
asks john  
hes also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator  such as a twentypound block of cheese  
  the freezer was a good invention   says john   but its not supposed to be used for everything  
thats why its smaller than the refrigerator   
its something most of us find strangely familiar  
brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur  
for example  in defending your life  his and meryl streeps characters are in a comedy club having a discussion  
when theyre finished and walk out  brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line   and so the moral is  if you have to fart  go outside   
you dont know what the joke was because you couldnt hear him during the entire scene  but i must have laughed for the next five minutes  it seemed so out of context  
in this film  brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene  
i dont want to give them away  but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past  
johns purpose for staying with his mother is to learn  and we as the audience learn right along with him  
his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with  but as john spends more time with her  we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth  
watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way  
on screen  brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character  you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world  
in a way  hes very much like yosarian of catch22  expect with something of an attitude  
casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect  
she assumes the part with ease  even moving and speaking a little slowly  and is just so adorable its hard to get mad at her character  
this only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her  
as his first choice  brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice  but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband  who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimers disease  
that may be just as well  since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely  
rob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mothers favorite and  for all his success in his job and family  is slowly exposed as a mamas boy  
the only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes  
a solid connection is not really made between johns troubles and his reasons for living with his mother  
additionally  the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals  and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting  how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this   
beatrice  you must think im some kind of moron  
john  no  i think your someone who thinks im a moron  
beatrice  well  it takes one to know one

1	"synopsis  leonard shelby  pearce  is a former insurance investigator on the trail of the man who killed his wife  
leonard has only a few clues to the murderers identity  to make matters worse  he suffers from a condition which inhibits the creation of shortterm memories  meaning that leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier  
because of this  leonard is forced to rely on notes he leaves for himself  
  memento  traces the investigation back in time from its apparent culmination  
review   memento  is the sort of movie i wish id written  i can think of no higher praise than that  
i am envious that nolan has concocted such a brilliant  involved  original movie as this  
an instant film noir classic   memento  is virtually flawless  
the script is unlike any i have ever seen  a notable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity  
although the idea of starting at the  conclusion  of the plotline and then moving backward in time to the  start  is not entirely new  never before have i witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence  
  memento  is endlessly exciting and inventive  a rare story which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself  and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre  
and it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality  there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively  
nolans direction is equally effective  never losing its crispness and clarity despite  memento  s challenging gimmick  
and to top everything off  all the performances rise to the occasion  
pierce is terrific as the troubled leonard  moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie  and pantolianos teddy achieves a splendidly affable yet sinister quality  
  memento  may be the years best screenplay  and is certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2001

1	"as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot  mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences  
you know the type  his shirt is always shredded  his face always scarred  he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a  to kill  list for his enemies  
oscarhungry directorexecutive producer roland emmerich did not intend to  but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century  
as gibson delivers lines like   before this war is over  i am going to kill you   schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind  
oddly enough  the patriot is as much an epic threehourtearfest like gladiator  as it is a ninetyminute guilty pleasure  
at times absorbing  at others enjoyably insipid  this is good  bloody summer fun  
i probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend  
some of the images are so zealously americanized  the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example   that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it  
like emmerichs id4  this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all  
sure its predictable and melodramatic  but for a moment after leaving the theater  i was dumbfounded with patriotism  
and isnt that the point of the patriot  
gibson plays benjamin martin  the lionized french and indian war veteran  who  at the beginning of the film  is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away  
he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants  not slaves    
as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away  martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields  
but when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel  jason isaacs   martin quickly decides to save the day  or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich   
forming a band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war  martin becomes the number one target of the british army  
the best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right  
every time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy  to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis  tom wilkinson  face was priceless entertainment  
and as the tension gradually formulates with the running time  a final battle is inevitable  
as for the numerous battle scenes  they are expertly done  
clearer and more realistic than those of gladiator  the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating  
you really get a sense of how warfare was performed during that time period  
everything is performed in an orderly  but still quite gory  fashion  one side shoots  then the other side  then the remaining soldiers charge  
its organized  strategic and  according to martin  ineffective  
there is a very interesting contrast between the traditional battle style and martins takenoprisoners method  
what drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions  are the originally brutal tactics of colonel tavington  
played wonderfully by jason isaacs  tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians  who nervously avoid eye contact  
this character is viciously evil  he kills women and children and then laughs about it on the way home  even his eyes are evil  
his portrayal has sparked some controversy in britain  some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as  cowardly  and  sadistic   
i disagree with this accusation  
tavington does not represent his country  his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his general  
besides tavington  the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized  
and stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds of movies  why give the audience a reason to love the bad guys  
heck  why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys  
the patriot is three hours of fictional fireworks  
with an action hero seeking revenge and a comic book villain ready to take him down  its a lethal weapon for the colonial times  
god bless america  
and god bless the patriot

1	"it must be tough to be a mob boss  
just ask paul vitti  robert deniro   a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing  
i can believe it  too  one cant even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when hes forced to choose between an ice pick  baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with  
suffering from reoccurring panic attacks  paul decides he needs to consult some professional help  
and who better than billy crystal  
after appearing in bottomofthebarrel flops  fathers day and my giant  crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here  
playing vittis private shrink  the two very different stars strike an unorthodox  but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish  
casting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an injoke  i think  
placed in this mobsters shoes  deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather  part ii and casino  
its obvious hes having a lot of fun doing so  
the man behind the camera is harold ramis  whose credits include ghostbusters  as writer and star   and his best directing effort  the bill murray vehicle  groundhog day  
ramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows whats funny  and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors  
the only character who weakens the payoff is crystals bridetobe  lisa kudrow   
playing the same dumbeddown role as she does in friends  kudrow is amusing  but doesnt fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped  
the supporting cast sparkles  
joe viterelli is hilarious as jelly  vittis pea brained righthand man  and chazz palminteri is a show stopper playing a fellow mobster whos in desperate need of the definition of closure  
the movie manages to maintain consistent chuckles throughout  putting the emphasis on 3 or 4 really big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides  
the situation is just too cute to resist  
its unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand  
but hey  if youre in the mafia  using obscenities probably comes naturally  
and near the end  seeing billy crystal attempt to walk and talk like a mob boss is truly a special treat

1	"im an avid fan of the  alien  saga  so this review is obviously a tad biased  at least i admitted it   
of course  that doesnt mean that im gonna be giving this a fourstar review or something  because  alien  resurrection   the fourth film in the coolashell series is not an absolutely amazing film  much like the first two were  
however  its a very good film which never fails to entertain  and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series  
in short  i had a good time  
  alien  resurrection  leaves off 200 years after the last one  where our heroine protagonist  ellen ripley  sigourney weaver   the science fiction genres answer to job  had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body  waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one  
of course  the last one wasnt very great or anything  i liked it  though not as much as the first two   and more importantly  it wasnt financially successful  a tawdry 55 million bucks    
so back we are  with ripley back as a clone  which means we get another little satirical look at cloning  not that thats a bad thing  but its becoming a cliche   
so shes cloned aboard an even more futuristiclooking ship called  the auriga  by some doctors  including the necessary bad government guy  dr  wren  played by j  e  freeman  as well as the littleseen dr  gediman  played by none other than brad douriff   mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her  
once you get past the fact that you cant figure out where they got her blood  although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one   the films okay  
also on board are a band of mercenary pirates  including michael wincott  ron perlman  kim flowers  raymond cruz  dominique pinon  a jeunet sytable  and    winona ryder  who plays analee call  who turns out to have a bit of a secret  i wont state it  but unless youve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years  you probably know all about it  although its nicely covered up   
theres a bit of a nonsexualyetslightlyhomoerotic relationship between her and ripley  but its never really deepened enough  
oh well  
well  as you might have guessed  the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship  
and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship  including some shocks  dan hedaya  for instance  whos death is comical yet sad since  well  hes dan hedaya   and the remaining people  about 7 or 8  are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth  
of course  the plot is all balderdash  and just an excuse for some good old  alien  brand fun  
the real focus of the series seems to be on style  not really substance  although theres always a bit of it  most notably in  aliens  with the relationship between ripley and the little girl   
whats interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach  
  alien  is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights  
  aliens  is a wild  tense thriller  
  alien 3  is a bleak  moody piece of seminoir  
  alien 4  is kind of like an offbeat french film  filled with lots of humor  and cool scares  
jeanpierre jeunet  without his usual directing partner  marc caro  creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like  das boot  has  with echoes hinting at a possible threat  
the chills in the film are really cool  especially with the music  which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes  theres the most tense surgery scene since  faceoff  towards the beginning   
and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that  
this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others  
there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed  
one is the aforementioned surgery scene  
another one takes place between call and ripley  which is just awesome  
the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense  thrilling  and jawdropping scenes in the entire saga  with a small allusion to jeunets earlier film   delicatessen    
and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool  with a lovely allusion to  goldfinger    
but the best scene in the entire film  im sure im not the first to mention it  takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her  she has a an  8  tatooed on her arm   
it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga  
the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work  as it never really deapens a lot of the characters  
however  it does make us care about most of them  so that when theres very little of them  and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow  we are pretty scared  
and  yeah  there are some very funny lines  ripley   who do i have to fuck to get off this boat    
johner   well  i can get you off  
but not this ship    
the acting is good all around  with standout performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner  and leland orser  the poor bastad in  se7en  who performed the  lust  sin  as an anxietyridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him  
winona ryder is good  but not amazing like she usually is  although she meshes well with the film   
of course  and as usual  sigourney weaver steals the show  
playing a variation on the ripley character  less emotional  and more rude and bitter   she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable  
shes not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for  aliens   but shes just awesome  
overall  its a thrilling  entertaining film which doesnt really amaze like the first two  but is much more amazing than the third installment  
the style is the best part of the film  which isnt really a bad thing  but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply  
but its entertaining as hell  and its definitely fit for the  alien  series  
"
0	"  party camp   is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies ive seen in awhile  
a late ripoff of the  meatballs  series  the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk  
thats really about all that can be said about the  plot  because nothing much happens  except that the main character  wisecracking jerry  andrew ross   has the hots for a cute blonde  kerry brennan   and there is a big contest in the climax  
how fun  
since   party camp   has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved  the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative  
its not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality  but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this  the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex  
even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick  
at least  then  it wouldnt have been such a chore to sit through  
never before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat  
the comedy was easy to spot  but it wasnt the least bit funny  
it was groaninducing  
constantly throghout  i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything  
so what saves   party camp   from the dreaded zero star rating  
well  thats simple  jewel shepard  as a flighty bimbo  was admittedly fun to watch  
although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash  at least if the film had centered on shepard  she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid  lowbudget teen comedy

0	"die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco  inferior to the original in every respect  
place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson  who wrote the films pathetic screenplay  
every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor  
the plot is altogether implausible  the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower  leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land  
the film has zero credibility  and all of the characters come off as cliched  cardboard cutouts  
so much for the script  
how about the action  
well  lets put it this way  director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan  who directed the original  as well as the hunt for red october and predatorall standouts for their hairraising suspense  
by contrast  harlin doesnt have a clue when it comes to choreographing action  and consequently  die hard 2 never picks up steam  
die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute  
in fact  the movie often seems deliberately campy  and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad its good  
you do laugh  but you laugh at the film  not with it  
die hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff

0	"for  original sin   the road to the screen has been rocky  
initially slated for release last november  the film was bumped twice  finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001  
advance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics  generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands  
so is  original sin  really all that bad  
yes it is  but the melodrama does offer some rewards  
the location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of ta  with angelina jolie providing the  t  and antonio banderas the  a    
more importantly  the movie is entertainingly bad  
veteran readers know that  as a rule  i dont encourage people to patronize lousy films  
most of the time  there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides  the  lets go laugh at the failings of others  mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable  
but things are different this summer  
quality films  to put it mildly  have been few and far between  so as far as im concerned  its fair to find our kicks where we may  
  original sin  will never join such treasures as  valley of the dolls    road house  and  showgirls  in the bad movie hall of fame  but itll do until something worse comes along  
the film  adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel   waltz into darkness   which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film   mississippi mermaid    opens in a turnofthecentury prison  as jolies character  slated for a dawn execution  tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny  
the freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like   this is not a love story  it is a story about love   
wary of local golddiggers  cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas  banderas  makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america  listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign golddiggers  
a practical man  luis chooses a frumpy looking lady  hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children  
imagine his surprise when his fianc  e  julia russell  jolie   turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo  
julia explains that she sent a different womans image because she didnt want to be selected solely for her pretty face  
luis then confesses his deception  leading julie to state  with great significance   we have something in common  we are both not to trusted   
after their wedding  luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking  with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible  
jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun  although the filmmakers insistence on using one of banderas legs to cover jolies crotch makes it look like hes trying to climb her  
luis  the stupidest man who ever lived  immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia  despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded  
his blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up  
luis must force julia to write to her sister emily  who is frantic over her lack of communication  
shortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird  it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck  
finally  when she cleans out his accounts and disappears  luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong  
incidentally  if youre afraid im giving too much away  rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie  leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists  a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass  
along the way  private detective walter downs  played by thomas jane  who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie  61    turns up  hired by the frumpy womans sister to find out what happened to the real julia  
luis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist  having decided that if he cant have her  he will kill her  
oh  the pathos of it all  
the cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story  adjusting their performances accordingly  
banderas is suitably impassioned  while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting  and with those lips  she can really pout   
as for thomas jane  he starts off acting suspicious and cagey  then accelerates to a snidely whiplash level of nastiness  
his most startling moment comes when  to prove his power to humiliate  he forces luis against a wall  verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a fullon kiss  
if anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape  show them this chilling scene  
and if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler  show them  original sin

0	"can a horror movie truly be called a horror movie if it has no scares  suspense  or even eerie elements  
i think not  but thats what children of the corn 666  issacs return wants us to believe  
the sixth installment in the horrible  worn out series is by far the worst to date  
unlike the other five chapters  children of the corn 666 is a confusing  brainless thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather than slasher horror  but either way  none of these movies are the least bit scary  
the film follows hannah  natalie ramsey  a teen looking for her mother in gatlin  nebraska  on the eve of her 21st birthday  
what starts out as a daughter in desperate search of her long lost mother turns into the story of hannah being the first daughter of the children of the corn  who roam the cornfields looking for adults to murder  
thats about all thats understandable in the film  as after we learn this much  issac  john franklin  who led the children of the corn in a previous chapter  now an older  strange man  is looking for hannah to fulfill his prophecy  
and this is supposed to make sense  
really  
from the start the film is unclear of where its going  not developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details across the table  constantly introducing new characters without personalities or the slightest hint of an individuality  and sub plots that have nothing to do with what seems to the main focus of the film  
the film runs at a short 78 minutes  but it seems to be more in the vicinity of two hours  as the bleak  slow pacing makes children of the corn 666  issacs return excruciatingly boring  
plot holes are everywhere in tim sulka and john franklins unbelievably horrible script  as nothing is accomplished or clear when the film reaches its conclusion  
everyone and everything involved with children of the corn 666  issacs return  namely writers john franklin and tim sulka  along with director kari skogland  should crawl under a rock  and hope no one sees their horrible work of trash  
the bottom line  horrible  horrible  horrible  
another attempt to revive this worn out genre falls flat  
and whats with that title  
the devil has nothing to do whatsoever with this film  
lets pray that this is the finale in one of the worst current film series  
one of the worst horror films in years  
"
1	"director jan de bont certainly knows how to make top quality action films  
you need look no further than die hard  he was director of photography   speed and last years twister for examples of his hi octane  edge of your seat thrill prowess  
speed 2 is no exception  
this time  the action takes place on a huge cruise liner  on which sandra bullock and jason patrick are trying to develop their relationship  
yep  thats right  no keanu reeves this time  but fear not  jason patrick is more than up to the job  
speaking of which  the job at hand is to stop completely bonkers terrorist  willem dafoe  from crashing the liner into a huge island  after stealing a diamond collection  
the reason for this act of destruction is revenge  
after years of working for the company that builds cruise liner computers  he contracts copper poisoning and is retired  
naturally  what entails next is a lot of runningjumping about and general high quality action as jason patrick does his level best to save the day  
thinking back on this film  you cant help  but admire its structure  
the way  willem dafoe initiates his plan and throws red herrings to the crew and passengers  
the race against time to save the liner from crashing  and of course  the finale chase scence  
  although this is ruined by an over the top  one too many stunt and explosion   
simple in construction  effective in its execution  and the result  a clear and concise  highly enjoyable action film  
the acting is adequate  although its darned obvious that sandra bullock is only in it to create a hot totty appeal to the men  and she does that perfectly    jason patrick fills the action hero role superbly and willem dafoe is just great as the crazed terrorist  
overall  speed 2 is a most enjoyable thrill ride  
not up to its predecessors high calibre but very good all the same  
there is plenty going on  some of the thrills are quite tense and it also proves that you do not need blood and guts to make a good action movie  
"
1	"as with his other stateside releases  jackie chans latest chopsocky vehicle  mr  nice guy  is contrived  blockheaded  and lacking in narrative logic  
but also like those other films  it is a highly enjoyable ride  
once again  chans screenwriters  here edward tang and fibe ma  have taken the easy way out and named their stars character simply jackie  with no last name  
this jackie is a worldclass chef who cohosts a popular cooking show on australian television  
of course  jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist  and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporters  gabrielle fitzpatrick  expose of a drug dealing ring  
other plot details  involving a videotape and a biker gang  are irrelevant  in fact  as is the case with most chan films  the plot itself is just about irrelevant  
the sole purpose of mr  nice guys existence are chans comic fight scenes  and those here do not disappoint  
director samo hung  who has a cameo role   a longtime collaborator of chans  does not waste any time putting chan in action  diving headon into a wild chasefightshootout after a brief cooking show prologue  
other impressive set pieces follow  most notably a chase in a mall  which directly leads to some frenzied  if cliched  can you say fruit cart    business involving a runaway carriage  and an extended latefilm sequence at a construction site  in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards  cement mixers  and a deadly buzzsaw  
none of the action sequences in mr  nice guy are as spectacular as supercops thrilling helicoptertrain finale or rumble in the bronxs daring leap between two buildings  nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor  respectively  
but the action delivers  even if the energy peters out before the films end  the finale  as spectacular as it is  is a letdown for fans of chans athletic prowess   
filmed almost entirely in english  even so  the voices of some englishspeaking actors are laughably dubbed   mr  nice guy hints at jackie chans latest transition to hollywood productions  he made illfated attempts with 1980s the big brawl and 1985s the protector   next in the pipeline is rush hour  a stateside production costarring chris tucker  
hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown  and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr  nice guy  for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands  much like they have been before  
"
1	"capsule  the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen  
one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse  
the idea is something about ghosts and the internet  
the film has an amazing apocalyptic style  
  2  4 to 4  
perhaps the most disturbing  and disturbed   
filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa  
his films all seem to have one style  bleak  
the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold  
little known in the us to date  his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver  
most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid  
his 1998 film cure  with one of his niftiest ideas  is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with  
cure is probably his classic  
last year he released seance  a remake of seance on a wet afternoon  
that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a nonsupernatural story  
pulse is kurosawa back on form  
taguchi  a young computer expert  is late with his delivery of some important software  
two coworkers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment  
taguchi  acting very strangely  lets his friends look for the missing software  
meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain  
when he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself  
if that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildewlike spot on the wall  
taguchis computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus  
people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide  
but they are not entirely dead  
their spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet  
people who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost  
if they say yes  they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow  
the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist  
this is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing  like a computer disk   
instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses  
there is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers  
leave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death  
this is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work  
it may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death  but whatever it does convey is nightmarish  
kurosawa  who directs his own screenplay  ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion  
frequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact  
his plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange  
junichiro hayashi  the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawas films  creates a dark  cold  and gloomy tone  
images are obscured by semilighting or are behind plastic curtain  
scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might  
people are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence  
seeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary  
kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock  but a deeper metaphysical dread  
of any horror filmmaker in the world  kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch  
i rate this metaphysical look at isolation a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale

0	"i think we should  as responsible citizens  all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie  
hes changing the cinema as we know itand for the worst  
i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic momentsprologues  epilogues  etc  the premise  a lawyer cant lie for a day  
ho  ho  
normally a movie made from this premise would be terriblemr  
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable  
i laughed onceand i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing  
grinding doesnt begin to describe  
it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that  if you are a normal person  you leave feeling sick  
when its not trying to be funny  its trying to be melodramaticbut its just annoying  stupid and sappy  
at best  
this movie is intended to make people laugh  yes  not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound  
but  it fails on every possible level  
it fails to be funny  
it fails to be insightful  
it fails to be suspensful  
it fails to be fun  
they should pay people to see it  
it suceeds on one levelit makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles  for having lived  
if you go in with the intention of coming out alive  please make sure that you are overly fond of boob  fart  pimple and fat jokesotherwise you will go insane  
yes  literally insane

it is boring  stupid  melodramatic and in the end ugly

0	"the most depressing thing about the depressingly pedestrian james bond film  the world is not enough  is its final frame  white letters on a black background proclaiming  james bond will return   
oh i certainly hope not  
with pierce brosnan in his third and reportedly last goround as james bond 007   the world is not enough  is the best example to date that  enough  is enough  
in this  the 19th chapter in the seeminglyendless franchise featuring ian flemings debonair british secret agent who likes his martinisand his nemesesshaken not stirred  the subinspired screenwriters have chosen to rehash all of the setups  stunts  and sexy encounters of the previous 18 bond flicks rather than coming up with anything the slightest bit original  
weve got previouslyused speedboat chases  ski chases  and sticky situations aboard nuclear submarines  
weve got a couple of hottotrot babes without an ounce of acting ability between them  
weve got a postcold war megalomaniac bent on world domination slash destruction  here played by a skinheaded robert carlyle with mean  lean panache   
and  as has been the case since 1977s  the spy who loved me   weve got a plot that has nothing whatsoever to do with anything conceived by mr  fleming  
weve also got a main title song by garbage to which  with very little effort  you can fit the lyrics to  both  songs from  tomorrow never dies   
while originality was never the series strong suit  the films were almost always fun  with at least some thought going into the nonstop stunts  
i cant think of one memorable setpiece in the entireand very dull  the world is not enough   
in addition  michael apted  yes  the respected director of such films as  coal miners daughter    nell   and the  28up  documentary series  takes embarrassing advantage of the full range of bond clich  s  
you get the  talking killer  plot deviceyou know the scenario  the bad guy has the good guy at his mercy yet waxes poetic just long enough to die of old age  
and you get a slew of highpriced assassins who cant hit a barn door at 20 paces  in the films opening minutes  of an endless 128   bond chases a sultry sniper along the thames and the leatherclad lovely fails to hit bonds soupedup  fishing boat  with a bazooka when he pulls within a few feet of her  
later  she takes off in a hot air balloon with bond dangling from a guy rope beneath her but is still unable to take him out  
these reliable absurdities are more frustrating than usual since there are no distractions other than occasional ads for luxury automobiles  vodka  or credit cards  
in and among the rampant product placements  brosnan grapples with carlyle   braveheart  s sophie marceau  as former kidnap victim slash heiress elektra king  shes terrible    wild things   denise richards  as a nuclear physicist lord help me  shes laughable   and judi dench as m  dame judi brings the only shred of dignity to a series that has long since jettisoned its selfrespect  about the time roger moore inherited bonds walther ppk   
brosnan goes through the motions with the grace and charm youd expect of the former  remington steele  star  but even he has to be thinking theres more to life than an easy paycheck  
hes given plenty of wiseacre asides to deliver  but only one of them  i dont know any doctor jokes  made me chuckle  although  i thought christmas only comes once a year  is more in keeping with the series penchant for grownworthy puns

0	"at times  youd think edtv would be an entertaining film  
i mean  who can resist the story of your average joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day  
but this average joe  ed perkuny   matthew mcconaughay   is a sappy  lifeless creation that wanders around  trying to solve everyones problems and settle his own  
mcconaughay is awful  especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with a 3 week beard and torn jeans  
frankly  he had more charm in the devestating flop the newton boys  
he overacts in every way  his overexaggerant body language  obsession with kissing women every second he gets the chance  and that cliched scene where he loses someone in his life  and drops to his knee and cries  
the rest of the cast is very good  especially martin landau  as eds stepfather   who plays a cute role as the closetodeath old guy that makes all the witty comments  
jenna elfman is good   but a little overemotional   her main problem is that she keeps getting sucked into bad films  i  e  
cant hardly wait  and krippendorfs tribe  
woody harrelson  as eds brother ray  does his usual eggheaded role  with his comic wit as well  he wrote a book entitled   my brother pissed on me    
elizabeth hurley is perfectly cast as the easy slut  and dennis hopper  in a quick cameo as eds biological father  is a nice choice  ironically coming after the role he turned down as christof in the truman show   
ellen degeneres stood out as the executive who  after awhile  decides the show must not go on much to the opposite of the head exec  rob reiners opinion  
i hate to compare this film to the truman show  but the fact is  i was ashamed to see this movie  
it felt that i had dropped from college to kindergarten after seeing truman and ed  
edtv had no real wit or genius  it was typical hollywood  
extracting the tv part of the movie  you have the simple plotline  man steals brothers girlfriend  girlfriend leaves town  man gets new slut girlfriend to feel like he can move on  slut breaks up with him  real girlfriend comes back  and voila  you have a romance  
i got so restless during this movie  i almost walked out  
the only reason it doesnt drop below a  c  grade is because of the fine supporting performances

i like it  
i like breathing through it

1	"wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon  denise richards  and neve campbell that deals with all the issues  sex  love  murder  and betrayal  
the setting of the film is a town named blue bay  
it consists of many swamps and slums and  on the other hand  rich estates owned by the towns different benefactors  
the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the towns ritzy  expensive high school  
it is here that we meet all of the core characters  
theres guidance counselor sam lombardo  police officers ray duquette and gloria perez  dark mysterious senior suzie toller  and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan  
we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor  but none more than kelly  
throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape  
shortly after  suzie  too  confesses that sam raped her as well  
this pushes kellys sex craving mother  sandra  to stop at nothing until sam is convicted  
during the trial  kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her  
however  it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls  it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor  
after sam is cleared  kellys mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her  
it is then revealed that sam  kelly  and suzie were all in on it together  
it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda  
matt dillon stars as sam lombardo  
sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into  and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage  
he isnt the obvious best of actors  but dillon does give a convincing performance  
however  his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film  making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles  although he never had many to start out with in the first place  
neve campbell  who most people relate to scream and scream 2  plays blue bay outcast suzie toller  
suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film  
campbell is very successful with this character  adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch  
playing kelly van ryan is denise richards  
kelly is your typical  rich  sexy  head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses  like her sexpot mother sandra  
one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother  
denise richards  still hot off the press from starship troopers  gives the most interesting performance in the entire film  
in the beginning  kelly looks to be a paper thin character  but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy  but dominating as well  
kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette  
this character looks to be one of the most boring  predictable in the film  
however  it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story  
still  the film doesnt seem to gain much from bacons performance  only his name  
in the supporting cast  theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan  daphne rubinvega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez  and bill murray shines as sams lawyer  ken bowden  
hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film  
although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller  the eroticism  which is portrayed with good taste  is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters  
this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with its share of twists  
"
1	"sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to  
its not the time or the distance  its the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy  
yet somehow  the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story  
the wings of the dove fits the pattern  
kate  helena bonham carter  and merton  linus roache  are in love  
merton  a newspaper writer  would like to marry kate  
but kates  job   if you will  is to be a member of the british upper class  
her father lost all of her familys money  but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man  
naturally  a newspaper writers wages dont count as  rich   
kate leads him on  but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder  ultimately because hes not marriageable  
kates american friend millie  alison elliot  stops in for a visit on her way to venice  
at a party  millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees  
kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie  he might forget about her  
it appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup  
merton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it  
he is still in love with kate  and will accept no substitute  
the three of them  along with a fourth friend  elizabeth mcgovern  end up on holiday in venice together  where their interactions are quite complicated  
lets sum up  millie has fallen for merton  
merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate  
kate loves him but cant marry him  so on the one hand shes trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy  but on the other hand shes jealous of them as a couple  
a clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick  dying  in fact  
at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies  
millie will leave her money to merton  who will then be rich enough to marry kate  
she lets merton know of her schemes and  since it will help him win kate  he reluctantly agrees  
kate leaves venice so that the two ms can be alone together  
merton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her  
hes not sure he can separate the two  
kate finds that shes not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else  
the brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved  
without revealing the details  suffice it to say that the situation ends badly  
the title refers to the object of mertons vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament  
one is left with feelings of regret and despair  
what started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed  anger  and jealousy  
an interesting thought struck me after the movie was over  and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir  
a couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after  
their involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other  and after a few things go wrong  the whole idea seems like an awful liferuining mistake  
i wouldnt call the wings of the dove a film noir  but the comparison is interesting  
as i have acknowledged before  i am not a wonderful judge of acting  but i liked the performances from roache and elliot  
roache successfully conveyed his characters ambivalence toward millie  near the end  he hugs her  at first staring into space  as if hes thinking about his plan with kate  then giving that up to fully embrace millie  
millies part didnt require as much range  but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible  
i will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same lowtraffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion  
their settings are far removed from my personal experience  geographically  historically  and socially  
still  the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over

1	"one fun activity for parents during the holidays is to suggest an old film and see if they can interest their kids  
although blackandwhite films are frequently viewed as suspect  ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind  
and if you can find a colorful action film  even if it is from six decades ago  then there is a real possibility of a take home hit  
so it was in our family when we wandered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day and picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood  a high spirited version of the walter scott story  
nominated for the 1938 academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngolds melodramatic music  ralph dawsons fast paced editing and carl jules weyls lush sets  the film is probably best remembered for errol flynns charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley  a  k  a  robin hood  
flynn  with his handsome figure and toothy smile  charms the audience while clearly having a high old time himself  
let me cut to the chase and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household  
the littlest rhodes  jeffrey  age 8  liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times and maybe more  
ill let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review  
simply stated  the film derives its success from being one of the best of its genre  the swashbuckler  
robin  with a smile from eartoear  fights off a hundred men without a scratch  
although the picture can be considered as little more than a 1930s james bond  the production values and the acting raise it above that level  
robin hood is a classic story of rich and poor  
robin steals from the rich and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows  
in this movie  however  he seems much less interested in income redistribution than in fighting for his king and country  
robin  with his courage and athletic skills  serves as a role model for kids  
and with the lovely olivia de havilland playing the dreamyeyed lady marian fitzswalter  the story has heavy romantic overtones  
filmed in the typical  richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor  the flesh tones are overly pink and there few color subtleties  which match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players  
in scene after scene the picture charms the audience  
who wouldnt fall for robin as he shows up incognito to win the archery contest  even if the outcome is so clearly preordained  
and  of course  he doesnt just win  he does so by splitting the other mans arrow  
watching the picture today does provide some jarring moments  
sherlock holmes as the villain  sir guy of gisbourne  for example  just doesnt seem right  even if basil rathbone did have a reallife identity outside of his most famous role  
and then there are those wigs from the makeup department  so bad  they look like rejects from a mel brooks comedy  
as was popular in the cinema of that era  people die with the most gentle prick of the sword and without any nasty  bloody holes to spoil the wardrobe or the looks  
bad guys are banished rather than killed  and lovers go off handinhand  doing nothing more explicitly sexual than kissing  
the result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful  cartoonish figures  
hollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore  so try to savor the old ones when you can  
the adventures of robin hood runs 1  42  
it is not rated  but containing absolutely nothing offensive  it would get a g rating and is fine for all ages  
jeffrey thinks the film is  great  and gives it      
he recommends the movie particularly for people who do not likely bloody pictures  he hates the sight of blood in movies  
his favorite parts are the battles and the ending  and his favorite characters are robin and king richard  ian hunter

0	"you know that a movie has issues when most everyone in the audience comes out laughing    and 
its not a comedy  
and what a strange career path for director chuck russell  
he starts his career off with a decent take on the  nightmare on elm street  series with his debut as director on installment number three  
he follows that up with the blob the very next year  but waits another six years to do his next piece  a little film called the mask starring jim carrey  and then one more star vehicle in eraser two years after that  
so then he thought   let me wait another five years  get a weak script jammed with cliches and hope that jimmy smits and kim basinger could pull it out of its ashes     
strange dude and one crappy flick  
plot  a sixyear old girl is believed to be some kind of mysterious prophet sent down from god  
a satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side  while the girls aunt wants to    well  
save her from those damn devil worshippers  
enter one occult expert agent  plenty of bobo cops and lots of nuns praying  and youve just about got the gist of things here  
critique  with plot holes the size of my ass  this movie barely squeezes any sense out of its clich  ridden plot  with wasted talent  cheezy effects  bad dialogue and unintentional laughs to boot  
whats good about this movie  
well  rufus sewell is pretty fun to watch as the head of a creepy runaway childrens sheltersatanist supreme  with seriously wicked eyes and just enough ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around  
the little girl is also pretty good but unfortunately her character doesnt really do all that much  
and believe it or not  i was actually enjoying some of the films first half hour  which starts off with some promise  but not before bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our protagonist  basinger  just drown the films entire basis of believability  
for some reason  it takes her more time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted  and even longer to figure out that every move that she makes    is 
a dumb one  
add that to the entire police force of incompetents  save for jimmy smits  whose talent agent advised him that playing the exact same cop character from nypd blue would be a good career move  
at least change the clothes  jimmy    zero scares  zero thrills and even less actual drama  and youve got yourself a pretty bad movie  
and why would respected actors like christina ricci and ian holm take bit parts in this movie  
did they owe the director a favor or something  
together  they barely have five minutes of screen time  but i suppose that riccis hospital room scene might be worth a look for some of you horndogs  
the worst part about this movie is its hilariously unbelievable ending  which features police officers coming up with the brilliant idea of  sneaking up  on a mans house  who they know to be guilty of a crime  
uuuhmm    hows 
about knocking on the door and arresting his sorry ass  officers   
anyway  i dont usually inscribe spoilers in my reviews but the stupidity of some of these characters is just too difficult to describe without validating it with solid idiotic proof  and there was plenty to go around   
and did basinger lose some of her acting  talent  during her hiatus from the profession after her 1997 oscar win  
difficult to say if it was her lines that were really bad  or if she just delivered them poorly  
either way  little originality  very obvious computer effects  little thrills  little drama and very little entertainment value  certainly bestow the honor of one of the worst movies of the summer upon this film  
but if you really dont mind a rehashed gobbledygook of various satanic and  kid  based thrillers  and enjoy watching films that dont bring anything new to the table    well  
drink some beers  smoke some beans and rent this video  because it may just be one of the funnier thrillers of the year

1	"plot  a dude and his brother are driving crosscountry and decide to fool around with a trucker on their cb radio  
it isnt long before their little prank gets someone put into a coma  long story  and the next thing you know  the trucker is following them too  
lotsa nuttiness ensues and then  they pick up their other friend  venna  a girl who the dude has a crush on  
but whats this     
the trucker is still on their tail and is now harassing all three of the young whippersnappers     
you bet  
buckle up  dorothy    this is gonna be one bumpy ride  
critique  a good ol time at the movies  
heres a film that actually gives away most of its plotline in its trailer and doesnt really bring anything  new  to the forefront  if youve seen flicks like duel and breakdown  youve crossed this path before   but still manages to entertain you gangbusters  with realistic situations  believable characters  funny moments  thrills  chills  the whole shebang  
lets give it up for director john dahl  who continues to put out solid films every other year  if you havent seen red rock west  do yourself a favor right now  and jot it down on a piece of paper and rent it at your earliest convenience   
and much like that film  this one has an excellent premise and sets everything up at an even pace  
it gives you a little bit of background on each of the main three characters  and then shows you how one small prank  can lead to a whole lotta trouble for everyone  
paul walker really surprised me in this movie  since ive never much thought of him as anything more than a pretty face  and damn  is it ever pretty or what    
but here  he actually manages to put some depth behind the looks and thats always appreciated in films in which you are so closely tied to the main characters  
sobieski is also good  but she isnt in the movie for as long as youd think  but the man who really takes this film to another level  is steve zahn  
if youve loved this guy as the  goofball  in most of his previous roles  youll appreciate him even more here  as the dude who starts off as one of the most manic and excited human beings ive seen in quite some time   this is so awesome      
only to turn into a man scared out of his wits by the end of the flick  
and speaking of the ending  boy  does this movie deliver some chilling moments during its final 15 clicks or what    
the arrow and i were practically in each others arms  well  maybe im exaggerating  but you catch my drift  as each minute brought about another turn of events which in turn  took it all to an even higher level  
once again  kudos to director dahl for being able to generate that type of intensity  suspense and tension  with a great score  editing  style and camerawork  
plotwise  i too did wonder how the  bad guy  was able to track them so well  but it didnt really bother me all that much  you can assume that he had bugged their car    
but pretty much everything else in the story stuck like glue and i couldnt help but put myself in their shoes and appreciate their thoroughly desperate circumstance  
a great movie with an even cooler ending  this film will likely be remembered as one of the better thrillers of the year  
  this is amazing     
wheres joblo coming from  
american psycho  1010   deep blue sea  810   eye of the beholder  410   the fast and the furious  710   final destination  810   the glass house  610   no way out  810

0	"man  this was one wierd movie  
similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldnt decide which genre it is  
the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone  which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship  
the last half hour  
this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided   screw it  lets just kill everybody   
from then on  forget scifi    this 
movie becomes 100 horror  
what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way  
instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare  this movie just uses loud noises  sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore      yawn     everyones 
seen it all before and knows when to expect it  
the one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew  
there are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed  but what did this  
then finally after being painfully restored  the new crew views the video  
the acting isnt too bad at all      considering what the actors had to work with anyway  as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of  
there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though  like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space  
this movie could have been so much better  
it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with  
there was just nothing new here that any of us havent seen before in aliens or hellraiser
