0	how do you judge a film that is so bad  but intentionally so  in spiceworld  the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal  mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film and having a lot of fun doing it  if that was their goal  they did a fantastic job  so is it fair to give it such a low grade when it wasnt really meant to be much better than this  honestly  id rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades  so does that mean i graded it inaccurately  truth be known  i dont really think i can answer this question  to understand spiceworld  you have to understand the spice girls  unless youre very  very  young  or fairly older  you probably have at least heard of them  theyre a group of five busty british babes whove had 1 hit singles and whose debut album sold millions  theyre primarily adored by preteen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spices  real name  geri haliwell  wonderbra  all five of the girls have these  spicy  names for which they are better known than their real names  there is the aforementioned ginger spice  as well as sporty spice  melanie chisholm  or mel c    scary spice  melanie brown  or mel b    baby spice  emma bunton   and posh spice  victoria addams   and all of them  to some degree or another  resemble their stage names  the spice girls took the world by storm  and spiceworld is actually a good humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise to fame  its quite nice to see what good sports the girls are  and not just the one dubbed sporty  about poking fun at themselves  they dont take themselves too seriously  and thats probably the best thing about them  its also surprising how natural they seem in front of the camera  acting   and not just singing and dancing  theyre not flawless by any means  but for the most part  they deliver their lines without feeling staged  and  like them or not  we get the sense the five are very at home within their characters  which seems reasonable since they portray themselves   what makes the film bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls wont get enough of their music  while the rest of us dont get enough of a movie  the real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes  most of the film is very blas   but several parts are downright boring  and then they have those sporadic moments that actually make us laugh out loud  if youre a big fan of the group  you probably wont get enough of what you want  and if youre not a big fan  you get too much time devoted to nothing more than  look at us  moments  for the right crowd  the  music video  sequences will be the highlights of the film  but for others  they will serve as threeminute lulls in a hecticbutoveralluneventful storyline  other key actors include richard e  grant as clifford  the spice girls manager  alan cumming as the filmmaker piers cuthertonsmyth who attempts to make a documentary of the group  george wendt as martin barnfield  a producer who constantly works on pitching a spice girls movie  and roger moore in a small  selfparodizing role  all provide relatively good performances  keeping in mind once again that this film wasnt meant to be acted seriously  even meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver and seems to have fun with it  while this film is continuously compared to the beatles a hard days night  i think that is an unjust comparison  it is supposedly the movie studio that first mad the comparison by way of press kits  but i dont think drector bob spiers  nor the spice girls  intended it to be so  i think the studios were just trying to boost hype and interest in the film  and have instead  come off rather pretentious  i dont think this film is trying to be anything more than a fun  satirical look at a group that got so big  a movie seemed the next likely step  and what couldve been better than a selfindulged yet self mocking approach  probably nothing  and so it is  spiceworld is a movie i thought would be embarrassing to enjoy  but now instead  i find myself wanting to defend a movie i didnt even give a good review  its bad  but it succeeds in every way it intended  it gives the spice girls a chance to play while allowing all those obsessive fans out there to indulge in every brainless moment  perhaps the group is nothing more than a gimmick  if thats the case  the movies gimmick is that it  is  such a gimmick  you might be saying   a spice girls movie  come on    but when it comes down to it  i think thats the point  
0	scream 2  like its predecessor  is a genrecrossing film  it is about 50 horror film and 50 murder mystery  the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time  scream was also known for its selfreferential tone  many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven  again  scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as  sequels suck  and  the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels   scream 2s story is very similar to its predecessors  sidney  neve campbell   having survived the killing spree in scream  is now in college  gale weathers  courteney cox  has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film  called stab  which for all practical purposes is the realworld movie scream   at the premiere of stab  two students from sidneys college are stabbed to death  and a new story begins  the press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer  they want to know all about the links between stab  sidney  and the recent murders  the most complex selfreference i saw  this should be an olympic event  was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference  the rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers  the other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press  the audience was watching the whole  filmed scene    whew   the movie is packed with layers and selfreferences that make it a pleasure to watch  even better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream 2  thats not to say that these references necessarily make scream 2 a deep  or even a good movie  the just add to the fun of watching it  i recommend it for other reasons as well  what i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural  no werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible  it is a person in a mask and a robe  his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims  no extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer  the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies  you have less grounds to say  its just a movie   the whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself  gale weathers and deputy dewey  david arquette  also from the original  track down a killer  they are likeable  but not outstanding  but in combination with the horror aspect  the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint  it was exactly a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream  the internet movie database says that scream 3 is in the works  so i wonder if ill be doing the same thing on january 1  1999  if craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high  ill be happy to mark my calendar

0	ingredients  downonhisluck evangelist  church synopsis  sonny dewey  robert duvall  is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife  farrah fawcett  in bed with another guy  in a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guys head  and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder  and estranged from his wife and two kids  to atone for his sins  sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature   the apostle e  f  as the apostle e  f  sonnys main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station  soon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple  but sonny knows his time is short  one day the police will find him  opinion  this movie is a thoughtprovoking look at an evangelist in real life terms  i believe that robert duvall  who is the producer  director  writer  and main star of the apostle  deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader   a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film  duvalls portrayal of a true believer is authentic  superb  and inspired  it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion  as well as a portrait of a fallible  complicated man driven by his beliefs  incidentally  in real life duvall was just as driven in getting the project underway  since no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist  the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done  paying for its production with his own money  about five million dollars   in terms of hardhitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade  and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film  similarly  those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thoughtprovoking experience  on the other hand  the apostles main strength   duvalls preaching   is also what limits the apostles target audience  in terms of plot and pure entertainment value  the apostle is definitely not for everyone  teenagers  action fans  comedy fans  and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie  since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church  in other words  the apostle is a four star performance  but with a very limited audience

0	some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing  that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies  that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find  to their big surprise  that the majority of people vote republican  go to church every sunday and usually dont tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film  such rude awakening  however  can happen in another direction  conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in  something like that happens to jake van dorn  george c  scott   successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community  one day his daughter kristen  ilah davis  disappears from calvinist youth convention in california  van dorn is worried because he doesnt believe that his daughter would run from home  however  the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast  peter boyle  is even harder  kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film  infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way masts investigation is going  so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself  unfortunately  he lacks experience and the quest  that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld  is fruitless  things change when he devises cunning plan and  while doing it  stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky  season hubley   almost two decades after its release  hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars  it is a real shame  because very few movies in todays hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt  in late 1970s  it was totally different situation  films were expected to have mature  serious themes for the mature audience  for schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work  taxi driver  one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s  on one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great  but that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and  instead of facing them  prefers to live in rural  conservative cocoons  the new america  on the other hand  fares no better  ideals of the socalled  sexual revolution   same as all other  revolutions  of the swinging sixties  degraded into exploitation and depravity  instead of being  liberated   baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms  schrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas  actually  arent so far away  nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn  already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist  meets sleazy porno producer  the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian  paternalistic and very dedicated to this job  the difference between the two is simply in the line of work  many contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda  on the surface  it may look that way  audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest  in the first scenes  he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesnt deserve to experience parents worst nightmare  the scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristens fate is extremely cruel  pain and humiliation  brought by oscarwinning actor george c  scott  is of such intensity  that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda  van dorn is perhaps flawed  and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end  but the viewers simply know that his cause is just  and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body  on the other hand  schrader  who grew up in an environment very much like van dorns  his own parents wouldnt allow him to watch movies until he was 18   knows better and tries to bring another side of coin  even the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities  like nicky  who actually tries to improve her life  and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end  unfortunately  schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning  and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich  d finale  the script is slightly flawed  and schrader as director doesnt show too much originality  his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver  apart from the scenes in grand rapids  those two films even look alike  but the content might be more than interesting for todays viewer  especially those inspired by the current 70s revival  until boogie nights  no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s  hardcore  on the other hand  might serve as precious document  because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs  before the advent of video  when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists  the view of such age and the industry is very unflattering  though  but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience  that shouldnt be too surprising  anyway  despite some flaws  hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema

1	one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel  that concept  although many purists doubt its scientific credentials  spawned many interesting novels  comic books and films in the last century  however  the big granddaddy of time travels  h  g  wells novel the time machine  wasnt written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences  the author  h  g  wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich  idle capitalist class and impoverished labour  whatever intentions wells had  the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages  instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space  the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration  first of them was george pal  who in 1960 directed film which would  through the years  become genre classic of its own  the plot revolves about george  rod taylor   victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension  time  at the eve of the new 20th century  george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention  machine that would enable him to travel through time  they are skeptical  but that doesnt prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future  at first  he travels slowly  seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars  finally  after witnessing world war three  he travels far into the future  hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions  when he finally reaches year 802  701 ad  at first glance  new world looks like utopia  humanity consists of young  beautiful  but idle eloi  people who are fed  clothed and taken care of by unseen machines  but  weena  yvette mimieux   eloi woman  tells george about another side of the coin  in the night  her people is preyed upon by morlocs  humanoid creatures from the underworld  the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature  the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times  for h  g  wells it was frightening threat of class struggle  for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan  who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war  it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust  underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie  even the modern audience  which would be tempted to discard the film as oldfashioned  could find some values in its universal messages  fit for each era  compared with the genre films of today  the time machine is even better  and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent  thoughtprovoking films  of course  since this is hollywood product after all  the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure  sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness  for example  it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future  same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters  while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today  some of the final scenes  that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero  are also rather unconvincing  but  on the other hand  the film is very well directed  cleverly paced and the special effects  although definitely oldfashioned  are more than adequate for this kind of picture  the acting is good  with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles  while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as georges trusted friend filby  yvette mimieux  who plays weena  on the other hand  would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role  however  despite all those flaws  the time machine is a very good piece of cinema  something that connoisseurs of quality sciencefiction films sorely miss these days  
1	oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with  in a perfect world   a civil action  would be a breath of fresh air  its cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isnt  its romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham bookfilm isnt  and  the capper  it has no distinct ending  and the law in hollywood films is that above all else  you must have an ending  even if its based on a true story  a true story which hasnt yet ended  you must supply an ending  a false one  but an ending nevertheless  hell   a civil action  is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together  and that includes  the firm   the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic   yet its also oddly and slightly unsatisfying  weird  this is  in fact  a steve zallian film  not just the work of a hack  and zallian is the director of the muchadmired  search for bobby fischer   didnt see it  and writer of none other than  schindlers list   in short  i like this guy  and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories  after all  apart from the obvious itsaholocaustfilm and itsaspielbergfilm  isnt  schindlers list  just a damn brilliant film  not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study    a civil action  is the same way  its narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study  and its here that the film seems to go a bit wrong  the main complaint of this film is that while  yes  its an engrossing lawyerly tale  it has no real ending  and thats not necessarily the problem with the film  its that its just kind of unsatisfying  if this were a great film  it would feel complete  and still end basically the same way  but this film just seems to end  and i dont want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on  imagine  if you will  being one of those the film is about  looking forward to this film  and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter  just so the many wont bitch about what is  essentially  genuine  but the fact that it just ends is not  in all actuality  what is wrong with it  its rather that zallian has chosen  in the last half hour  to adandon the traditional lawyer story  and chose the other part of his story  the one about the lawyer  one jan schlictman  john travolta   whos shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer  brilliant because hes manipulative and he always wins  it wishes to make it all about jan in the end  but the truth is  his change  although nicely done  is not full  we see him suffering from a personal crisis  and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart  but in the end  we dont fully believe it  and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision  the film choses an odd angle to go at  a noble one  but one that gives the films conclusion that of incompleteness  in the opening of the film  we see him doing his old schtick  manipulating courts  winning cases effortlessly  and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases  in short  hes full of bullshit and we know it  in the film  he takes a case that is hardly desired  a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river  point one  its not of the usual criteria  jan points out  wickedly  that dead or wounded children arent nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success   point two  it has been through several lawyers  after turning them down  jan changes his mind  a muddled scene  he stops his car on a bridge  looks out    is he feeling a sense of overachievement    and he and his team of lawyers  tony shalhoub  zeljko ivanek  and accountant william h  macy  head out to the town to do battle with the towns company  they spend millions of dollars examining the land  test the water  what have you  this is where stephen fry  a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in  wilde   pops up thanklessly   and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children  and then  unsuccessfully  the workers at the plant  they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company  the eccentric jerome facher  played by robert duvall  more on him later on   as we progress  we get so involved in the way the story is being told  which is engulfing everything around it  including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople  one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland  who lost her child  who begins to have a personal crisis   things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half  as they are up against impossible odds  the judge  john lithgow  is not only a strickler  but a pal of facher  the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify  no concrete evidence is being found  depsite the money spent to find it  and they are quickly running out of money  as macy mortgages everything he can  including their homes and their office  he slowly loses his sanity  his meatiest role since  oh   fargo    and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist  in fact  the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par  owen gleiberman  especially  criticized the film for not being overlydramatic    i suppose like a grisham novel   this wouldnt be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is  instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good  hes seen as being still full of bullshit  because he doesnt take stock in the cares of his partners  and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town  he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out  the final half tries to redeem this  as must have been the point of making this in zallians mind  but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs  and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when hes seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him  and thusly receiving two speeding tickets   we still feel that the big change in his life is that hes not rich and esteemed anymore  the films final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow   the fault is not that there is no closure to the court case  its still going on  you know   but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has  we need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life  and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life  it only feels like half of that  maybe even less  and its not travolta  who does a great job here  though never to be a truly memorable performance of his   but rather zallian  whose final chapter needs a rewrite  up to then  though  its an engrossing drama  one of the best of the year in fact  and one of the best lawyer films  period  the reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted  but rather its about the lawyers  the knights who battle eachother  we learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town  but the reason it cant be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find  and duvalls facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that its almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is  facher is seen as an elderly man  a goofy eccentric  carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it  eating lunches out of paper bags  and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio  and scold anyone who interupts him  but look deeper and you see a master at work  his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him  and its difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way  thats why i liked this film  its hard to put a pointer on  you can never see exactly where this film will land  and even when the credits roll  you still arent sure what to make of it  call it the zallian effect  same thing happened with  schindlers list   not that im comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman   each film is so greatly crafted that you cant help but get involved in its broad storytelling  interesting characters  and  most peculiarly  the wit that comes along with it  if only it felt totally complete  like  say   schindlers list   though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two   it might have been one of the best films of the year  and along with that  a full breath of fresh air  
1	billed as a  feminist sex fantasy   this spirited  imaginative and thoroughly engaging film by the awardwinning canadian director cynthia roberts  is destined for extreme reactions  camille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heartfelt tale of the title character bubbles galore  nina hartley   a pornactressturnedpornproducer who faces an uphill battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence  however  those in the andrea dworkin camp  will no doubt loathe the films decidedly proporn stance  political considerations aside  however  this is a delightful lesbian love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers  shauny sexton   in the backdrop  however is bubbles loyal assistant vivian klitorsky  tracy wright  who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss  this femmebutchfemme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity  and  sensuality  in addition to the romantic aspects of the story  bubbles is being stalked and terrorized by her exboyfriend godfrey montana  daniel macivor   a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it  when his plans to sabotage her latest film fall through  he snaps and psychotically decides to kill her  these proceedings are presided over by a most heavenly presence  god herself  yes  in the world of this film  god  is most definitely a  her   and a chorus of undulating  scantilyclad angels  have their most watchful and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold  adding a lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction  this bright  colourful and deliriously sexy film is chockfull of great performances  making her dramatic debut  after appearing in over 300 triple x adult films  porn star nina hartley takes command of her role with considerable assurance and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary straight actresses to shame  hartley has overwhelming star power  and one wonders why other nontriplex producers havent used her bountiful talents  it is also interesting to note that hartley appears in the recent release of  boogie nights   a film which takes a far more traditional doomandgloom approach to the porn industry  making a cameo appearance in the role of god  former porn actress annie sprinkle  a true artist in her own right  gives the entire film an earthy  sensual glow and certainly solidifies and  by her very appearance  downright justifies the themes of the movie  the other performances are equally solid  daniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as the villainous godfrey and tracy wright lends able support with her complex role  shauny sexton  an erotic dancer and pinup model  makes an impressive screen debut  overall  bubbles galore is a film which wears its politics on its sleeve and very proudly indeed  at one point  the title character declares that  instead of trying to save women from the sex trade  we should be working to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for women to work   the direction by cynthia roberts is daring and subversive  roberts is not afraid to plunge the otherwise straightahead and simple narrative into extended and extremely avantgarde montage sequences  the love scenes between the women are especially beautiful  the musical score by nicholas stirling blends cool jazz and lounge stylings  while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend of garish 70s porn and psychedelia  amazingly  this film appears to have received a good deal of its funding from a variety of canadian government cultural agencies  this speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture  as one cannot imagine such an entertaining  original and vital film being made in a traditional setting where conformity and formula rule the day  bubbles galore seems to be making the film festival rounds and does not  at present  appear to have any traditional distribution in place  so keep your eye on the alternative film listings for this one  its funny  sexy and subversive  and it shouldnt be missed

0	every yearevery year at the festival  i wait for that film to come along  that one that just pulls me out of my seat  sticks its face up next to my nose  and roars  surprise   into my bewildered visage  its almost always a surprise  it sure as niflheim was this time  amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale  of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason  and  in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film  it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale  where we roll our eyes occasionally  smirk to ourselves  and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a  boy  i wish that could happen  sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash  another e  t  another short circuit  this film floored me  for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept  the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough  and presents itself well enough  to make it more of an american folk tale  with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time  america has always had its mythical heros  its paul bunyans and john waynes  this film presents us with more general  but still universal  ideals  the honest  innocent children who have their own inner wisdom  the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage  honor  and love for their respective sport  the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding  but has the grit to get things done when they need doin  does the latter sound familiar    amazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters  but it never leaves you with the feeling that its artificial  that it stands behind glass  or that any sharp breezeor  more importantly  sharp thoughtwill shatter the wax facade of the panorama  this is a very sturdy scenario  the principals are always given dialogue  and always give performancesalways  it just blows me away   which made them seem real  yet enforces their particular mythic role  the writerproducer  david field  seems to literally take all the  yeah  but in real life  this would have happen  thoughts you get in your head  sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading  in a stronger way then before  astounding  he uses obstacles to the plot to  enforce  it  i am truly impressed  indeed  envious  with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay  its so very unusual  especially in a hollywood film  i dont want to give too much away  but the basic premise is that chuck  joshua zuehlke   the little league pitcher  decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons  his decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete  a boston basketball player  alex english    amazing  grace smith  and  well  im leaving it at that because i wouldnt spoil this film for you for the world  let me just say this  though  i am not recommending this film because i think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply  i dont give a rats ass for the political pointofview this film expresses  one way or another  im recommending you go see this film because  and only because  its an excellent story  told with excellence  no  i dont believe what happens in this film could happen in real life  while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted  i believe in careful negotiations  mutual verification  etc  screw what i think  the point is  this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movie screen  this is the natural and moreall the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion  and a much better script to boot  it carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhoodand  more importantly  without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of selfconsciousness  special kudos to  both zuehlke  a reallife little league pitcher who was picked for the part  and english  a forward for the denver nuggets  for their seamless personification of their characters  jamie lee curtis  who takes a surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazings manager and friend  william l  peterson  in a  big  change from his role in to live and die in l  a   as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave a flag doing it  and gregory peck  as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was  and who some numbskulls still probably think he is 
0	martin scorseses kundun  which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama  has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure  personally  i dont think it needs one  it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china  scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do  as a largerthanlife symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership  the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences  but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal  the set design and cinematography are outstanding  and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle  it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao  political art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans  kundun does not  it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative

1	have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally  at any given moment  in life  or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world  or outside of it  these thoughtprovoking questions are the subject of  final destination   which is the most riveting horrordrama since 1999s  the sixth sense   stylishly filmed and tautly directed by  xfiles  alum james wong  the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters  in accurately written  teenspeak   rather than overwrought  highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldnt use   all the while developing into a darkly foreboding  severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the lesssuccessful  but still suspenseful epilogue  at the start of the film  17yearold high school senior alex browning  devon sawa  is about to leave with his 40student french class for a field trip to paris  progressively getting a case of preflight jitters  he spots several mysterious  coincidences   including the departure time being 9  25  the same as his september 25 birthday  as well as hearing the john denver song  rocky mountain high  over the sound system in the airport bathroom    john denver died in a plane crash   alex grudgingly mutters to himself  once seated  alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff  and after causing a ruckus onboard  he  as well as six other students and a teacher  are thrown off  arguing in the airport lobby  alexs suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight  killing all 300 passengers  including the rest of their classmates  as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode  the fellow survivors  whom he has saved  treat him in varying manners  carter  kerr smith   the hotshot jock  holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate  alexs best friend  tod  chad e  donella   wants to stand by him but cant because of his fearful parents  the teacher  mrs  lewton  kristen cloke   is frightened by him  believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster  as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker  only outsider clear rivers  ali larter   who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alexs premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before  is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life  that is only the setup of  final destination   and the less said about what follows  the better  suffice to say  the film does  indeed  turn into a slasher film  albeit one that is more thoughtful than most  and replaces a knifewielding maniac for the neverseen granddaddy killer of them all  the grim reaper itself  the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes  and  final destination  surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years  graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner  they manage to occasionally be so intense you dont know whether to shrink down in your seat  tap your feet in nervousness  or turn away  devon sawa  a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999s underseen slashercomedy   idle hands   is even more of a charismatic presence here  the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival  which he comes to believe he wasnt meant to do  as well as the loss of the other passengers  is superbly and subtly acted on his part  one scene  in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful  ali larter  1999s  varsity blues    in the other central role  is also effective  as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before  leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish manthe exact opposite of her nowdeceased father  the other roles are not as fully written  and most remain rather onedimensional  the movie is mainly sawas  however  and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles  tony todd  1992s  candyman    as an arcane morgue attendant  pops up for a fiveminute cameo  but his appearance is rather supererogatory  and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye  while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy  ultimately  what is so good about  final destination  is that  within the confines of the slasher genre  writerdirector wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner  and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frightentwo things that are rarely found in todays horror films  if anything  its safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again  
0	i love this movie  and ive just seen for the umptenth time  unfortunately  it is also completly unknown and very few have seen it  its my mission in life to spread the word  see this movie  fred  george  doug and howie are reaching middleage  three of them have a wife  kids and a house in the suburb with a mortgage to pay  only fred is still a bachelor  together they take the local train every morning to work in town  on one of their organized thursday evenings at a bar  fred tells them of his boss and the arrangements he has made to keep a mistress  he has gotten an apartment in downtown where he can meet her but has told his wife that he needs the apartment to spend the night after staff meetings every thursday night  since they always split everything four ways  they decide that they should get an apartment with a young woman as well  kathy  however  kathy isnt completly honest to them  in fact  she is a sociology student writing a thesis about the sex life of the suburban male  with these four species she believes that she will make a very good paper  ok  have one thing clear though  the romantic rendezvous between kathy and each of the men are completly innocent  the script stays above the waist  or to be precise  above the neck  noboyd claims that kathy is their mistress  the four guys call her their companion  the censorship board here in sweden considered it to be suitable only for people above 15 years  but that only shows how long ago 1962 was  small children could watch this without being corrupted  kim novak is as lovely as always in this movie  even if she seems to be a bit too old for a student  james garner is the playboy just like in many other movies  i liked howard morris the best as howard the accountant who has to diet to support his wife  tony randall is funny as always  1962 was more than 35 years ago  how many accountants  copywriters or investment bankers can today afford to live in a house in the suburb with a lot of kids and a wife who does not work  this is the white middle class  i cant remember that i saw any blacks on the commuter train they use  these are the people who can count on their kids to live an even better life than themselves  perhaps this should also be a subject for a thesis in movie sociology  
1	good films are hard to find these days  great films are beyond rare  proof of life  russell crowes onetwo punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller  is one of those rare gems  a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting  an intelligent script  and masterful directing  together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days  genuine motivation in a story that rings true  consider the strange coincidence of russell crowes character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryans character in the film  all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world  i havent seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpahs masterpiece  the getaway  but enough with the gossip  lets get to the review  the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman  david morse   an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by antigovernment soldiers  upon discovering his identity  the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for 6 million  the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off  and no one will step forward with the money  with no choice available to her  bowmans wife alice  ryan  hires terry thorne  crowe   a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative  to arrange the return of her husband  but when things go wrong  as they always do in these situations  terry and his team  which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year  david caruso  take matters into their own hands  the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent characterdriven vehicle filled with wellwritten dialogue  shades of motivation  and convincing acting by all the actors  the script is based on both a book  the long march to freedom  and a magazine article pertaining to kidnapransom situations  and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy  screenwriter of the devils advocate and dolores claiborne  the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan  but that between crowe and david caruso  dug out from bmovie hell  caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowes right hand gun while providing most of the films humor  ryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes  david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him  and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic  gunslinger character of terry thorne  the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes  the bulk of those scenes  which bookend the movie  work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the storys characters  the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise  director taylor hackford mixes both his oldschool style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film  proof of life is a thinking mans action movie  it is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war  and the sacrifices one makes for those choices  the sacrifices that help you sleep at night  
0	before the remake of psycho appears  weve got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film  dial m for murder  as usual  hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars  and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing  the film opens with emily  paltrow  and david  viggo mortensen  having fun in an loft apartment  the problem is  paltrow is married to stephen  douglas   who is not too happy when he discovers this affair  if i was paltrow  though  id definitely go with mortensen  less wrinkles  anyhow  stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition  hell pay him to kill his lovely wife  mortensen agrees  but the murder goes awry  and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses  unfortunately  the film dosent progress very fast  in fact  it moves like a tortoise with arthritis  read  very  very slow   the plot moves nowhere fast  and only becomes exciting in very short bursts  not too good for a thriller   also  the performances  apart from douglas  are below par  paltrow  showing immense talent in se7en  1995  and sliding doors  1997  is strangely stilted  even unconvincing  in this movie  mortensen is a little bit better  coming across as a younger douglas  but his role isnt meaty enough to show all his talent  which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film  which is does  however  i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking  drinking womanizer with a creepy underside  also popping up in the film is david suchet  playing a shifty looking detective  again  its not a character were seeing on the screen  its david suchet  the director  who bought us the fugitive  piles on all the flash techniques  such as zoomins  quick cuts  etc  the lighting is also interesting  however  looks cant save this film from the depths of mediocre  and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway  the screenplay is o  k  but theres some hackneyed subplot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street  again  and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched  the characters also make incredibly dumb moves  especially paltrow  and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel  with a combination of no tension  drama  or decent characters  a perfect murder is a failure all round  and an incredible disappointment  there are a few bright moments  but they are far and few between  the last thing a thriller should be is boring  and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas  you wouldnt be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect murder  overall rating review by david wilcock  1998   you know  for kids   norville barnes 
0	1992s alien3 marked not only the death  by suicide  of its popular protagonist  ellen ripley  sigourney weaver   but  in many ways  the alien franchise itselfbox office receipts were anemic  thanks to poor audience word of mouth  and the critics who rallied around the first two installments  1979s alien and 1986s aliens  savaged david finchers slog of a sendoff  myself included   hence  weaver  director jeanpierre jeunet  and the others behind alien resurrection faced a twofold challengenot only somehow resurrect ripley  but also rescue this onceprofitable series from the scrap heap  despite the odds  they have succeeded  even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two  writer joss whedon devises a quick  easy  and painless answer to the dead ripley problemclone her  which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161  the prison planet of the third film  that done  the real challenge presents itselfwhat do with her  alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful  aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable  exploring her maternal side  alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death  what could be next  whedon comes up with a clever spin  since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen  the blood used for the clone is also  infected  with alien dna  so the new ripley is  indeed  newa humanalien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength  a psychic bond with the deadly species  and a more predatory attitude  unfortunately  that is where alien resurrections clever streak in writing stops  the alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features  but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought  the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding  but once the creatures break free  it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew  this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers  including tough waif call  played by a game winona ryder  trying to exterminate them  and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential  i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy  while the settling into triedandtrue formula is a little disconcerting  the formula is triedandtrue for a reason  and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon  the alien  after all these years  is still terrifying  and a new breed that is introduced is no less so  the violence is appropriately grisly and extreme  and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting  most notably an extended underwater sequence  the film is absolutely mesmerizing visually  thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji  as technically adept as jeunets direction is  perhaps his  and  for that matter  whedons  greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series  a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for  but the selfawareness of the excess just adds to the fun  no  alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scotts alien or the even greater film that james camerons aliens was  but after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of finchers alien3  jeunets resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild  reckless thrill ride  that is what made the alien series so popular in the first place  and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments  
1	one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction  the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy  innocent fun  sometimes the stories are compelling  sometimes theyre not  but  with the exception of the first film in the series  which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces   ive never been bored by any of the enterprises numerous missions  star trek  insurrection is no exception  the film has gotten some negative reviews  a friend of mine actually thinks its the worst in the series   but im not really sure why  its an exciting  often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film  some say its a bit too light  and more of a long episode than a film  others say the special effects are cheesy and that its boring  i simply enjoyed the film  insurrection  which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast  introduces us to a race of people called the baku  the baku are very old  most of them are about three hundred years old   but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet  of course  these peaceful people cant horde this fountain of youth all for themselves  leave it up to their archenemies  the sona  led by ruafo  f  murray abraham   to mess everything up  the sona  who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable  strike a deal with the federation to move the baku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying  thats when captain picard  patrick stewart  steps in  he realizes that moving the baku would kill them  it also helps that he falls in love with a baku woman  donna murphy    so  with his trusty crew  picard defies the federation to keep the baku in their natural habitat  when dealing with a series with as much history as this  its not entirely necessary to reintroduce your characters with each episode  this is why i believe nonfans have a hard time getting into star trek  in order to enjoy it  one has to understand how to approach it  insurrection  however  does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters  stewart is bold as always  a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together  jonathan frakes  who also directed  is funny as commander riker  a subplot with data  brent spiner  discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting  and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain  overacting like crazy  frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact  insurrection is an exciting film  with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action  this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation  and the result is very pleasing to the eye  particularly in the climactic scenes  in which the sona employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the baku planet  the special effects have a clean  impressively sharp look  if i have any complaint about the film  its that it tries to take a moral stance when its not very appropriate to do so  i dont think its that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 baku in order to save the lives of thousands  better yet  why couldnt they have coexisted  insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience  with its inherent camp factor  the star trek series doesnt seem wellequipped to deal with issues like this  i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle  
1	supposedly based on a true story in which the british drive to build a rail bridge deep in africa grinds to a halt after a pair of lions start killing off the workers in 1898  john patterson  val kilmer   the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation  tried to rid his operation of the lions  but fails  a world renound hunter  remington  michael douglas   is called in and the battle  man against lion  begins  this film has a great soundtrack  and wonderful scenery  the acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin  we only see one side of each character  kilmer is a bridge builder and thats all we see him as  these lions kill dozens of his men and he doesnt even appear to be too upset about it  and the plot  its jaws  but with lions  again were presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should  it appears to kill men because it just likes too  why  who knows  i guess there wouldnt be much of a story if it didnt  the problem is that there isnt much of a story even though it does  
1	the cartoon is way better  thats the bottom line on disneys incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature  the alliance between disney and slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic  home alone  with puppies  and not much else  when production of this remake was announced  the big question seemed to be  why  the original cartoon still works  so whats the point   the answer  it appears  is to give disney an excuse for yet another massive merchandising campaign  the story  for those of you who missed childhood  is simple  two dalmatians  pongo and perdy  fall in love at first sight  they drag their  human pets  together  and in a short time both couples marry  the heavenly matchups turn chaotic when pongo and perdys newborn pups are stolen  their dognapping engineered by the evil cruella devil  who wants them for their pelts  everyone in the animal kingdom then joins in a frantic effort to save the puppies  in the original movie  the animated pooches had a broad range of facial expressions and distinct personalities  we also could hear them talk  which quickly established a crucial element to the charm of the film  the dogs view of humans as their pets  in the new version  the dogs are mute and expressionless  hughes attempts to give them character with repeated shots of the dalmatians draping their heads over each other and licking their faces and necks  while he drew the desired  aww  theyre so cute  reaction from the audience  it was quickly followed by several people whispering  i wonder what kind of food they smeared on the dogs heads to get them licking like that   the canines lack of personality would be easier to take if the human beings had a little  joely richardson and jeff daniels are stunningly bland in their lead roles  in previous films  daniels successfully played off his white bread persona  in  something wild   he revealed the rebellious thrillseeker beneath his neutral demeanor  in  terms of endearment   his hapless appearance masked a cold  manipulative womanizer  here  he and richardson are so consistently bland that its a wonder their images even stick to the film  glenn close  however  has no problems establishing a distinct personality  as the villainous icon cruella devil  she tears up the screen in a deliciously overthetop performance  close matches the intensity of the animated cruella by becoming a cartoon herself  with a twotone fright wig  red gloves with long nails attached to the fingertips  garish animal skin outfits and stiletto heels  close bursts through her scenes like a force of nature  shes clearly having a ball playing this monstrous icon  and her wicked glee is infectious  when she spits out lines like  youve won the battle  but im about to win the wardrobe    the film comes briefly to life    101 dalmatians  is crammed with john hughes typical heavyhanded approach to comedy  after an ingenuous opening showing pongos morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day  the film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on a careening trek through a city park  a little slapstick goes a long way  but hughes just keeps laying it on  the second half of the film  where local animals team up to rescue 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil and her henchmen  is a tedious home alone clone  with the bad guys enduring a variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy  scratchy cartoon  including a thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence    101 dalmatians  has cute puppies and a hoot of a performance from glenn close  but not enough to warrant enduring third rate slapstick  bland characters  and unconvincing animatronic raccoons highfiving one another  rent the cartoon  
0	with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresofts square pictures  final fantasy  inspired by the topselling game franchise  is visually aweinspiring and groundbreaking  no doubt  you have never seen anything like this film  and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved  but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story  wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting  obviously  the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi  everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail  individual threads in the fabric  individual strands of hair swaying  wrinkles and pimples on skin  incredible water effects  overall  the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue  and the times when they dont sync perfectly really stand out  since the animation is usually so dazzling  but you wont spend much time dwelling on those gaffes  as soon as you catch one  the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering   wow     like the series of games  final fantasys plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors  outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind  hironobu sakaguchi  its the year 2065  and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien  phantoms   whenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors  the ofteninvisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul  for some unexplainable reason   while many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein  james woods  to blast the aliens with a  zeus cannon   dr  aki ross  mingna  and dr  sid  donald sutherland  plan to build a  wave  using eight collected  spirits  to counteract the phantoms and kill them off  while the images serve the scifi aspect of the film well  the storytelling doesnt  its unfortunate  because the plot seems so intricately thought out  perhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script  some could blame this weakness on the fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english  except two americans wrote the screenplay  nevertheless  the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes  why do these aliens feed on souls  if they can pass through bodies and ships  how can humans hurt them with guns  what is so special about the  spirits  that they would create a force strong enough to destroy the aliens  worse yet  the dialogue is scripted to be either like a scienceheavy star trek episode  an installment of die hard  or a sappy love story  depending on whos doing the talking  for the most part  its bearable considering the genre  but tedious speeches and cheesy lines dont do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes  the only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming  who always has great cracks during tense moments  but  when the lights come up and the credits roll  youre more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked  theres no question that the roughly 33 million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager to see this movie  and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film  youd be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more  
1	well  heres a distasteful  thoroughly amateurish item that  surprisingly  was actually a boxoffice hit at the time of its release  after just viewing the film for the first time  my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of 35 enjoy this movie  it is cheap  idiotic  unfunny  and not nearly as raunchy as i had heard it was  at least some smut would have livened things up a bit    porkys   tells the story  if you can call it that  of four clueless high school buddies  pee wee  dan monahan   billy  mark herrier   tommy  wyatt knight   and mickey  roger wilson   whom desperately want to get laid  women  for the most part  are a mystery to them  and in this movie  they are to the audience  as well  since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet   their plan is sidetracked  however  when they venture out to a smarmy strip bar named porkys  which they are able to get into using fake ids  after they pay the manager onehundred bucks for three hookers  they are played a trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building  for these four teenage guys  this means war on porkys    porkys   ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level  as a teenage sexromp  it is not wild or amusing enough  as a comedy  all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat  as a look back at the 1950s  it is something  i suspect  most people from that era would want to bury deep in a grave  and as a revenge movie  it is a crushing bore  one of the most offensive things about   porkys   is how jawdroppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers  the four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters  and we learn very little about them  except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in a preschool  that sure is revealing information  the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark  the women are all treated as objects or comedy props  rather than real people  for example  the two gym teachers  mrs  balbricker  nancy parsons  and honeywell  kim cattrall   only have one purpose  and that is to be made fun of  mrs  balbricker is a gruff  noholdsbarred  overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness  and  in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved  honeywell has sex with a coach and barks like a dog  there is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses  even though i have the suspicion they are not   but one thing is for sure  they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny  only humiliating  to prove how outoftouch this socalled comedy is  compare it to other more serious 80s films about teenagers  and it looks even worse in comaprison  any of the john hughes pictures  such as 1984s  sixteen candles   or  1985s  the breakfast club   put   porkys   at an even greater shame  those films actually dealt with serious teen matters  but remained a great deal funnier  thanks to their bright and truthful writing  and heck  if   porkys   wanted to be a teenage sex movie  id take 1982s  fast times at ridgemont high   or 1982s  the last american virgin   over this any day of the week  director bob clark is not a bad director  two years after he made   porkys   he directed the nostalgic holiday classic   a christmas story   i would forgive him for this misfire  in fact  if it wasnt for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay  just the thought that someone would actually sit down to write such a piece of garbage  and think that it was actually a film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world  is actually a whole lot funnier than anything in   porkys   
1	this film is extraordinarily horrendous and im not going to waste any more words on it  
1	  its not good to know too much about someone  charlie   charles warns his niece  charlie  margaret welsh   with a devilish grin  charlie is infatuated with her namesake uncle  her  soul mate  as she calls him since her mother gave her his name  theres a lot to know about charles  not the least of which is that he strangled 3 widows back east  mark harmon  who looks like anything but a killer but specializes in playing them  plays charles  the merry widow murderer in the 1991 hallmark hall of fame remake of the 1943 hitchcock film  shadow of a doubt  and to avoid any questions about his guilt  we see charles in action in the opening scene with his last victim  the story takes place in the early 1950s in the small town of petaluma  california  where charles heads to avoid the police  john gays script uses most of the original screenplay by sally benson  alma reville  and thornton wilder  karen arthurs direction is certainly no match for the great master  but on an absolute scale  the movie maintains a high level of suspense  when supercilious and deceitful charles comes to pay a visit of indeterminate length with his sister and her family in petaluma  they dont know about his nefarious activities  he showers them with elaborate gifts to buy the love they had already given him anyway  two mysterious and exceedingly cleancut writers for a magazine show up to take pictures of the family for a spread on the  average american family   but their interest is focused on uncle charles  especially on taking his picture and learning about his background  charlie  who first welcomed her uncles visit  begins to feel more and more uncomfortable with him and suspicious of the disingenuous magazine reporters  the picture advances with a delicate power using small details such as the newspaper article that the uncle tries secretly to remove and that charlie discovers  the beauty of the story is the pas de deux between uncle and niece as they try to out psych each other  she wants him to leave  and he doesnt want to go  what with a local  rich widow as a prospective victim  will charles kill charlie first  or will she get him out of town  harmon is wonderfully creepy and smug  and welsh is tough but trapped  with a deft touch the director sets up each scene  several with thunderstorms  and tom neuwirths sepiatoned cinematography makes the movie feel as if it were filmed in the 50s  my only quibble is the directors awkward staging of the final scene on the train  is hitchcocks version better  of course  is this one worth watching as well  actually  yes  shadow of a doubt runs 1  40  it is not rated but would be pg for adult themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up  
0	the great actor james woods once said  and im paraphrasing    if sex isnt messy  then youre not doing it right   a truly profound statement  and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre  just replace  sex  with  your mad slasher film    for those uninformed souls  the mad slasher genre  or subgenre  is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline  a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween  urban legend is a mad slasher flick  but one that is so sanitary  bloodless  and nudity free  that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful  though not overly talented  cast  it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special  for film makers  gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale  frightfree horror movie  as stephen king once said  again paraphrasing   if you cant scare your audience  gross em out  if you cant do that  make em laugh   alas  urban legend succeeds only at the latter  though not by intention  i actually find the fact that this film became a minor success  40 million domestic box office gross  more frightening than anything in it  it seems that audiences tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt  the promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills  but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them  unfortunately  these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations  one idiotic superhyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films dont need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering  if anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin  wild wild west  and godzilla  but forget all that  it goes without saying that mad slasher films  or any other exploitation offshoot  will be made without an ounce of craft  especially considering the sheer volume that are produced   allow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film  the lack of enthusiastic exploitation  these flicks arent harnessed with any lofty aspirations  so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time  sadly out of the literally hundreds made  i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while  and urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three  despite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame  it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes  as far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legends setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities  it takes place on a college campus  which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer  you see  the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface  all those young people are growing up together  going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows  so naturally some weirdness is expected  all the better for that elusive crazed killer  coupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around  and the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task  but alas  urban legend is not only idiotic and clich   full  its way too clean  a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity  little gore  and much stupidity  this is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than  i dunno  exercise  its the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a runninglikethewindprey  yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques  its the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack  i really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loudnoisejumpscare thing  yes the audience jumps  momentarily frightened  but wouldnt anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room  i lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer  apparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers  in scream it was a ghost mask  scary enough   in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher mans rain slicker  in the middle of summer no less   and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody  the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood  ooh    scary  intended to conceal hisher identity  for urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume  though i must admit  urban legend does have a winning premise for what could have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film  the films killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends  you know  like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that theyre coming from inside the house   i wont spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used  after all the film does offer fine 2  00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough  sad to say  it doesnt include my favorite urban legend  a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and a very unhappy gerbil  now that would be scary  before i leave you  i would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film  the first being the lack of craft  the second the lack of exploitation   its characters  all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people ive ever spent an evening with  only jared leto  looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day  and alicia witt  as the resilient heroine  avoid vexatiousness  the most annoying of the bunch is a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum  as a supremely irritating lout  so irritating i actually cheered his painful death  and i am not a cruel person   ironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film  if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining  after all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i cant stand getting slaughtered  which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i cant stand not getting slaughtered  
0	its a stupid little movie that trys to be clever and sophisticated  yet trys a bit too hard  with the voices of woody allen  gene hackman  jennifer lopez  sylvester stallone  and sharon stone  this computeranimated yakfest  think toy story 1996 filled with used merchandising  is one for the anteaters  the main story is the independence of a worker named z  allen   he wants more to life than just digging away underground for the colony  when he finds out about insectopia   a mythical place where all insects can run free  z  along with his colonys princess  stone   journey out into the world to find a meaning for life  about 15 minutes into the picture  i began to wonder what the point of the film was  halfway through  i still didnt have an answer  by the end credits  i just gave up and ran out  antz is a mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voiceovers  allen is nonchalant  while i would have guessed  if i hadnt seen her in the mighty and basic instinct  stone cant act  even in a cartoon  this film is one for the bugs  unfunny and extremely dull  hey  a bugs life may have a good time doing antz in  
0	uncompromising french director robert bressons  lancelot of the lake  achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malorys  morte darthur   instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table  it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak  ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous  bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them  chivalry has no place in  lancelot of the lake   except as that of a dying ideal  bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning  decimated  after failing merlins command to retrieve the holy grail  the mystical cup that was filled with christs blood  bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest  bloodshed and failure  the opening sequence is a series of clumsy  disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights  a head is hacked off  a stomach is impaled  a skull is split open  skeletal remains hang from trees  and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house  since the film starts with camelot in nearruin  and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion  it doesnt carry the grand  tragic resonance of other arthurian films  we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power  therefore there is no real downfall to witness  but  then again  it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film  rather  it is lancelot  and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart  than the external downfall of a kingdom  lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales  and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh  the greatest of all knights  he was flawed only in his love for arthurs wife  queen guinevere  and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot  even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere  laura duke condominas   he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment  he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom  but he is powerless in his passion  when sir mordred  patrick bernhard  accuses lancelot of the affair  other knights  including sir gawain  humbert balsan  spring to lancelots defense  it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table  the flesh wins out over the spirit  and the consequences are dire  bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of mens hearts and minds    lancelot of the lake  is filled with his particular trademarks  a strippeddown  minimalist style  flat  expressionless dialogue  and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music  he uses background music only twice in the film  during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits  the music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes  but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the films thematic elements  the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor  the neighing of horses  the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads  and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest  like most of his other films  bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless  flat voices  all the actors he used in  lancelot of the lake  had never acted before  and with the exception of patrick bernhard  they never acted again  never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word  instead of using vocal inflection  bresson strove to create emotion through images  in some ways  this technique works  in other ways  it doesnt  the final montage of arthurs men battling each other is quite marvelous  and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrappile sums up the entire film in one moment  however  other times bressons uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable  for instance  during an important jousting contest  bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses legs  he does this repeatedly  opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag  while there might be symbolic value in this  the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome  nevertheless   lancelot of the lake  is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker  bressons style may not be for everyone  but one has to respect his strength as an artist  by reevaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own  he turns  lancelot of the lake  into something rare in modern cinema  a truly personal film  
1	8mm  written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker  has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery  nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles  who is asked by upper class toff mrs  christian  myra carter  to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe  the movie happens to be an mythical snuff movie  where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed  all mrs  christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not  welles agrees  and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies  with video clerk max california  phoenix  as his guide  although the snuff industry hasnt really been examined in mainstream cinema  8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most  the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing  although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away  8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much  and apart from a few moments  most of the action in the film is nothing you havent seen from another standard thriller  the cast help towards the entertainment  apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage  while he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona  1987   ever since leaving las vegas  1995   cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot  such as in the terrible snake eyes  1998   here  in 8mm  hes boring  uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice  and in this overlong thriller  these virtues do not help keep the suspense up  only when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving  as phoenix is a true talent  his performance is a great break away from the gloom  and hes just purely enjoyable to watch  catherine keener is completely wasted as cages wife  although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves  her character  though  is hugely underwritten  one of the most wasted characters of the year  also fun is fargos peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director  as this film is written by the person behind seven  8mm is filled with doom and gloom  and noone appears to know how to use an light switch  unlike seven  8mm isnt too clever  and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives  lacking the strong characters seven featured  8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise  and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment  but director joel schumacher  the completely wrong guy for the job  puts style over content  and while the direction and look are good  its just not very disturbing  schumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience  and though we are meant to be looking at the dark belly of the porn industry  it doesnt exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind  which misses the point  also  the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed  so cliched  its amazing to think its the same film youre watching  8mm is far from an success  a snuffed opportunity  with a boring lead character  controversial scenes that manage not to be controversial  and a director obsessed with looks  what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller  ultimately  8mm is probably worth renting on home video  unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like  and trust me  the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it  
1	when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions  i turned to my friend and said   dangerous liaisons for kids   it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense  owing everything it is to stephen frears 1988 masterpiece  imagine my surprise to see that writerdirector roger kumble has given credit to his source material  choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits  and i was impressed  in fact  i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film  which is an appalling excuse for a movie  its kiddieporn hackwork  complete with earthy sextalk and fullyclothed handjobs  i suppose this kind of movie was inevitable  with all the teen highschool angst movies coming out  there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think theyre smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined  cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way  and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to  i hated all the characters  and i hate everything they do  i also hate ryan phillippe  so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be  phillippe plays  check out this name  sebastian valmont  wow  isnt that a memorable name  i could just say it over and over again  sebastian valmont  it kind of rolls off the tongue  in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich  sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth  there is no woman he cant have  no material object out of his reach  he has all the money  all the sex  all at his fingertips  and  luckily  his parents never enter into his life  no  in the world of cruel intentions  adults dont really exist  the ones who do are irritating  sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister  kathryn merteuil  sarah michelle gellar   the bitchqueen of the universe  and also the woman every man wants  since these two rich kids are so bored  they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons  kathryn wants sebastian valmont to devirginize cecile caldwell  selma blair   a naive dorkchick who has somehow wronged kathryn  but its too easy for sebastian valmont  he wants to nail annette hargrove  reese witherspoon   the  paradigm of chastity and beauty   so  sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal  which is too explicit to state here   but  dear god   sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove  dangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable  and because of its masterful acting  cruel intentions is bad for many reasons  but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting  kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch  a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her  she is supposed to be mean  but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons  gellar  while aesthetically pleasing  is onedimensional and utterly repulsive  witherspoon has a truly beautiful face  but her character isnt the moral staple shes supposed to be  sure  she wont have sex until shes in love  is this really a  moral  issue    but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible  but i cant forget mr  phillippe  who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable  invulnerable blandness  i have to give him credit and say that he did  in fact  manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions  and theres one point in the film in which he shouts  thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone  true  he is bad  but it doesnt help that he has no character to work with  kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character  leaving us with a sexcrazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch  the film fails in every other way  too  first of all  nobody talks like this  even the  intellectuals  i know dont bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering  for a while  the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs  but it ends up taking itself so seriously that theres no way we can join it  cruel intentions also manages to come off as softporn in more than one scene  earlier i mentioned a fullyclothed handjob  this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont  both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie  so  if we hate them  then whats the point of an extended sex scene  titillation  of course  it cant even work under the pretense of  meaningful love scene   because we hate the characters  its interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons  kumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film  many of the scenes have a similar tone  and there are moments in frears film that kumble imitates almost completely  such as the last scene  in which spoiler warning   the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers   but kids dont act like this  nobody acts like this  in his translation  roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy  some pretty crucial elements  the result is a picture of confounding badness  a kiddieporn mess that thinks its really deep and profound  ill give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences  but that doesnt change the fact that its awful  
0	the generals daughter is a heartless  absurd film  a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters  director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with hamhanded obscenity  creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudodepth  whats worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic  the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm  john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess  playing warrant officer paul brenner  brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell  leslie stefanson   daughter of general joe campbell  james cromwell   brenner is teamed up with exspouse sarah sunderland  madeline stowe   and they check out all the suspects on the base  including elizabeths mentor  colonel moore  james woods   soon  it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff  but the question comes down to why  and  of course  who  eberts law of the economy of characters can be applied here  one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point  including the two protagonists   but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story  perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that  but its painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something  on a story level  the generals daughter is ineptly constructed  the film  adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demilles novel  which was apparently based on a true story   plods along to its conclusion  filling in the blanks with stale  unrealistic dialogue and  shocking  plot developments  having not read the novel  its difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author  but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree  scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity  minutes after finding the dead young woman  brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue  which includes endless strings of forced lines    sunderland actually asks brenner   why was she killed   to which i would have answered   if i knew  then the movie would already be over    only after weve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together  this angle  though apparently present to develop their characters  is never explored  not that it really matters  since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot  in one scene  sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask  she sees one of his rings  and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring  instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect  they take him to brenners houseboat  beat him up  and pour hot coffee in his lap  this scene really pushed me over the edge  not because its gratuitous and meanspirited  but because it illustrates the films complete disregard for the characters and the audience  it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene  mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise  i realized that these constructs on screen arent actually characters  but devices present only to serve the story  this would have been bad enough without the wests need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct  compelling films about sexual crimes dont spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks  and they certainly dont show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture  these scenes are not the least bit powerful  on the contrary  theyre intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain  whomever that may turn out to be  in addition  the movie treats sexual fetishes  and sadomasochism in particular  as if its a perversion of everything we know to be pure  this standpoint is certainly allowed  but only in accompaniment with welldeveloped themes to back it up  as it is  the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes  and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane  perhaps the only positive elements in the generals daughter are a couple of the performances  james woods has a few terrific scenes  and plays his role with sharp  witty subtlety  i also liked james cromwell  mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous  nonetheless  these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary  obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization  the generals daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film  it pretends to have a soul  to be of strict moral code  when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cutouts forcefeeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and onesided moral judgments

0	damn those trailers  had it not been for the advertising of this film  which reveals far too much about its contents  i would have been glued to under the sand  as it is  the film retains some value  thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling  and a more mature francois ozon in the directors chair  marie  charlotte rampling  and her husband jean  bruno cremer  lounge on the beach  she takes a nap while he goes for a swim  when marie wakes up  jean is nowhere to be found  she contacts authorities  but they cant find him either  did he disappear to start a new life  was he killed by accident  did he commit suicide  marie still asks herself these questions a year later  and in order to move on with her life  she must find some answers  its a fine premise  and this little movie uses it to the limit  the film moves at a leisurely pace  a bit slow  but relaxing  its a very visual story  and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles  this is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie  who shot the film in a dreamy haze  and the lead performance by rampling  rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie  you connect with her character instantly  despite that shes delusional  the scenes where she interacts with her husband  who she still believes is alive  are heartbreaking  she cant quite get over him  theyve been married for twentyfive years  the other actors  particularly jacques nolot  are excellent too  the sex in the film is rather unneeded  but compared to ozons criminal lovers  its the disney channel  likely to cause some discussion afterwards  under the sand is a fine movie going experience  while its hard to recommend as entertainment  its a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss  ozon seems to ask what you would do  and thats certainly a hard question to answer  
1	who would have thought  jim carrey does drama  when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show  i thought   what a hilarious idea for a movie   however  it was an even better premise for a drama  the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man  that man is truman burbank  jim carrey   truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly  cristof wants to keep it that way  christof is the  god  of this madeup world  he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles  there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world  but they failed and life went on as normal  the opening parts of the film introduce to trumans world  we see what he is doing at his current age  then we get a flashback at his past  it may seem a tad boring  but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start  the film can be described in one word  weird  it seems like such a simple idea  yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of  but andrew niccol did  it seems like a warped idea  but it is andrews idea and he did wonders with it  jim carrey actually lived up to the hype  the hype  whether good or bad  always focused on carreys ability to do drama  no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be  the only thing they doubted was carrey  and he showed them all up  jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars  i do not think he was the best actor  but he deserved the nomination  he plays truman burbank  the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world  he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years  but then strange things start happening  he ventures into the wrong elevator  a light crashes in front of him  his father comes back and is then pulled away  we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show  but truman does not  and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish  carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama  laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife  she plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point  peter weir does not make the cast perfect  and their flaws eventually lead to trumans escape  the story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down  despite carreys greatness  the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris  who plays the  god  of trumans world  he displays the pressure he is under  the world he has created  he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life  the action moves at a good pace  and rarely gets sluggish  but  the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show  it really makes you think  maybe your brother is an actor  maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show  some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking  or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for trumans arrival  and when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon  noah emmerich  delivers his dramatic line  all of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative  i was not only enjoying the film  i was overwhelmed by genius of it  overall  the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood  jim carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million faces  but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best  andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection  the truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film

1	as any sociologist will attest  your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult  parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives  but if your upbringing is marred with violence  hate and dysfunctionality  then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome  affliction explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood  the man in question is wade whitehouse  nick nolte   here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface  he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me  but as you scratch beneath the surface  something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head  we see that he is a meantempered person  he has a hard time taking control of his emotions  which usually gets the better of him  he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person  but something is sparking a tendency towards violence  he also has tremendous problems with relationships  he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter  but his bearish persona and stature alienates her  he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him  his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl  sissy spacek  at risk  she tries to remain true to him and supportive  but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person  relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point  finally  he is spiteful and vindictive  as a rejected father  he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless  as the towns only police officer  he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died  we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain  he is a prisoner and a slave to it  he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension  what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him  we learn that the answer is his father  james coburn   this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet  he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist  we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks  to heighten the fathers churlishness  the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person  very effective  today  wades dad is quite elderly  but still manages to instill fear into a grown man  the influence that the father possesses is inescapable  and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade  the result is every sons nightmare  becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be  this is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama  and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity  hes a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father  coburn displays heft as the bitter dad  but  its most certainly not saturdaynightfriendly fare  theres nothing light or fluffy about this film  that may turn many moviegoers away  but its certainly worth noting that this is a wellacted drama showcasing noltes and coburns raw acting talents

0	the 13th warrior reeks so badly of melodrama and poor acting that it carries a worst scent than a canines least appetizing residue  the best part of the film would be a close contest between the closing credits and a brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely white and you hope that the film has slipped and caught ablaze in the projector  my vote goes for the ending credits  where you can start trying to put the awful experience behind you  ibn fahdlan  antonio banderas  is an important official who is banished from his home for sleeping with another mans wife  he encounters a group of norse warriors who convince him to join them on a mysterious journey to be taken by 13 men  fahdlan is chosen as the 13th and last warrior in a moment that is so desperately overacted and overdone that numerous persons at the screening i attended broke out into laughter  the movie proves to be a new low point for banderas  whos acting seems closer to that of his role as the lover and caretaker for a dying gay man in 1993s philadelphia  than that of a warrior  in the films supposed pay off scene  he exclaims  i was wrong  these are not men    a line intended to be the most memorable quote of the production  unfortunately  banderas delivers it in a fashion that makes chevy chases career look like oscar material  the film  based on michael crichtons best selling novel  eaters of the dead was shot under that name some three years ago  and after numerous rewrites not only does the dialogue seem completely phony  but the plot is incredibly difficult to follow  at the same time  the 13th warrior makes you think about numerous questions  questions like  why do the characters always have perfect lighting on them even when it is pitch dark      why does no one ever have blood cover both sides of their face  but rather just one side   and finally   will the manager give me a refund   90 minutes into the 103 minute film  a man invites of the warriors  come with me  there is a woman who can help   unfortunately  there is nothing that could help this film  the most appropriate ending would have been for the 13 men to join hands  form a chorus line  and break into a rendition of  springtime for hitler

1	ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film  i have a problem even regarding it as a film  its more of a show  a big commercial for ted turners world championship wrestling  wcw   the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page  goldberg  and sting  the story is very minimal and basic  there are these two guys  gordy  david arquette  and sean  scott caan   they are two twentysomething wrestling fans from wyoming  when they go to a live event for the big match up  there favorite wrestler jimmy king  oliver platt  is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus  joe pantoliano   gordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus plans  on the way  they meet some people  have some fun  and clean up some portopotties  sounds great huh  well its not  the movie makes many attempts at humor  only a few of them work  the jokes that make you laugh  however  do not outnumber the films many duds  there is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa  the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back  i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquettes tag team partner is macho man randy savage  they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor  the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan  mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl  the cheerleaders of the wcw  she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice  funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowans breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face  now what didnt work in this movie  that would be the rest of it  the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets  the two lead characters work for a portopotty cleaning company and when they crash the truck  the excrements spill all over the road  its not funny  its pathetic and brainless  the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way  i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie  the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle  like that would happen to any fan  especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set  also  i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily  they just walked right in  i like wrestling  i watch it at home and laugh  its continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldnt watch it  this movie wasnt even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv  the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew  the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently  the movie was too dimwitted to be funny  it is possibly the most useless and underdeveloped film ever  a recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film  detroit rock city  that movie was interesting  well done and continuously funny unlike this film  the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh  now that the scream trilogy is over  arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1800callatt ads  at least he has a hot wife in courtney cox  hes in the funny parts of the film but there arent enough to make him look good  the music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rocks  bawitdaba  and  cowboy   martin landau has a great cameo as a classic  hardnosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne  script is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin  a fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it  at times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real  the wrestlers form alliances  go to peoples houses and beat them up  its utterly ridiculous  the whole film was a wasteful  dumfounding experience  the movie was made to pay homage to the fans  telling them things that made wrestling  not the wrestlers  the wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a pottyhumor movie  the wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic twohour commercial to watch it  if youre going to watch wrestling watch wwf  its actually entertaining  the wrestling is betters  theyre funnier  more diverse  and have better entrance themes  oh and the girls are hotter  is this what movies have become  2 hourlong commercials that you have to pay to see  dont waste your money  
0	the last of vampirefilms offers plenty of blood and gore  but beyond that  nothing  jack crow  james woods  is a professional vampire slayer that is secretly working for the vatican  his and his mens mission is to clean the earth from vampires  they have lost count of how many vampires they have slaughtered  but one has always escaped them  valek  thomas ian griffith   the dark messias and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself  for all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation  the black cross  with the cross in their possesion  the vampires will be able to walk in the sunlight  after that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth    i have never liked john carpenter and his style  after seeing this film  my opinions have not changed  john carpenter remains john carpenter  however  because of the films selfirony  black humour and fascinating cinematography  i would say that it is his greatest achievement in a long  long time  neither the synopses or carpenters direction are original  but there are some things that are interesting  the directors negative view on the catholic church  for instance  at the end of the film it becomes clear that cardinal alba  maximilian schell  has simply used crow and his team to find valek  so that he would gain eternal life  otherwise the catholic priests are shown cool  drinking  smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy  carpenter has created an interesting atmosphere  set in new mexican dessert  he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns  symbolically illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness  more than anything in this film  this simple illustration shows the battle between good and evil  the cinematography by gary b  kibbe is probably the films greatest achievement  music  composed by john carpenter himself  is at times effective  the special effects and makeup are likewise worth a notice  when it comes to the cast  in an intellectual film like this casting is the last problem  everyone can scream and swing the axe    but here james woods is suprisingly convincing  he is macho and cool as the dedicated hunter  who lost his family to the  breed of evil   woods is constantly overacting  which really saves the film from falling into the trap of serious self importance  daniel baldwin is also entertaining as crows loyal partner  the other cast members are struggling  because the film doesnt take itself too seriously  it stays afloat  still it is like most vampirefilms  a mediocre experience  
1	as you should know  this summer has been less than memorable  with a total of 4 decent films  its not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing  with that said  you can pretty much predict what my opinion on  the 13th warrior  will be  the film is based on the michael crichton  eaters of the dead   in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king  after tarveling for many months  he comes across a gang of norsemen  who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog  so  they start picking men  and are left without 1  thus ahmed is choosen  so far it sounds interesting right  not when all of this takes place in 15 minutes  after that  they basically run around killing  that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film  because once your story is introduced  you have the rest of the film to start developing it  obviously thats not the case here  even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure  you will be disappointed  since all the action takes place in fog  it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances  and to poor camera work  cant the camera men sit still  id like to actually watch a film in focus  but again  they failed to deliver that as well  the film moves on and on until the point  where you can care less about anything but the popcorn youre eating  with corny dialogue  that the characters laugh at for some odd reason  a script that goes nowhere  dull action sequences  a predictable ending  and worst of all weak characters  theres basically nothing to like here  except for maybe the set designs  thats the only thing that honestly caught my interest  when i heard that john mctiernan  the director  wanted his name kept out of the project  that made me wonder why  well now i know  crichtons greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product  which led to a big arguement  whats there to argue about anyway  the film couldnt be saved  no matter how much they spent or casted  seeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money  i wouldnt be surprised to see  the 13th warrior  become a hit  please do me a favor and save your money at all costs  or else you will be lost in the fog  like the film itself  
1	a life less ordinary  r  while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title  a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided  for this confused  confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle  producer andrew macdonald  and screenwriter john hodge  at the core of this strange film is a fairly basicand  yes  ordinarypremise  after robert  boyle regular ewan mcgregor   an aspiring writer of trashy novels  is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation  he kidnaps navilles  ian holm  spoiled daughter celine  cameron diaz  and holds her for ransom  the joke here is that celine is a willing victimher father threatened to cut her off financially  so she wants revengeand that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme  teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping    and  ultimately  didnt we see this one coming    love  so far  so mediocre  but mediocre is better than dreadful  which this film is  thanks in no small part to the hodges contextual frame for the romance  it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth  so the chief of heavens police  gabriel  dan hedaya  dispatches two angels  oreilly  holly hunter  and jackson  delroy lindo   to earth to hook up celine and robertor lose their angel status  this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture  but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film  as it stands  it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand  not that there is much of a romance to begin with  try as diaz and mcgregor may  celine and robert are too onenote to become very endearing characters  celine is rich bitch  robert is a dullard  as such  it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these twothen again  they never seem to really connect with each other  when celine and robert start to overtly act on their  feelings   it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural  but i am not exactly sure if boyle and companys point was romance  honestly  i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish  boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz  but it remains just thatenergy  not energy in service of a story or even acting  the cast seems lost  especially hunter  whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling  and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film  some violent confrontations involving the angels  who are not exactly angelicin fact  they end up staging their own ransom scheme  some mystical hokum in the climax  and a cutesy claymation epilogue  watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell  stockpiling quirks in the name of cool  instead  the film just gives quirky a bad name  my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic  yes  misspelling intended  whimsy  which comes through in only one scene  an extended musical number where celine and robert sing  beyond the sea  at a karaoke bar  after a verse or two  the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos  and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter  the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard  just relying on the innate charm of the leads  allowing them to build a romantic rapport  alas  not nearly enough is built  for this moment comes to an abrupt end  i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses  but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill  a life less ordinary certainly delivers something  different   but by the time the film was over  i was clamoring for a life more ordinary    i can accept failure  everyone fails at something  but i cant accept not trying  it doesnt matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart   michael jordan 
1	  spawn  may be somewhat of an older film  in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasnt seen it will finally get to see it  that is  if they see it   but i managed to catch it before it made its way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and  god forbid  video cassette purchasing  it wasnt the worst film of year by any means  it isnt even on the top 5 of the worst films of the year  but it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten  which  in simpler terms  means it comes in at number 6 on my  worst of 1997  list  the only reason it doesnt come in lower is thanks to the special effects  which might actually have been some of the best of the year  performances  however  were either wooden or  for the most part  unforgivingly campy  in fact  this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness  even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality  i dont know how to explain that one  it wasnt exactly choppy  but something about it seemed      well  annoyingly unprofessional  john leguizamo almost makes it as clown  but not quite  he is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional  but the main problem i found with  spawn   as with most films that wind up on my  worst of  lists  is that it was just plain boring  i wouldnt even say there was a climax to the film  sure  it had the big battle scene at the end  but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a conclusion  never too soon  the movie did conclude in a very simple  disappointing way  even though its one of the shorter movies ive seen this year  its one that i would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again  like i said  the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride  no matter how small  i was impressed with the opening sequence  so long as i didnt allow the melodramatic voiceover and lobotomizing editing to get to me  and batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawns outfit created  but even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes  which looked quite a bit like a modern video game  who knows if  spawn  the video game  wasnt part of the plan from the beginning  keeping in mind that the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat more approachable  and in a very small amount  makes up for the cheeziness of it all  but none of this movies saving graces can it make it something id recommend seeing  no matter what the price of admission  this movie is definitely not for young children  which shouldnt really be a problem seeing as how only teenagers  if anyone  would likely find it appealing  if you really want to catch a movie  there are many better ones out there  no matter what your tastes might be  trust me    spawn  has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers  
0	in the mid1980s  following the splendid debut in hugh hudsons greystoke and relative success of first highlander film  it looked like christopher lamberts acting career might go somewhere  but  it wasnt meant to be  which became obvious following highlander ii  in this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality  very often such films were science fiction  which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert  whether it was because of real lack of talent  terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isnt important  the end result was almost always horrible  the same can be said for fortress  1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon  director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond  the movie is set in 2018  for some undisclosed reason  usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child  jake  christopher lambert  and karen brennick  lori laughlin  broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border  sentenced to 31 years in prison  they are both thrown into fortress  privately owned correctional facility  equiped with stateoftheart futuristic technology and run by computer called zed  although equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates lives and make any escape impossible  prison authorities often use violence  jake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape  such escape should become necessity  because the warden poe  kurtwood smith  begins showing unhealthy interest in karen  after rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison  this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity  the reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich  s and situations that are painfully predictable  by the time brennick begins his escape from fortress  those situations not only begin to look predictable  but utterly implausible too  of course  film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultraexpensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society  the initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters  played by not too interested or talented actors  lori laughlin  although physically attractive  shows the acting ability of sequoia  kurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired  capable of solid  yet forgettable performance  lamberts performance is also good  but even the bigger talent couldnt help this film  destined to end in oblivion  
1	keep cool  a chinese film directed by semiaccomplished filmmaker yimou zhang  was one of the kickoff films for this years hawaii international film festival  on the day it premiered  lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block  some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater  they need not have wasted their time  the movie is billed as a comedy  but is surprisingly bereft of humor  there are noticeable attempts at laughs  but very few tries actually click  i wondered if there were jokes that i wasnt getting because im not from china  but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldnt be attributed to the cultural barrier either  keep cool just isnt very funny  the prelude to the film was a visit by keep cools producer who  with the help of an interpreter  regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time  an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii  although the print made it  the assistants luggage was lost  too bad that story wasnt in the movie  because it got a big laugh  qu ying  the films female lead  was also on hand to give a few comments  however  whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed  ms  ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one  fastpaced  incredibly long tirade  it was dizzying  good foreshadowing for the film  you see  keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes  at least thats the way it seems  since the camera is constantly moving  cinema verite is one thing  but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another  although some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing  i found it thoroughly distracting  and after a while  quite annoying  headache  as i said  the film is about a young bookseller  wen jiang  who is after a young woman  qu ying   they used to be romantically involved  but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship  the first half of the film is about the young mans plan to win her back  of course the thing is  she doesnt want to be won back  and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit  in the fight  the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker  but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost  we later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced  there is a funny scene  the only one in the film  where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner  baotian li  in order to recoup his losses  there is no sense to be made out of the young womans behavior  cold one minute  caring the next  so we feel no sympathy for her character  the bookseller would be better off without her  although the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well  who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owners hand as revenge for the beating he took  it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man  while the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge  the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation  his quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with  but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time  a friendship develops between the two men  but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate  although only an hour and a half in length  keep cool contains extraneous material  the whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out  since we dont see her from the midpoint on  a case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner  and would have saved us from the booksellers boring pursuit during the first half  but of course  this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour  there are a few things that keep cool does right  as mentioned before  the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good  although it grows tiresome  the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic  and represents the differences in thinking between generations  in one scene  for example  the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across  but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted  and that it means something entirely different  also effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene  such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner  the nightclub owner is counting out money  slapping each bundle of currency on the table  with every shot of his hand  we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge  unfortunately  these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the films shortcomings  and werent enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater  
1	to me  nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film  despite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed  the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence  ever since the big success of the actionthriller faceoff in 1997  the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr  cage  the perpetually awful assassination thriller snake eyes was one of 1998s worst films  8mm was a disappointing lost cause  but who better than scorsese to match cages wit and intensity  which he does in miraculous fashion with bringing out the dead  cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce  a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from daytoday  after five years of the stressinducing job  frank basically just staggers onward  relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends  he also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care  namely a young girl named rose  who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york  frank desperately wants to be fired  but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need  ill fire you tomorrow     he promises   frank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance  the first is larry  john goodman   who always has food on the brain  the second is marcus  ving rhames   a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescue operation  and finally  tom  tom sizemore  is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood  i found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank  but they never figured into the actual plot  each is merely a colorful presence to help develop franks character  because bringing out the dead is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality  the one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary  patricia arquette   the daughter of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack  arquette  who recently received the wounds of christ in stigmata  performs well around reallife husband cage  its unfortunate that  after such intriguing character trials and tribulations  the relationship between frank and mary slips during a mishandled  ineffective finale  the movie belongs to the onetwo punch of cage and scorsese  who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to bringing out the dead  although it certainly lacks the grit and hardedge of something like goodfellas  scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture  the incredible camerawork and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration  fans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive  darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997s kundun  does bringing out the dead rival scorseses finest work  only occasionally  some of the film feels surprisingly limp  but there is enough energy in its interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice  those expecting a grisly  risqu  product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straightarrow approach  but its still a solid  admirable effort  bringing out the dead was written by the acclaimed paul schrader  who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as taxi driver and raging bull  schraders script is full of moments  wonderful  sharply defined moments  that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay  the exceptional aspects of the film are its astounding technical credits and the amazing cast  goodman and sizemore are both electric  well  mainly sizemore   but its the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look  watch the actors deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects a gothic band member  and youll understand why he won a golden globe  bringing out the dead is raw and electrifying often enough to mask its certain flaws  scorsese  and cage  for that matter  have done better  but their intentions are certainly admirable

1	carolco pictures and dutch director paul verhoeven  robocop  came together to create the 1990 mega hit that is total recall  the film is a masterpiece of sets  action  and special effects  action and science fiction just dont get any better than this  the story involves a construction worker named douglas quaid  arnold schwarzenegger  who lives on earth with his beautiful wife lori  sharon stone   quaid is obsessed with mars and decides to go with the second best choice  a brain implant  fake memory  of a two week vacation on mars  while being implanted a memory cap is triggered and the doctors realize that quaids memory has previously been erased  now the people who did it are after him  quaid must find out who he really is and why these people want him dead  the plot unfolds at a rapid pace explaining itself through great action  special effects  and twist after mindboggling twist  it grabs you and never lets go  this film is a winner from beginning to end  the plot is superb  combining the best elements of science fiction and psychological mystery to create a riproaring saga  schwarzenegger gives his best performance ever  and the supporting cast is good too  the action and stunts are terrific  the sets are huge and elaborate with a lot of attention payed to detail  the music and sound effects are perfect for the film and really add a certain level of impact to the action  the makeup effects by rob bottin  the howling  the thing  and robocop  are top notch  not to mention extremely outlandish  the visual effects by dream quest  the abyss  and industrial light and magic  star wars trilogy  jurassic park  and terminator 2  are phenomenal  the visuals had such a state of the art  slickness  that they won an oscar  of course the film isnt always realistic  its more fiction than science  for example  it is true that a body wont explode in the vacuum of space but in total recall they do  who cares  its a movie  movies are supposed to entertain  and in my opinion this film achieves an entertainment level in film that is so terrific  it may be impossible to beat  
1	making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed  especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece  when it comes to living up to expectations  a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure  for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the originals greatness is very rare indeed  and whereas  babe  pig in the city  misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe  it is a worthy companion piece  more than that  it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right    babe  pig in the city  warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like  the godfather  part ii  and  the empire strikes back  as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced    babe  pig in the city  picks up precisely where  babe  left off  having won the sheep herding competition  farmer hoggett  james cromwell  and his pig are elevated to fame status  a series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs  hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city  in doing so  the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original    babe  pig in the city  flourishes where so many sequels fail  most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film  not  babe  pig in the city   this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first  also  by not being content to utilize most of the old characters  this film gives us many new ones to enjoy  in essence  it doesnt attempt to copy itself  instead  it strives to achieve an originality of its own  and it succeeds  thats not to say the familiar is absent    babe  pig in the city  retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film  along with babe himself  ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride  as does mrs  hoggett  one of this decades best and most underappreciated comic characterizations  hilariously performed by magda szubanski   the three singing mice also make the journey  chiming in with their cute highpitched vocals  the story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice  from there  we are guided once again by roscoe lee brownes soothingly deep narrative  composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these  but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting  while staying at the flealands hotel  babe encounters a veritable arkfull of new animals  monkeys  kittens  and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new  urbanites  that babe befriends  as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter  each character is distinctly unique  some of which are imbued with personal humanlike struggles that are endearing and touching  and while this world focuses largely on these animals  we are introduced to two new human characters as well  mary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel  an animalloving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors  steins landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature  we also meet fugly floom  an old softspoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel  utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions  not having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film  it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was  so as not to ruin this wellkept secret  i wont reveal the actors identity here  it was a treat indeed to see one of cinemas legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance  the greatest triumph of  babe  pig in the city  is the art direction  simply putit bleeds creativity  taking the look of the original film to a whole new level  restricted primarily to a farm the first time around  this second installment creates an entire city  dazzling us with unique fablelike architecture  but the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our worlds architectural landmarks  designing a skyline that includes the statue of liberty  the sydney opera house  the brooklyn bridge  the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower  ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities  as seen in the film photo and preproduction drawing to your right   added to that  many of this citys streets are the twin siblings of venices gondolatrekked rivers  the metropolis that has sprung from fords vision is a wondrous sight to behold  it is a world that you want to walk around in  norma moriceaus costume designs belong in this world  vibrant in color and style equal to that of the fords landscape  most of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish  with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly flooms clown outfit  andrew lesnies photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the films multiple emotional tones  much press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of  babe  pig in the city   reports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg13 rating  these reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating  but even so  to be anything harsher than the original s g rating had many parents and fans up in arms  by deleting a minimal number of shots   babe  pig in the city  was eventually given the coveted g rating  although appeased  many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark  fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself  well  to coin a phrase  the reports of  babe  pig in the city  s death at the hands of a dark  scary  felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated  granted it has its moments of pseudomorbidity  but allinall  babe  pig in the city  is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be  whatever  dark  moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller  the  mad max  trilogy   the witches of eastwick    lorenzos oil    having served as a producer and cowriter on the first film  miller moves into the directors chair for this one  putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise  the story of  babe  pig in the city  is an enchanting yarn  but one that doesnt achieve the emotional or character depth of the original  missing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity  an individuals worth  challenging conformity  and ones purpose in life    babe  dealt with this weighty subject matter  creating a timeless fable    babe  pig in the city  should not have rehashed these themes  but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones  this film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife  class differences  sacrificial courage  and so on  but this films goals arent as lofty as the firsts  instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach  allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting  sometimes intense  fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive    babe  pig in the city  also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film  specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe  hoggetts love for babe  which grew ever so gently  is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality  best exemplified in hoggetts dance for babe  this moving relationship was truly unique  it is something that i wish would have been present again  and could have through fugly floom   but was not  please understand  these are not negative criticisms  per se  but simply statements of what i see as the differences between  babe  pig in the city  being a very good film and the original being a great one  but having said that  these observations are minor critiques at best  as an overall piece   babe  pig in the city  is a thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end  sure  it isnt a great film  but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness  it is a film that is magical with its charm and humor  exciting in its adventurous exploits  funny with its dry wit and cute voices  and breathtaking in its presentation    babe  pig in the city  may not be moviemaking at its absolute best  but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema  as a result  if you choose to let this film pass you by  you will be missing of the years best cinematic treats

and original of them all has been the matrix  all the films released after it  have been less successful  david cronenbergs existenz  released only a couple of months after the matrix  was accepted and even appreciated  by some   but the hype was gone  and when the thirteenth floor aired this fall  it was completely overseen and ignored  i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying  feeling like eating the same meal over and over again  it was therefore i was less than excited  when i went out to see to the thirteenth floor  however  i was positively surprised by josef rusnaks latest picture  matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality  combining the best of hollywoods action and effects with an intelligent story  existenz was a violent  gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality  ending in blood and madness  the thirteenth floor is somewhere in between  instead of going after the crowds  the action audience  like the matrix   or aiming at the horror fans  like existenz   the thirteenth floor presents a more intelligent plot  witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience  that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding  in a near future    on the thirteenth floor of a classified building  a genius scientist  hannon fuller  has created a simulated world  his personal dreamworld  where every inhabitant is a complex  selflearning program that only believes it is real  right after the first testing of this world  fuller   is found murdered  douglas hall    his closest friend and business partner  immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth  a beautiful woman  gretchen mol  who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery  which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence  the first  download into simulation  is impressive  it is the creators first visit to his world  his creation  in order to enter this virtual universe  you have to take over someones identity  become another person  this is called conciseness transfer  and this is part of the tragedy in the film  people  wake up  in unknown places and strange things start happen  they start to doubt in their own sanity  these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their  users  and creators with their sanity and their lives  it is a frightening reality  the fact that all the people in the simulation  the program links  are living out their lives  oblivious  not knowing that they are puppets in someones fantasy  with an appealing   blade runner   type  of detective story  this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present  our modern world is metal and glass  cold  unfriendly  impersonal  the thirties are different  colorful  beautiful  elegant  virile  this contrast demonstrates a wish for change  virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical  enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities  to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise  to some a personal playground  a life without any consequences  for others  a way to start over and  correct  their mistakes  by living in an illusion of their past  virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes  dreams and fantasies to life  at least thats how it is all beginning  but when youre waking up from your dream  the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise  this  almost narcotic effect  soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness  some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised  what is real  what is thought  who are we  if these were answered  this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made  they are off course not answered  but posed in an intelligent manner  the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements  since it portrays the contrast between these computersimulated universes  kirk m  petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour  grace and color  and setting this world in opposition to our own  an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties  there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald kloses moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time  a rather unusual thing aboutthe thirteenth floor is the almost complete lack of special effects  there are no cgi animated creatures  no bullets in slow motion  this is a more philosophical approach  reminding about the european way of filmmaking  this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians  but the more serious science fiction buffs and dark cityfans will be pleased  this film is interesting and inspiring  it has everything existenz doesnt  but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix  and then there is a happy end which  like in dark city  completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context  the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think  since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics  including blade runner and dark city  with this in mind  the thirteenth floor doesnt make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now  yet this is a beautiful  elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality  
1	you think that these people only exist in the movies  but trust me  theyre as real as life  i once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual persons brain with microwaves  then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections  i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted  these people had what are known as  conspiracy theories   ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public  a little imagination goes a long way  in richard donners conspiracy theory  jerry fletcher  mel gibson  is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything  his latest  that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle  might sound outrageous to us  but is all in a days work for him  he combs the newspaper  looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goingson behind the scenes  and from there jerry draws his conclusions  upstanding citizen that he is  he tries to convince alice sutton  julia roberts  of the justice department that the president must be warned  lucky gal  alice  who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since  what she doesnt know is that jerrys interest in her is far more than  well  professional  he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment  but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerrys ideas and his limitedcirculation  conspiracy theory  newsletter  he finds himself in danger and in real need of alices help  one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an actionthriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action  nor a significant number of thrills  part of this is a result of the films slow pace  it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice  and even once that is over with  the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement  at over two hours  this film could have been significantly condensed and had its running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour  but even then  the action scenes would not be able to save the film  instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces  were treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite  black elements   black helicopter  men in black action suits and body armor  black vehicles  you know the drill  they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons  but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time  big deal  weve seen it all before  watching the film  i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination  but i was out of luck  now  when i say it took forever to set up the  relationship  between jerry and alice  i completely mean what one person is relative to the other  and not romantic involvement  oh  donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie  the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other  but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring  you see  there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies  also directed by donner  than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory  the two just dont click  and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether  like finding out hes been stalking her   the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced  the script in general also seems forced  like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it  then took it and forced it upon us  dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable  to the point that i almost stopped listening  even gibsons usual gift for ad lib couldnt punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest  although one of jerrys theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing  unfortunately  much of whats discussed in the film is not inherently important to whats going on  but instead filler that starts out with potential  but ends up just being extraneous because its never followed through  for example  jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station  he even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break  hence the water in a subway station   and that the coroner should check the mans lungs for chlorine  this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him  you know what happens then  nothing  zip  nada  no followup whatsoever  so whats the significance  okay  heres another one  a couple of well known  real life  assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j  d  salinger novel  the catcher in the rye   jerry also has a bunch of copies  whenever he goes into a bookstore  he has to buy one  leaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin  were never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin  not when we find out about his salinger collection  not when he goes to the bookstore  not later on when we get the answer to our first question  the point becomes totally extraneous  oh  did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film  yeah  he plays this government psychiatrist named dr  jonas who may or may not be a bad guy  thats about it  for all the presence this usually marvelous actor has  hes nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory  you can just lump him in with the supporting players  with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi  this guy was really likable  and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time  okay  heres my theory  this really started out as a great film  but some of its jokes were actually true  the government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security  and this was what was left over

0	i feel no hesitation in saying that  theres something about mary  is the best film that i will see all year  from the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture  there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998  it is that good of a film  when gene siskel said this about  fargo  only a few months into 96  i dismissed the notion as ridiculous  how could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it  but after seeing the farrellys hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork  i now know what siskel was talking about  once in a  very great  while  a film comes along that is so daring  so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end  you just want to stand up and cheer  and you know  at that instant  that you have just experienced something very special  now for the shocker   mary  is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed   pink flamingos  obviously notwithstanding   the movie is so rude and  i guess  inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents  luckily i had seen it before them  so i could warn the about what they were in for   forget  blazing saddles    animal house  and even the former king of grossout comedy   monty pythons meaning of life   they were all only preludes to the farrellys assault on the senses  in fact  this may even be the funniest film ive ever had the pleasure of seeing  the only real contender is  monty python and the holy grail    and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade  but as funny as it is  something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of  mary   it has a huge heart  you see  the farrellys are truly gifted filmmakers  they dont just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes  although there are plenty to go around   they also  very wisely  add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses  its funny  though  if you just look at an outline of the story  it seems kind of contrived and predictable  but believe me  it is anything but  ben stiller plays ted  a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe  mary  cameron diaz   after he sticks up for her retarded brother  warren  w  early brown  the cameraman  believe it or not  from  scream    his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom  in one of the films funniest scenes  something goes wrong  i wont ruin it for those who know nothing about the film  and ted is unable to face mary ever again  jump to the present  after years of selfloathing  ted finally hires private detective pat healy  a suitably slimy matt dillon  to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school  healy finds that mary is still a fullblown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself  admittingly  the basic story line leaves a little to be desired  after all  with a notreallyallthatfunny premise  how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours  somehow  the farrellys pull it off  the performances here are also right on target  as ted  stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating  as he would normally be  but very lovable  and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons  but the actor who really grabs your attention is w  earl brown as marys brother  no other actor has even come close to playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here  i know he wont be nominated  but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february  as good as the actors are  though  its the directors movie all the way  i guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year  you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielbergs wwii epic  saving private ryan   and yes  that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting  but which is harder  making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they cant breath for minutes at a time  ill let you decide that one for yourself  but this critic is sticking to his guns  there is just something about  mary   
1	it was with a huge lack of something to do that i decided to watch this on good old upn on sunday afternoon  when the only good things on tv are the secondrate movies they show  some are good  they showed  total recall  before this one   if you know me  i think seagal is probably the most boring action star to ever live  and this includes keanu reeves  what do i hate about seagal  i hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening and nonthreatening situation  the squint   i hate those scenes in every movie where he goes around  bullying people up  saying stupid lines with a brooklyn accent more fake than burt reynolds hairpiece in  boogie nights   i despise how he never gets a bruise in any of his fights  i hate how every single plot twist leads to just a melodramatic fight between he and the chief villain  i hate his nonsatirical messages  in the beginning of this one  he slaps on a quote from arthur miller  which has nothing to do with the film  except its about brooklyn where this film takes place   and i hate how hes so narcissistic that he thinks that he can actually fucking sing  during the end credits  he has a good old hill billy rock tune sung and penned by him   sure  the guys probably a nice guy in person  i actually found him very nonthreatening when he was on letterman not too long ago   but the guy makes worse films than reagan did  so whats the plot of this shitterpiece  well    something about him trying to catch a stupidass crook  william forsythe  who shot and killed his partner in broad daylight  i couldnt believe how bad this scene was  the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect  ahem    and forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off  im sorry  did anyone ever hear of concealing ones self  so in comes exbrooklynite seagal  who dedicates his life to catching this guy  and i just wished he had caught him in the beginning  then ended the film  but noooo  this drags on  as he bullies forsythes family members  including a stupid barowner  and none other than gina gershon as his other barowner sister   and forsythe more than once threatens his family  at one point  he actually comes to their house and stalks them like a nonthreatening nicholson in  the shining   complete with them all hiding in the bathroom  but with an added bonus of one girl conveniently loosing her cool and screaming to give them away   seagal paints himself as a lovable person  with a son  and a fiancee  he even shows him hanging with his son  checking up on his homework  and then about to take him out for a bit of  catch   when hes conveniently called away on assignment  i dunno about you  but playing  catch  with seagal was one of my childhood nightmares  he also shows him as that badass he wants to be  with scenes of him bullying crooks around  and taking out people who are stupid enough to attack him even after hes unarmed a chinese guy swinging bats with a pool cue  serves them right  this film  as some of his do  has an interesting supporting cast of actors who are actually talented  but dont appear to be in this film  i already mentioned gina gershon  whos pretty horrible in this one   as well as william forsythe  who overacts terribly  i know this guy can act  he was awesome in  raising arizona  as goodmans partner in crime  but hes just awful here  jerry orbach gives the only credible performance in the film as the police chief who checks up on segal after things have gone down  why is he the only one who gives a good performance  well  because his role is small enough and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility  he seems to be in here just to give it a cool  law and order  feeling  even if its not a  cool  feeling   and in cameos are brated eroticthrillercinemaxstyle stars  shannon whirry  as  terry malloy   which is more of a bad joke than a clever one  and athena massey  oh  and  er  s julliana margiulles has two scenes    out for justice  just proves once again that american action films just suck  i know that theres such a good thing as good action  hes called john woo  but if youre in the mood for some good old nobrainer  funyetdumb action  dont bother watching this  its so stupid that its boring  
0	with stars like sigourney weaver   alien  trilogy  and academy award winner holly hunter  the piano  raising arizona  etc   together in a single hollywood production  one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot  sadly for copycat  though tightly scripted and nicely plot  is still at heart  a typical hollywood thriller  helen  weaver   after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer  darryl  harry connick jr    has developed a phobia for being outdoors  so to speak  incidentally  helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers  which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes  a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco  detective monahan  hunter  and getz  mulroney   baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer  seeks the professional help of helen  who  as expected was reluctant at first  copycat  borrows  a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases  it did work  but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability  this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also    much of the time wasted couldve been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama  even so  weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments    weaver being the vulnerable yet strongwithin character  as in aliens  and hunter being the short  tough  texan speaking cop  as in raising arizona   harry connick jr   a very good jazz singer  shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter  which comes to the moment of judgement  drum roll please      copycat is a good thriller  although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show  copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats  in anticipation of the killers next immediate move  this worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts  nice movie to bring your girlfriend to

1	bruce willis and sixth sense director m  night shyamalan reteam to tell the story of david dunne  willis   a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child  on a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job  dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of  to make things even stranger  dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed  a comic book art dealer named elijah price  samuel l  jackson   who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly  has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life  price felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him    someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break  price contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child  dunne doesnt believe him at first  but price assists him in discovering his  powers  and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is  writerdirector m  night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense  how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years  for shyamalan  the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners  does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash  though  the answer to that question is not a very easy one  either  as far as pacing goes  the sixth sense seemed almost interminable  it wasnt until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally  and perfectly  paced in order to give the audience ample time to reconnect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached  for unbreakable  shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which  in many ways  blows away the film that had come before  the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalans direction is excellent  with the camera almost constantly moving  there are tons of great shots in the film  not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis character and another train passenger  the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak  also very impressive is the films score by james newton howard  who also scored shyamalans sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes  as well as this years dinosaur   several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film  one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to  exercise  his powers  the music  in combination with the stellar visuals  really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie  if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year  this one would be it  the film also boasts some great performances  including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment  willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne  who just cant seem to figure out why hes been depressed for the last few years  his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him  but he eventually grows into his own under elijahs tutelage  jackson is one of the better actors of our time  and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah  though his hairstyle is absurd  jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked  robin wright penns role seems slightly underwritten  but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her characters need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again  spencer treat clark  as the dunnes young son jeremy  shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors  and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film  out of all the characters  jeremys is perhaps the most emotional  and clark does a great job with the role  where the film does lose points though  is during its  surprise  ending  shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense  but i found myself saying  that was it    when unbreakable revealed its own ending  its not that the ending is bad  its just that the ending doesnt quite have the emotional punch that the other films did  plus  it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels  and i wont reveal the ending here  but youll understand what i mean when you see it   essentially  what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable  the only real problem is that the ending doesnt quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor  as long as it isnt held to the standard that sixth sense set  which it ultimately will be   it should be a remarkably well liked film  one thing seems clear  though  shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film  
1	i cant recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota  for forty minutes or so  i was lured into a loopy if occasionally overwrought romantic comedy  and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt  then  rather suddenly  i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence  shortly thereafter  i was whacked in the gut by another  feeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated  as though i had trusted writerdirector steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face  feeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie  cameron diaz  who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red  delroy lindo  suspects her of stealing from him  reds punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper  sam clayton  vincent donofrio   who is far from the man of freddies dreams  enter jjaks  keanu reeves   sams estranged younger brother  who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddies eye and have sex with her in the bathroom  united in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam  jjaks and freddie take off together  but sam isnt ready to let them go without a fight  freddie  meanwhile  isnt ready to let sams money go without a fight  and thus begins a series of violent confrontations  there is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota  as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sams intense sibling rivalry as boys  and their mother  tuesday weld  sending jjaks away to live with his father  it does a great job of setting up jjaks unstable life  a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family  reeves wounded look is just right for jjaks  the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments  most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin  most important  baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy  as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements  i will dare  on the car radio  you would have every reason to expect that relationships  both familial and romantic  would be the focal point of feeling minnesota  unfortunately  you would be dead wrong  i suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding  but i certainly didnt expect what i got  what i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality  or rather creating gags about brutality  suddenly  the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse  and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable  the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another  but there is no consistency to the characterizations  vincent donofrio turns in a manic performance as sam  whose jealousy  competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks  while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction  and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood  there are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully  jonathan demmes something wild and neil jordans the crying game come to mind   but they didnt try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment  i dont want to dismiss baigelmans successes out of hand  he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop  and some wellcrafted comic moments  and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a lighthearted caper  it is his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value  and that he cant make his two halves into a whole  feeling minnesota left me feeling used  and theres not much funny about that  
0	after the huge success of  the exorcist  in 1973 a sequel was inevitable  and sadly like most horror fims that make money  the filmmakers decided to make a ridiculous sequel  that makes absolutely no sense at all  and to me was extremely pointless  wasting linda blair and max von sydow completely  needless  dumb sequel flopped in the box office  and never gained much success though it is voted as one of the worst sequels of all time  to which i agree with  to start the  story  it is four years later  and regan is being tormented by memories of what used to be  now a priest played by richard burton  is trying to figure out why this demon tried to possess regan  and now the demon somehow wants to possess her again  maybe she was good or something   now they must try to stop this demon from taking over regans body  before it is too late  some of the bad things exorcist ii has in it is  linda blair  she had no need to revive her character  and she is really terrible in this film  she brings it down to a lull  and in places it seems like it just stops in its place  and doesnt go anywhere  louise fletcher is alright for what its worth  but she could have done a lot better than this  the direction by john boorman  is that of a confused  stylish nature that i really couldnt figure out  in fact  i had no idea what was going on in this film  the script was jumbled  the plot was jumbled  and the ending is just laugh out loud hilariosly bad  for those exorcist fans who havent seen this one  i recommend renting it  i actually gave this one a high rating  if it were any worse it would have deserved zero pumpkins  i went easy on it however because of the fact that it has a bit of good direction  but nothing else  im not saying i like the film now  so dont start going anywhere  bad  bad  bad movie  
1	after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film  you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again  there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles  as a master would teach an eager apprentice    you caress the noodles with the chopsticks   he says   then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying  see you soon    of course  its meant to be a parody  but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety  you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat  not something you like  not something you enjoy  but rather something you experience  experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses  fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts  trust me  you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point  juzo itamis tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western  set in modern day japan  a stranger  goro  tsutomu yamazaki   comes into town and finds tampopo  nobuko miyamoto   the proprietor of a small  holeinthewall noodle shop  trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman  pisken  rikiya yasuoka   goro  to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles  gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen  emerging bloodied  but victorious  goro finds that tampopos ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away  just to eat a bowl of her ramen  the problem is  her fare is something less than popular  and less than appetizing  however  goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest  and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert  enlist the aid of a wealthy patron  and make friends with the former enemy  this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems  take  for example  when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner  the price is too high  but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum  tampopo meets him at his store late at night  and he leads her to a back room  she protests  thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives  but he insists  just when she is about to bolt for the exit  he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door  she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day  her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience  this scene  while comical  is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation  then of relief and discovery  theres also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who  despite their economic trappings  are all gourmets and master sommeliers  we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet  the scene is meant to bring a laugh  but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor  food is something which everyone has in common  and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all  there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film  which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in peoples lives  a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor  surrounded by her children  she is obviously in her last hours of life  her husband comes home  and seeing her worsened condition  demands that she get up and make dinner  the viewer knows the husbands intention is not to be mean  he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived  and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this  in a near miracle  the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal  then brings it to her awaiting family  as the family eats  she looks on them and smiles  preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her  and for a brief moment  she too enjoys the normalcy  then she falls over  dead  for a moment  the family is stunned  but then the father yells at the children   keep eating  this is the last meal your mother ever made   crying as they do so  the family finishes the meal  the scene is comical  awkward  moving  and beautiful  by including the vignettes  itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film  but surprisingly  they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline  instead  they even help contribute to the idea that tampopos goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble  because the film parodies a western  the construction of the plot is fairly predictable  but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the  good guys  come together for the final showdown  in this case  the showdown is against the ramen  if they eat tampopos ramen  soup and all  tampopo knows she has succeeded  its pretty obvious what the outcome will be  but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life  you can afford to cut it a little slack  
1	movies like six days  seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford  anne heche  and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents   the script was written by michael browning  and he decided that  instead of thinking up new ideas  hed rehash a lot of cliches  omit even the slightest bit of character development  and then throw in drugdealing pirates to provide for a few highlevel action sequences and explosions   there are good scripts out there that highprofile actors can make  see the truman show  for instance    six days  seven nights is simply a waste  lets see      we have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island   so  how do we do that   well  well make her a feisty magazine editor  and well make him a crusty old pilot   but wait  she has to have a fianc  e  that can be david schwimmer   but wait  if she has a fianc  e  how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone   i know   theyll get to their vacation spot  and then shell get called back   yessssss   so  theyll crash on the island  and that will be funny for about five minutes   shucks  oh  ive got it   well throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc  e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo  and then he can feel guilty   then  when anne heche kisses harrison ford  they have to kiss  because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie   it will be a vindicated action  because her fianc  e will already have cheated on her   then  for no obvious reason  theyll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them   oh  yes   i feel so good about this story   instead of using characterization to propel the events  it will be completely random  and yet totally predictable   imagine that  dont get me wrong  six days  seven nights is not a boring picture  ford and heche both do a great job   the sparks fly between them  and so most of brownings inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors sheer force of talent    almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen  and i found myself laughing pretty hard   schwimmer is also funny  and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get   and reitman  who has made some good films  at least tries to make things exciting   even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb  i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences  its just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces   the picture feels like its been hacked to pieces  i wouldnt be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely   the ones that are here are as bad as they come  i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships   and id just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream   why did you pick this awful script     the film is outright stupid  but some of the elements are subtly horrifying   for instance  take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo  and then feels really guilty   this is a serious problem in real life  but six days  seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device   his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford   in a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety  i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story  this is summer movie season  but that doesnt mean our movies have to be dumb   1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters   when i was in line for six days  seven nights  i heard the woman in front of me ask for  two tickets to that new harrison ford movie     why didnt she know the name of the film   i suppose she just didnt care    what bothers me even more is that the people who make these bigbudget pictures dont realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves   good actors should sign to good scripts  and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash  they least they could do is assume that wed like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents

0	big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america  o  j  simpson  tom capano  the menendez brothers  all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms  and  of course  courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood  whether it be john grishams thrilling novels or televisions famous dramas  the courtroom has always provided big bucks  so when i rented a civil action  i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker  a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat  however  what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected  a major surprise  but fortunately  a pleasant one  john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it  no one expected him to light up the screen in grease  nor in saturday night fever  but  whenever he gets knocked down  he always seems to come back fighting  a civil action is not johns best performance  but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998  travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations  his performance is not flashy  nor memorable  just solid  if he delivered the only solid performance  this film would still be average  luckily  he has a strong supporting cast  william h  macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood  he continues to deliver great performances one after the other  but he is still regarded as a secondary actor  in a civil action  he delivers yet another great performance as travoltas paranoid and greedy accountant  he is not a lovable character  but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film  he is not one of the big time lawyers  just a measly accountant  but  he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998  but there is actually someone better in a civil action  robert duvall is also an underrated actor  he gets many leading roles  but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks  brad pitt and jim carrey  duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the codefendant  duvall is magical in this role  he is the wise teacher  who not only battles it out in the courtroom  but also manages to teach every major player a lesson  in his own twisted way  in many noncomedic films  directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy  to keep the audience on their toes  unfortunately  they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny  jarjar binks  anyone    however  this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed  this is not the case in a civil action  they have comedy coming from all sides  whether it be duvalls inane questions or macys sharp anger  the laughs come in a steady pace  granted  its not roll in the aisle funny  but it provides a nice addition to the film  the plot is terrific somewhat  the setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom  then the case that will make or break jan  travolta  s career rears its ugly head  they find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it  however  budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt  i will not spoil the rest  although i must speak of the one downside to the film  the courtroom debates are great  but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored  it left me somewhat confused  although the rest of the film is terrific  all in all  john travolta is back yet again in this great film  his supporting cast  consisting of macy and duvall  turn in tremendous performances  which ease the load on travolta  the film is smart  witty and thought provoking  not only does it gauge incourt battles  but also the various tolls it can take on the major players  a civil action provides everything a drama lover craves  
0	one of the best things about my job is that  every so often  a film still catches me by surprise    spy kids  certainly did  an adventure story aimed primarily at children  the movie is smart  zippy fun  the production neither panders nor talks down to its audience  the brother and sister at the center of the tale are believable  likable kids and their parents are  get ready for this  intelligent  capable and loving  bathroom humor is kept to a minimum and the numerous wellstaged action scenes avoid excessive violence  what a relief it is to be able to review an allages film on its artistic merits and not its ethics  consider the other pg rated  family friendly  movie in theaters now    see spot run  has a mother going out of town  leaving her son with an idiot neighbor  body function humor abounds  including a slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop  what really disturbs me are the jokes that bookend the film  the story begins with a police dog capturing a mobster and biting off one of his testicles in the process  at the hospital  the doctors explain that they replaced the testicle with a metal ball and joke that the victim is lucky the dog didnt bit off the other one  because two metal replacement balls would clack together  of course  the movie ends with the dog biting off the remaining testicle and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells  somebody clue me in  when did genital mutilation become funny    spy kids  is a welcome antidote to the repellent  see spot run   using imagination instead of cruelty and crudeness  carmen  alexa vega  and her younger brother juni  daryl sabara  live in a beautiful seaside home with their parents  gregorio  antonio banderas  and ingrid cortez  carla gugino   mom and dad are a sultry couple devoted to their children  what the kids dont know is that they are also former spies  once agents from different countries assigned to  erase  each other  they instead fell in love  married and retired to raise a family  needless to say  they get drawn back to the business  shortly into their first joint mission  they are captured and end up in the headquarters of fegan floop  alan cumming   a foppish hybrid of willy wonka and pee wee herman who hosts junis favorite tv show  but there is evil behind the scenes  as inventors prepare an army of robots disguised as children  papa gregorio has the device necessary to radically increase the efficiency of the creatures and the bad guys will stop at nothing to get it from him  back at home   uncle  felix  cheech marin  shows up to reveal mom and dads secret to the kids  after a brief respite at a safe house filled with enough cool gadgets for a dozen sharper image stores  carmen and juni set off to find their parents and save the world  zooming through the sea in a submarine pod that looks like a goldfish  while a slew of wicked people  including teri hatcher  chase them  during the course of their adventures  they get to use jet packs  electroshock bubblegum and supercomputer sunglasses  they watch as secret agents are transformed into bizarre creatures with silly putty faces and used as background characters on floops tv show  they deal with guards that have huge thumbs where their arms  legs and heads would normally be  why are the guards so ineffective  because theyre all thumbs   they move from one colorful locale to another  including a nifty virtual reality room reminiscent of the holodeck from  star trek   the storyline is silly and convoluted  but even at its most dense  it is easier to follow than either  mission  impossible  movie  director robert rodriguez   from dusk to dawn   maintains a frenetic pace  with the whole film clocking in at a mere 86 minutes  a bit less action and a little more character development would have been nice  but he does provide enough quiet moments for viewers to become fully invested in the family  alexa vega and daryl sabara make an agreeable brother and sister team  squabbling the way kids do  but coming together when it counts  antonio banderas and carla gugino are even better as the parents  they quickly establish and maintain a great lusty chemistry while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes  even the usually irritating alan cumming has some nice moments  a virtual cloudbacked chat between his character and juni is one of the best segments in the film  had rodriguez added a few more scenes like that  i would have enjoyed the film more  and i definitely could have lived without the glaring product placement for a certain mcubiquitous company   regardless   spy kids  is a hoot  offering fun for adults and children alike  and just think  they managed to do it without sacrificing a single testicle  
1	  hes back  and its about time   was the motto for this television series pilot  i call it a pilot  i dont care what fox network says  revival of the cult classic british tv show  doctor who  that spawned no series  which means there are no smart network execs out there  not exactly news to a lot of people  i know   the motto was well chosen  the series was simple  it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies  including the evil daleks  and the master  who appears in this feature  played very badly by eric roberts  as good as this revival was  there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who  is it the acting  hell  no  paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys whove played the doctor  including his predecessor and offscreen friend sylvester mccoy  who appears once more for the regeneration scene   he looks right for the role  is a brilliant actor  and slips effortlessly into the role  the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would  daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr  grace holloway  the doctors first companion that he kisses on screen  she is not your typical female companion who screams  and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor  she is a tough  spunky american  and ashbrook shows this well  young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee  and ive seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end  this film included   which  imho  wastes his talent  the only problem with the acting is eric roberts  one time he had to say to mcganns doctor   i always dress for the occasion   but he broke it up  and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric   i always    dress    for the occasion   you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act  and whos also british  like mcgann is as the doctor  executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role  i dunno who thought of casting him  but if theyre reading this  news flash  eric roberts is  not  a star  he rides on his sisters coattails  and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him  is this problem the kisses to the past  they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them  only whovians would  and theyre good  is it the script or the movie as a whole  the script is a classy piece of work  featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue  and the movie as a whole is one fans will love  and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series  so what is it  simple  no plot  the master  on his last legs  sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him  the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey  but they accidentally land in san francisco  1999  december 31  where the master  with young street hood chang lees help  opens the eye of harmony  which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor  with the help of female surgeon  dr  grace holloway  doesnt close it by then  virtually no plot  i was told the movie wouldve featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks  but a lot of rewriting went on on the set  that shows how smart people are  as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting  and that wouldve gotten a four star rating out of me  
1	the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and  real  movies  consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved  lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste  topflight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety  based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks  the movie represents a rethinking of the storys structure  not merely a literal adaptation of the novel  told in linear form by four narrators in the book  egoyans version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator  the author is even on record as applauding egoyans changes  in the press notes the books author describes the story as  a parable of lost children   he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children  picking up on this  egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter  nicole burnell  played with grace by sarah polley  reads parts of  the pied piper  from an old  illustrated book to her two charges  periodically throughout the picture  nicoles readings are heard in voiceover  you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment  they and the rest of the towns children come into harms way  some live and others are seriously injured  and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again  although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children  the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss  ian holm  in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career  plays mitchell stephens  an intense man of quiet misery  mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small  snowencrusted community in the british columbian wilderness  his mission there is a singular one  to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone  anyone  on their behalf  if this seems crass  well it is  but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot  the story unfolds slowly and always believably  each little aspect has its own fascination  as mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker  played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson  he has a simple task  he wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit  wendell ticks off one town member after another and then  as one can in a small town  enumerates each persons numerous faults  although the town is no peyton place  people there do have their foibles  one of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell  bruce greenwood   who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave goodbye to his kids  well  single parent billys fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita  his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story  the accident itself  a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice  isnt shown until the middle of the picture  but  nevertheless  the mystery about it builds throughout the film  although the picture is no detective story  finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy  as the injured bus driver  gabrielle rose  dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning  to round out the story  mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear  his daughter zoe  caerthan banks  is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one halfway house and recovery center after another  fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help  she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk     i can help you   mitchell tries to reassure billy    not unless you can raise the dead   billy snaps back  mitchells pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder   mychael dannas haunting music sets the stage for tragedy  the cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur  but it is in the warm  shadowy  intimate moments indoors where it works best  the show  which is ripe for emotional manipulation  never plays with its audience  still  when the house lights go up  you may feel as i did  i could barely breathe  i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed  more than anything  the film is like a master painting  each cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint  with the final color in place  the masterpiece is complete  and the ending credits roll  the sweet hereafter runs 1  50  it is rated r for mature themes  sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers  
1	the 1990s produced two brilliant science fiction films  one was gattaca  the other was the thirteenth floor  just as gattaca was overshadowed by the mighty titanic  the thirteenth floor was relegated to obscurity by the matrix  however  the thirteeth floor  though it deals with similar themes  is a much better movie than the frenetic  childish and improbable matrix  a cutting edge computer scientist  hannon fuller  played by the charming armin muellerstahl   is murdered  his associate  douglas hall   craig bierko  apparently framed and suspected by the police  enters into the simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery  along the way a beautiful blonde  gretchen mol   more bodies  and a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture  the thirteenth floor unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches  choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise  the result is a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view  first  its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline  second and more seriously  it demands that its audience think and feel  no wonder it fell through the cracks  done in film noir style as a murder mystery  this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels  many audiences will simply be bewildered by it  rather than engaged  which is a shame  because this movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment  i recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie  despite its philosophical challenges  the thirteenth floor derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller  mol  and douglas hall  bierko   as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller  in that sense it is more akin to gattaca than the matrix  which  for all of its cute philosophical byplay  is an adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever  the moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying  wrenching and intellectually challenging  in its final moments the film even takes on itself  when david  janes husband  who has come to enjoy killing  accuses her of being the sick one  although there is a victory for the leading characters  this resolution suggests a disturbing element of fantasy in jane  and thus a deepseated character flaw  in fact  hannon fullers activities in the simulated world  the behavior of janes husband  and the effects of entering the simulation on douglas hall all hint at similar issues with those characters  this is not a film of good people beset from without by great evil  the tragedy is not in their stars  but in themselves  the major actors  all of whom are required to play two or even three roles  perform extremely well  bierko  who will be familiar as the psycho from the long kiss goodnight  is outstanding  donofrio as whitney  who plays a pivotal role in support  also turns in a good performance  the lovely gretchen mol  whose elegance  integrity  and determination suggest bergman in casablanca  does a wonderful job  her voice  however  lacks the necessary weight at times  this could be because she was given the worst lines in a movie whose major weakness is the script  some minor flaws  hairline cracks in fine porcelain  appear in places  there are one or two instances of jerky editing  the script takes the edge off the films climaxes  the atmosphere becomes too claustrophobic at times  yet  there is a clue there too   one wonders if even after two decades  blade runner is still casting its long shadow over scifi films  one can see a group of suits in their suite  waving their hands imperiously at directors like the emperor in amadeus   make it more likeblade runner  you know  dark and rainy   the thirteen floor is that rare exception among hollywood movies  a  rich  emotionally satisfying  intelligent scifi movie  and yet  ultimately  it proves the suits right  for when good scifi is made  where is the sf community turning out in droves to see it  if we dont support great sf  who will

coproducers stan wlodkowski alan ball music by thomas newman costume designer julie weiss film editor tariq anway chris greenbury production designer naomi shohan director of photography conrad l  hall  a  s  c  produced by bruce cohen  dan jinks written by alan ball directed by sam mendes   both my wife and daughter think im this gigantic loser  and theyre right  i have lost something  i didnt always feel this sedated   with that piece of dialogue  we are fully introduced to lester burnham  kevin spacey   a 42 year old man trapped within his own life  lester works for an advertising agency  his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the midlife crisis he is suffering  estranged from both his wife and his daughter  lester starts to crack under the stress  his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies  and sullen apathy  carolyn burnham  annette bening   is the prototypical career woman homemaker  she carefully tends her rose garden  decorates her home with the best furnishings  but inside she is desperate  unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent  she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family  the third member of this antifamily is jane burnham  thora birch   lester and carolyns daughter  a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence  but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction  this funny  and frightening  slice of life is refreshingly simple  not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her  some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters  most notably is barbara fitts  allison janney   the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts  she has almost no dialogue  and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one  colonel fitts  chris cooper  is an angry and frightened man  his rage directed almost singularly at his son  ricky  wes bentley  who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnhams  in fact they are the next door neighbors  anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in  american beauty   alan ball  who was the coexecutive producer of the hit tv series  cybil  and creator of the new sitcom  oh grow up   has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years  not one character in this film rings falsely  and the depth of personality in each  is achingly honest and insightful  the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as  the graduate  or  lolita   kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances  his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age  finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become  lester tries to return to his youth  he quits his job  actually blackmailing his employer for one years salary   starts smoking pot  fantasizes about his daughters girlfriend angela  mena suvari  in a marvelous performance here   starts working out  and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet  mr  spaceys performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous  that we can be certain that come oscar  time  we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees  annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career  carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy  unable to cope with her growing disillusionment  she forces herself to maintain her demeanor  driving her further and further into desperation  adultery and possibly murder  ms  bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone  the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words  thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her  jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family  and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment  her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning  she is the prototypical trophy child  when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team   im so proud of you  honey  you didnt screw up once     the bitterness and resentment are palpable  thora birch is a young actress to watch  praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance  colonel finn is a man in complete denial  his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend  wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma  the boy next door who may be more foe than friend  a deceitful and calculating young man  whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him  mr  bentleys performance is the one troublesome note in the film  that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar  that one almost faults the performance for it  director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle  scenes of carolyn walking through the rain  carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character  the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful  capturing the season in all of its harsh beauty  fall has never looked so inviting  yet depressing   every nuance of  american beauty  begs its audience to think and examine  it is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come  and well it should  as it is simply one of this years best  
0	the coen brothers are back again  this time with homers  odyssey  as the backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a mississippi chain gang who trek across the south to find a secret treasure in  o brother  where art thou   right for the beginning of  o brother  the coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a work song  the camera flows around the hard toiling men  giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our three heroes  ulysses everett mcgill  george clooney   delmar  tim blake nelson  and pete  john turturro   escaping across a cotton field  it is the beginning of a journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies to each member of the trio  a strong suite  as always with the coen brothers  is the depth of character of the folks they create in their films  their characters are goofy and comical  like nicolas cage in  raising arizona   or  dramatic  as albert finney and john turturro in  millers crossing   and  even a mix of the two with frances mcdormand in  fargo   in all cases  and in  o brother   too  the characters populating their films are threedimensional people  ulysses everett is a handsome  hairobsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brains department  but  he seems like a genius when compared to the simple  sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete  who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of 1  2 million  their odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homers original material as they meet all manner of people along the way  including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a cyclops who beats them and takes all their money  there is magic  too  when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens  the story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys adventures  giving the flick a choppy  episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow  some of the interludes are an epiphany  though  the trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitarplaying tommy johnson  chris thomas king  and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere  run by its blind owner  stephen root   they become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and  without their knowledge  are recorded as they sing the traditional tune   i am a man of constant sorrow   it is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and gives us  in my mind  the best movie song of the year  contrasting this and other wonderful moments  the sexy seduction by the sirens comes to mind  are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of  o brother   in particular  near the end  is a scene where ulysses  delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched  the scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of  the wizard of oz   they dont say  lions and tigers and bears  oh my   and theres no dorothy  but it is the land of oz were seeing here  the highs and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels  george clooney is funny  charming  a little dumb and one of the handsomest actors in the business today  he has the charm of a 30s movie idol and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity  ulysses has an ongoing obsession with his hair  risking life and limb to get a particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnets  his vanity will come to plague him as it would any mystical herowanderer  while clooney is the name draw for  o brother   the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar  the heretofore unknown nelson is terrific as the simple convict who  at one point  hears the word of the lord and joins members of a church congregation in their mass baptism  delmar is saved and dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple character that makes him shine  the taciturn pete  as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro  is the sullen member of the trio and gives them the necessary angst  all together  the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooges and the three musketeers as they prove to be buffoons  albeit brave ones  the colorful supporting cast is rampant with homerian characters to meet and get to know along the way of the boys odyssey  charles durning appears as incumbent governor pappy odaniel  who keeps crossing paths with them in his bid for reelection  john goodman is wicked as the oneeyed bible salesman and con artist  big dan teague  michael badalucco is manic and outrageous as outlaw and bank robber extraordinary  george  babyface  nelson  stephen root is amusing as the blind dj  reping one of the many references to the sightless that abound in the film in mystical ways  holly hunter is wasted in the small role as ulysses estranged wife  penny  and the real reason for this adventure  not secret treasure   techs are  as expected in a coen brothers venture  first class  cinematographer roger deakins  who has worked on five previous coen films  captures the sultry atmosphere of the south  the photography complements the lush period production and costume provided by dennis gassner and mary zophres  respectively  once again  roderick jaynes  the alter ego of ethan and joel coen  is on board as editor  the high points outweigh the low through most of  o brother  where art thou   with particular praise for the wonderful selection of period and traditional music  i give it a b  
1	seen july 8  1998 at the crossgates cinema 18   albany  ny   theater 7  at 8  15 p  m  with my mom using hoyts cinema cash  theater rating     12  very good sound  picture  and seats its very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic  vivid sense of reality and life  all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters lives  but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do  therefore   gone with the wind  deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does  in such a crafted  intricate  and entertaining manner  its a crowning achievement  not only in filmmaking  but for storytelling itself  the film takes place in georgia before  during  and after the civil war  this plays a major factor in the films success  to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy  it might also seem cliche  boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers  can a story set so long ago be relatable now  the film confronts all these problems  paradoxically  by not cronfronting them  it doesnt simply plug in the  right thing  at the  right time   it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant  building a strong foundation is important to all forms of media  without which  what is there to build on  were given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters  especially our main character  scarlett ohara  leigh   a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel  a cunning wit  and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time  she knows how her society works  wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her  right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be  being the most soughtafter woman allows her to manipulate men  and their women  to ensure she gets her way  whether it be obvious  i  e  who will be the one to get her food   or subtle  i  e  getting married just to spite someone   the man she claims to love is ashley wilkes  howard   a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him  he isnt so arrogant and demanding as scarlett  in fact  hes engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his  her name is melanie  de havilland   and she is one of the sweetest  kindest  and most likable characters one will ever see  she and scarlett become very dear friends  but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her  and the love she has for her husband  her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic  it defines who she is  but doesnt give her much emotional selfdefense  acting a catalyst to the love triangle  and to the story as a whole is the daper  stongwilled  cunning  cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler  gable   hes quite a character all right  everyone listens to what he has to say even though hes got a bad reputation  butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior  he tells everyone the muchneeded truth in the rigid castelike society where freewill doesnt seem to exist  everything is done out of honor and tradition  for example  in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners theres no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out  this angers them  not for his lack of faith  but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that    do we have ammunition factories  do we have food  do we have a navy  all we have is tobacco   all true statements and yet the south still insists hes wrong  butler is a shifty character to be sure  but he takes such pride in his arrogance its appealing  scarlett notices this too when she first sees him  and from the look butler gives her  we know hes not going to stop until he has her  but scarlett cant get past her need for ashley  and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story  butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever  and so the story goes on  with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life  the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband  especially after she is  marked  for life when her first husband dies  this gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story  some are vital for only a few scenes  but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film  in most films only a few characters exist for support in background  but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance  even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set  the costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place  the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside  real world  but these types of simple approaches are never taken  the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war  fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is  one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming   no  not my leg  dont cut off my leg   another scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street  but as the camera pulls back  we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers  but it is their moaning thats more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be  as the second half begins  the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who singlehandedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north  she manages to resurrect the family plantation  but all the willpower she has cant help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the souths ultimate defeat  this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love hate relationship  most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship  or lack thereof  between rhett and scarlett  each uses the other for personal gain  but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other  scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett cant help but want her more every time she tries to oneup him such as marrying another man and taking over his business  they say opposites attract  but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities  it borders on magnetic polarization  they need each other and know this  yet they never seem truly happy together  perhaps they mistake love for passion  and the film leaves it up to us to make this call  both have things the other wants and vice versa  but when they compromise  is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other  love and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film  were left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why  gable and leigh do have great chemistry  always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture  all  none  either way is possible and its a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings  its safe to say most of us wont live such overly dramatic lives as those in  gone with the wind   but its still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that weve just experienced a lifes worth of joy and pain  
1	one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself  such was the case with boxing helena  1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch  daughter of the great david lynch  made in the dying years of posttwin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs  it was hyped as another   warped  twisted masterpiece  of lynch clan  kim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract  but  the result was extremely disappointing film  which quickly sank into welldeserved oblivion  the movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh  played by julian sands   talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena  sherilyn fenn   beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair  cavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to reestablish the relationship  during one of such occasions  helena is hit by a car  and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her  after she wakes up  helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaughs stylish residence  but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping  she is still trying to escape  so cavanaugh takes off her arms  apart from casting sherilyn fenn  audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart  and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies  this film by ms  lynch hasnt got anything in common with the works of directors more talented father  despite rather bizarre subject  the style of this film is conventional and setting is light  characters are beautiful  but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray  jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic  its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos  the actors arent good either  julian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man  this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains  being neurotic doesnt suit him  bill paxton was better for this role  but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helenas boyfriend  sherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks  but even the her greater effort in acting couldnt help this film  the screenplay  on the other hand  is awful  at least for someone who had made bestseller with laura palmers diary  the events in this movie are implausible  characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion  one of those subplots involves character of cavanaughs  regular  girlfriend  played by betsy clarke  the twist at the end  although unpredictable  is unbelievable and the viewers  who had the stomach to endure entire film  would feel cheated  all in all  boxing helena is disorganised quasiartistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basingers career  
1	if you want some hearty laughs  then rat race is the movie for you  this unpretentious little comedy  which sneaks into theaters today with very little hype  will have you bouncing in your theater seat  and while the film fits neatly into the lowbrow  slapstick school of comedy  one refreshing aspect is its lack of meanspiritedness  the plot follows a group of people chosen at random by an eccentric las vegas casino owner  john cleese  who must race from vegas to a bus station locker 700 miles away in silver city  n  m  inside the locker is a duffel bag containing 2 million  the first one to open the locker  gets the bag and the money  what the group of participants doesnt know is that cleeses donald sinclair   i can do anything i want  im eccentric    is staging the race as a betting game for a group of high rollers at the hotel  the participants include vera  whoopi goldberg  and merrill  lanai chapman   a newly reunited mother and daughter  disgraced pro football referee owen templeton  cuba gooding jr    italian tourist mr  pollini  rowan atkinson   randy pear  jon lovitz  and his family  the bumbling con men duane and blaine cody  seth green and vince vieluf   and cynical young lawyer nick shaffer  breckin meyer   various amusing encounters and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city  screenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by not having the racers try to sabotage one another  the most sidesplitting situations involve vera and merrills encounter with the squirrel lady  a nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates  owens commandeering a charter bus full of lucille ball lookalikes on their way to a lucy convention  the cody brothers misadventures with a hotair balloon  a flying cow and a monster truck  and the pear familys stopover at a barbie museum  which turns out not to be what they think it is  the pear family situation is a fine example of the way breckmans script builds the laughs  without going into detail  this bit segues from the museum to hitlers touring car  to eva brauns dark lipstick  to lovitz burning his tongue  culminating at a ceremony honoring world war ii veterans  rat races cast is first rate  cleese is wonderfully devilish and madcap  lovitz is  at first  a bit whiny  but his character grows on you  gooding is having a fine romp  and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleeses deadpan assistant  a man  born without a personality   the film is directed by jerry zucker  who knows something about comedy  along with his brother  david  and friend jim abrahams  he was responsible for such hits as airplane  and ruthless people  a throwaway subplot  which is good for some laughs  features cleese and his buddies  betting on a series of outlandish situations  including one dealing with a hooker and peptobismol  this is a fun little feature  the only letdown comes at the finale  which is too touchyfeely and sweet  almost negating what came before it  rat race is a summer sleeper  but it will keep you awake  as will the laughter of those watching around you  
0	if you have ever seen fox tvs special car chase programs  youll have a good idea about the content of ronin  the new action  thriller  from director john frankenheimer  the film involves a mysterious briefcase  that several groups of terrorist want to get their hands on  an irish women  dierdre  played by the truman shows natascha mcelhone   hires a group of mercenaries to assist her in getting the briefcase  among the people she hires are sam  robert de niro   vincent  jean reno   and gregor  stellan skarsg  rd from good will hunting   dierdres groups assignment is too seize the briefcase while the current owners are transporting it  they accomplish this task  but a traitor is in the bunch and the briefcase is soon on the run again  the briefcase stays on the run  as the movie leads the viewer through several plot twists that are badly executed  the writer seemed to be attempting to make a smart action movie  but failed to understand that just because there are surprises  it doesnt add too the credibility of a senseless script  the plot twists get no reaction because they come at a time where no one cares what is going on  after the apparent climax of the film  but to add to the excitement  as i mentioned earlier  there are endless car chase scenes  they are unrealistic and fail to add anything to the story  dont get me wrong  i love car chases  but they were overdone and too long here  we never do find out whats in the briefcase  but i doubt anyone cares by the time they finish sitting through this two hour long attempted thriller  
0	this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation  but lo and behold  here comes  switchback   and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as  kiss the girls  and  i know what you did last summer   but  switchback  is an undoubtedly weak genre entry  as the material it covers is old and tired  and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting    switchback  opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child shes watching  we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse  dennis quaid   and that the kidnapperkiller is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while  he is promptly removed from the case  but this conflict of interest doesnt keep him from offering pursuit  lacrosses most recent trek takes him to a bloodsoaked hotel room in amarillo  texas  where the local sheriff  r  lee ermey  is torn between his reelection campaign and helping his new ally catch his man  in a related aside  former railway worker bob goodall  danny glover  is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinupplastered  even on the seatbelts  el dorado  along the way  he picks up  and subsequently saves the life of  hitchhiking loner lane dixon  jared leto   this tangent isnt a random one  as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself  or is the villain in fact lacrosse  only pretending to be after the coldhearted murderer he knows so much about  in a sense  thats half of the basic problem with  switchback   for its first hour  the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator  so were given little insight into who they are  likely for fear that well learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction  but  switchback  then decides to explicitly reveal the killers identity at its midpoint  and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense  some of the acting is a burdensome area as well  probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves  what is danny glover doing here  grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot  and dennis quaid    that monotone  stop it   ermey is solid in a supporting role thats more interesting than the two leads thrown together  but the charismatic leto  claire danes object of affection in  my socalled life   is a scenestealer tried and true  from a material standpoint   switchback  is pretty empty  but even when firsttime director jeb stuart  who wrote  the fugitive  and  die hard   doesnt know what to do  he knows what he wants it to look like  the movie provides some great visuals  the setonatrain climax looks good  even though the action is illogical   and the beautiful  crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor  still  thats not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond  and more than the movies look will end up leaving you cold  
0	when considering david finchers latest film   the game   four words come to mind    dont believe the hype   this michael douglas vehicle  from the director of  seven   isnt nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe  the film draws us in with an intriguing concept  aided no doubt by the riveting trailer  where a jaded millionaire  douglas  is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy  this isnt simply virtual reality  this is real life with a deadly twist  on his 48th birthday  nicholas van orton  douglas  is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother  conrad  sean penn   conrad has a special birthday present for his brother  he hands nicholas a gift certificate and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services    they make your life fun   conrad tells him  nicholas humors his brother  telling him hell call  but its clear he has no time for any foolish   fantasy roleplaying   as he calls it  then  for reasons that are never really made clear  nicholas decides to go to crs and see what theyre all about  he ends up spending a whole day going through their screening process  which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have  nevertheless  when it seems nicholas has been rejected as a crs client  the weird things start happening  of course  when weve only covered about 30 minutes of screen time  what else should we expect  douglas has built his modern career around playing powerful  violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands  one of those films   basic instinct   came from the creative minds of writer  joe eszterhas and director  paul verhoeven  the premise of  the game   is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film   total recall   in that case  the premise was implanting someone elses memories as a way to enhance ones own life through a dream vacation  yet  in both films  the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience  we live the adventure along with the protagonist  reacting to each twist and turn  in theory  the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what isnt  all we can do is hang on until the end of the ride  when the truth is finally revealed  now  for those of you who forgot  let me say this again    dont believe the hype     the game  is not a thrilling roller coaster ride  as a suspensethriller  it doesnt do much but spin in circles  by the third reel  i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot  is it any wonder douglas wont be able to resist the charms of a mysterious  potentially lifethreatening blonde  ever heard of glenn close  no  well  how about sharon stone  thought so   if anything in this film surprises you at all  i would guess you havent seen that many films  there is no suspense here  trust me  i looked hard to find some  i had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations  fincher aims for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas  there are those that might say  the game  is not intended to be viewed literally  i would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film  the film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues  there is a moment early in the film where van orton  realizing his game has begun  smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out whos in on the whole thing  he is charged by his paranoia  he is looking at the world through new eyes  it is the last thoughtprovoking moment in the film  from there on  the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us  any significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device  at the outset  were told each  game  is tailored to the individual  ultimately  this  game  is supposed to work like a crucible  trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire  proving his soul  yet  as douglas endures his personal gauntlet  were given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is  i wanted to like this film more than i did  i look at it as just anothergreat idea  poorly realized  i can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didnt mean we were seeing what was really happening  bryan singers  the usual suspects  for one  a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas  also  there is the underrated  jacobs ladder   with tim robbins  a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism  here are two examples of films that dont simply manipulate for manipulations sake  there are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a meaningful place  one major issue that comes up in  the game  is whether or not the whole  illusion  is just a highly sophisticated con game  well  i can tell you right now  after youve spent your 7 dollars  you may be asking yourself the same thing

1	the smallscale film  in limited release   waking ned devine  is a pleasant excursion to a time and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of a small town  filled with breathtaking scenery  characters  and delightful music  the movie would be interesting even without a plot  the story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review  the film starts out with a sharp opening  which gives us a taste of what is to follow  country folk with an inclination for a bit of larceny  what gets things going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town  pop 52  of tullymore  who that person is  and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends jackie  ian bannen  and michael  david kelly   part detectives  part scalawags  they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as the story unfolds  the village consists of several amusing characters  a clueless pig farmer  temporary priest  and a witch  theres also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the upandup  there are no hollywood touches to this film  except for the outer space introduction     pacing is right  towards the end  it runs a bit out of steam  but thats okay because for most of the 90 minutes weve been interested in the goings on  a mixture of laughs and  occasional  sentiment  all the right emotions are engaged  in one brief dream sequence  youll know it when you see it  a fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to a place you really hope exists  one of the key moments in the film  the music  available on cd  london 289 460 9392  follows the same arc as the movie and is well worth considering  a fine film thats for everybody except action fans  somewhat like the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain      but livelier  
1	when casting the key part of the voice of moses  most peoples first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer  the saint and the island of dr  moreau   but he was dreamworkss choice in their first traditionally animated movie  the prince of egypt  the selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one  but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasnt in the casting department  the radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic  a la cecil b  demille  to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones  in the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children  animated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies  now that is something fresh  let me admit upfront that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off  dreamworkss antz seemed to be a movie not quite appropriate for any age group  the prince of egypt may be harder to market than antz  but it is much more satisfying  like antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixars a bugs life  the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices  danny glover is the voice of jethro  jeff goldblum of aaron  steve martin of hotep  helen mirren of the queen  michelle pfeiffer of tzipporah  martin short of huy and patrick stewart of seti  you can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god  the movie  which is weakest in the story department  is a cliffs notes version of demilles the ten commandments  the script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in mosess life  demille took over three and a half hours in order to do it justice  at less than half of that  the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it doesnt establish sufficient depth for us to bond with the characters  we meet moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket  we watch him grow up and become best bud and a chariot racing partner to ramses  ralph fiennes   the future pharaoh  moses is a free spirit and a practical joker until he finds out his true identity as a jew     all ive ever known to be true is a lie   moses complains   after finding out his real identity  he sees for the first time the oppression of the jewish slaves that are all around him  after leaving egypt  moses comes back to ask ramses to let mosess people go  this leads to the classic scene of the parting of the red sea  which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally handdrawn animation of the most of the production  it is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling  drawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses  blues and golds  the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last  the construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust  and other scenes are shot with the glow of a rising sun  the most original visual sequence in the film occurs during a dream moses has  done with an explicit twodimensional look  the colorful images painted on the temple walls come to life to tell their own animated story  even though it has its weaknesses  the prince of egypt is a noble attempt to carve out a new genre  serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family  this aweinspiring movie deserves to be seen  the prince of egypt runs about 1  30  it is rated pg for thematic elements and would be fine for the whole family  how old a kid would need to be to be interested depends on the child  but those over 8 will probably like it  
1	capsule  silly and inane adaptation of gibsons short story  which is nowhere in sight  gibsons script only adds insult to injury  johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie  i say  awesomely  because its one thing to fail  but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged  keanur reeves  who is terrible  stars as johnny  an  information courier  who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head  he is given  one last job   whenever you are in a movie and you hear those words  run   which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal  one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories  but its only followed up on in a token fashion  for his trouble  johnny gets chased by the yakuza  who seem to be the new bad guys in all the hightech thrillers  whats funny is that if you watch gangster movies made  in  japan  there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics  but of course theres no room in this movie for any of that  the yakuza are simply used to point guns  wave swords  flaunt tattoos  and grimace menacingly    i could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies  bound by honor  sugar hill and american me come to mind  when asians remain perpetually stereotyped  but thats another essay   anyway  johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark  why newark  maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york  thats why  there  he meets an assortment of odd characters  icet  dolph lundgren and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos   the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture  it turns out  what else   that the data in johnnys head could save a lot of people  but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesnt kill him  handled right  this could have been absorbing  but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity  the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other  better movies  blade runner and brazil come to mind  everything looks rundown and scummy  everyone dresses like theyre punk rockers  and videophones are commonplace  snore  the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future  complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves   but i kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively untechnical fellow would  think  it would look and behave like  a hacker of johnnys caliber would be blasting away with one commandline function after another  instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms  but of course thats not cinematic  whatever  what went wrong with this movie  gibson wrote his own screenplay  which i guess is part of the problem  what works as a short story doesnt work in a movie  his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot doesnt advance  it convulses  from the script on out  it was probably all downhill  renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless  theres no fun in kicking a wounded dog  is there  
1	these days  we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old  cult tv shows  most of the times  the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past  but  some five or six years ago  there werent that many movies and the trend didnt look that depressing  so  the people who  like the author of this review  grew up watching flintstones  popular 1960s animated series about  modern stone age  family  werent particularly worried when the word came about live action remake  after all  the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and  if anything else  at least the special effects would be good  the plot revolves about flintstones  family set in fictious stone age  town  of bedrock  whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america  fred flinstone  john goodman  works in the quarry  and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble  rick moranis  and his wife betty  rosie odonnell  to adopt a baby  to return the favour  barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred  and  based on that  fred gets wellpaid job in management  but  of course  this is just a sham  corrupt official cliff vandercave  kyle maclachlan  and his sultry secretary sharon stone  halle berry  need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme  in the meantime  freds wife wilma  elizabeth perkins  must face her mother  elizabeth taylor  who cant stand fred  on the superficial level  the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life  computer effects are flawless  and the costumes  settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show  unfortunately  problems with this film start with inadequate casting  rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney  while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie odonnell  but the greatest problem of all is plot  or to be precise  the lack of plot  some thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame  original characters onedimensional  and many elements of the story  like embezzlement and interoffice politics  totally incomprehensible for the little children  the main targeted audience of this film  result is almost unwatchable mess  occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting  elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma  and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as  high concept   after great hype  movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version  all in all  film isnt that bad  but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it  
1	the thoughtprovoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of  leila   a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui  that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirtyyear career to gain u  s  distribution  thanks to first run features  although unfamiliar with mehrjuis previous directing efforts  perhaps the reason for this is that  while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country  the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers  set in modernday iran   leila  begins on the birthday of the title character  leila hatami   after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband  reza  ali mosaffa   as leila and reza set off to visit his parents  and then hers  where a birthday celebration has been planned  things seem rosy for the couple on the outside  but for leila  life isnt quite as sweet  earlier  on that very same day  leila had gone to see her physician  and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child  when all of the conditions are ruled out  and leila passes up the possibility of adoption  reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her  and doesnt care at all about having children  nonetheless  leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby  which is the societal norm  and her selfesteem is not helped at all by her domineering motherinlaw  jamileh sheikhi   whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news  reza is her only son   bluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and  in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition  she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with  leila hesitantly agrees  and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens inadequacies  reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like  even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesnt give her full blessing  there are no easy answers to be found within  leila   a film that thoughtfully examines the central characters unfortunate plight  as well as the inner workings of leila herself  told through matteroffact narration  almost completely taken over by her own shame  she has no option but to agree to her forceful motherinlaws requests  even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman  maybe because  leila  is from iran  the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences  since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence  leila  however  is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily  but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy  no matter what the circumstances  one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza  who married only three months after their first meeting  but obviously love each other very deeply  it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful  and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible  although seemingly unimportant at first glance  an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing  nearly uncontrollably  actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half  as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another  ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday  and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her  these  small  moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn  outraging sequences in the latter half  in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road  and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman  left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage  foolishly unbeknownst to reza  leila prays each time that the date will not go well  so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer  refusing to stay over at her parents house  the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman  and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency  leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart  as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below  despite her initial agreement to such a thing  leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza  whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him  sure  the whole second marriage was his mothers idea  but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children  then he could have still easily backed out  couldnt he  in the pivotal role of leila  who appears in every scene  leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable  injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength  unavoidable vulnerability  and utter despair  unlike most american films  in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences  hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words  every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa  as reza  a man who  i believe  does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife  but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else  for all of its strong aspects   leila  isnt a perfect film  on a technical level  i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed  and concerning the plot developments  the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before  mehrjuis decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice  particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful motherinlaw  played memorably by jamileh sheikhi  despite these minor missteps   leila  is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new yorks cinema village  and then on may 21 in la  the thoughtprovoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales  and when the climax arrives  leilas selfworth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation  to which there is no return  its difficult to not consider how leilas culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided  had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila  the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme  was going through  
1	swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults  steven spielberg may not have directed  he only executive produced  but his touch certainly is evident in this movie  and he knows a money making winner when he sees one  the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster  big action  funny comedy  and the pacing of a rollercoaster  hopkins plays don diego de la vega  otherwise known as zorro  a fighter for the people  he is eventually captured by don rafael montero  stuart wilson   who also  unintentionally  kills his wife  the film cuts to twenty years later  where vega still wants to montero dead  however  hes far too old now  and trains up thief alejandro murrieta  banderas  to become the new zorro  banderas motive  to avenge the death of his brother  who was killed at the hands of captain love  matthew letscher  who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar  in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie  with the scene set  the movie goes on full blast  with sword fights aplenty and witty one liners  banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorros  playing each other off with ease  hopkins seems to come off a little better  but banderas does some excellent work  as the bad guys  wilson and letscher seem one dimensional  but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way  the audience does hate them  which cant be bad  catherine zetajones also pops up as hopkins daughter  and although she provides little more than the usual female lead  she delivers a charming  but one note  performance  the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones  theres a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight  and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed  until jones clothes fall off all together  the director  fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye  1995  handles the film perfectly  the action is well done and fast paced  the comedy put across well  the cast help a lot  but the direction is still outstanding  although the film is very long  the plot keeps chugging along  and theres barely a dull moment  however  the film is a little over indulgent  and it could have been trimmed  it manages to hold the attention  thankfully  and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel  screenwriters john eskow  ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script  although theyve bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action  the plot itself is barely existent  theres lots of little sub plots hanging around  but theres nothing substantial to bring them all together  the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to buy california using gold stolen from the guy hes buying the land off  this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines  however  this doesnt seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film  so the film is never quite sure where its going  in the end however  zorro provides action and comedy in spades  it suitable for everyone  so put the guilt behind  and put some more money into spielbergs bank account  you wont regret it  
1	there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review  not because of their own complexity  but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original  one of such masterpieces is casablanca  probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art  but definitely the most popular one  its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere  but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day  casablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience  one of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail  at least judging by conventional moviemaking wisdom of its time  it was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadnt been produced on stage  screenplay by three writers  julius g  epstein  philip j  epstein and howard koch  was beeing written as shooting went along  the main actors were producers second choice  and  finally  man behind camera  michael curtiz was considered to be capable  but not great director  however  the movie was commercially successful and earned three  oscars   including the one for the best film  until this very day  it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film making in its own golden age  the plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda  yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story  in december 1941  casablanca  exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral  yet nazicollaborating french vichy government  thousands of refugees from wartorn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america  and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas  many shady characters thrive on their misery  including the corrupt police chief  captain renault  rains   his best friend is rick blaine  bogart   who used to be idealistic antifascist  and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of  sticking his neck for nobody   however  everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas  this event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca  one of them is victor laszlo  henreid   czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe  he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund  bergman   with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris  the couple needs visas  especially because of the gestapo major strasser  veidt  being on their trail  rick is now forced to choose between love  wounded pride  selfpreserving interest and his own hatred of fascism  the casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration  humphrey bogart  most legendary actor in the history of cinema  is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status  bogarts portrayal of rick as complicated man  torn between idealistic past and bitter present  was so perfect  that his icon would forever be connected with that character  another icon in his company is ingrid bergman  great actress of old hollywood  here in her artistic and visual prime  the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking  some happier times when the romance on the screen didnt look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works  for many people  casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made  but the reason for that isnt the romance itself  its the realistic story of people forced to make tough  and often wrong choices in their life  the casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads  the supporting actors also did a marvellous job  sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic  john hustons maltese falcon  yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters  another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle  character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny  unfortunately  the charisma that burdened laszlo  leaves little place for difficult choice  making his character forever overshadowed by rickilsa coupling  however  rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca  captain renault  brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime  was embodiment of perfect  almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm  despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie  rains managed to make renault sympathetic character  and his final conversion to the side of good  symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary  rains also gave another dimension to the movie  making it even more ambiguous  people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renaults relationship towards rick  and ricks final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations  together with welldrawn characters and exciting story  the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere  professional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies  but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable  if not realistic  any way  even if we dont see it as a historical document  casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration  
0	originally launched in 1978  this popular film was reintroduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers  based on the mighty successful musical from broadway  grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2  6  510   starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles  plot  highschool musical set in the 1950s showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the tbirds  travolta  and the innocent and pure sandy olsen  newtonjohn  from australia  the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song  dance and humour  critique  funloving  energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler  this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950s  with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers  admittedly  i am somewhat biased in this opinion  since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth  grease was one of schmoes first bigscreen experiences  and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubblegum card collection   and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time  but apart from the nostalgic vibe  i was still extremely impressed by this film  as it continued to amuse me  despite my previous dozen or so viewings  this film took john travolta from a dimwitted  sweathog  on tvs welcome back kotter  and transformed him into a moviestar of spectacular proportions  saturday night fever  7  510  in 1979 confirmed that sudden popularity   unfortunately for the rest of the cast  his popularity was not terribly contagious  despite their effective showings in this classic movie  on the down side  some of the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn people off  like when sandy sings about  drinking lemonade  and  staying out until 10  with danny in  summer nights    and the plot isnt exactly the most elaborate storyline ever created  but despite these small reservations  this movie carries enough great music and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid 110 minute running time  and believe me    i am not a fan of the musicals     make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player  as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the films absolute highlights  and dont forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards  so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever youre feeling a little blue  little known facts  henry winkler  of tvs happy days fonzie fame  turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want to be typecast for the rest of his career  both travolta and conaway were smitten by newtonjohn during the filming of this picture  conaway eventually bowed out of the woofest  and married newtonjohns sister a year later  divorced after five years

0	  easely one of the worst films of the year    with the millenium just around the corner  hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century  this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil  the result is somewhat predictable  i didnt have high hopes about arnolds  much anticipated  return to the big screen  schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased  action lovers wont be bored  and the catholic league will be angry  everyone else will see end of days for what it is  a deliciously bad motion picture  think of it as hollywoods own y2k bug  did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 youll get 999  as in 1999  yes  you better believe it   satan is here on earth  working on his latest project  the end of days  this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and  although not al pacino  he is fun to behold  he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker  wreaking  as they say  havoc  the way it works is he smirks and something explodes  before the stroke of the new millennium hes got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations  only schwarzeneggers cop attached to an antiterrorist unit can stop him  films like this has one serious weakness  logic  no matter how you twist the  plot   youll find it incredibly stupid  even for a schwartzenegger movie    the incredible fact is that such directors never learn  after thousands of headless productions  this theme has become one big clich   here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution  he is walking around n  y   blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius  all he wants is the girl  that is somehow special  but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks  he has hidden her in a church  where satan dare not enter  so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information   you can have your wife and daughter back   i can give you happiness that you can only dream of   just give me the address    indeed with a script like that  you could make a wonderful parody  but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously  attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller  and for you who have awaited arnold swartzeneggers comeback  will not be very satisfied  weve not seen him in a while  thats because he didnt have a worthy opponent  he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars  he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop  so  after all those fights  whats left for arnold schwarzenegger  how about satan  in my opinion  he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in camerons  terminator   and that is schwartzeneggers strength  muscles and no emotions  here he tries to achieve an artistic level  moving towards the oscar  this is called  an adult turn  if successful and  a flop  if unsuccessful  make a wild guess  his character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems  this requires at least some acting skills  regrettably  the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles  the rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters  the movie is otherwise technically impressive  with a solid cinematography and fine lighting  but the movie doesnt serve neither as a serious thriller  because of its stupidity  nor as comic entertainment  because of its serious tone   the only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry  the action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular  so i really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody  unless you are a diehard schwartzenegger fan  stay away  as for schwarzenegger  hell be back

1	coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers  relentless  1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz  played by character actor leo rossi  spawned three more sequels  relentless 3  third in the row  features sam dietz again  but this time detective  who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case  doesnt want to deal with similar line of work  divorced  demoralised and transferred  he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer  and evidence indicate connection with one of dietzs old cases  to make things even more interesting  it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation  fans of the british tv films and miniseries like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies  they both feature vicious psychopathic killers  yet also give a lot of  usually depressive  details about chief investigators private lives  this one isnt an exception  but similarities with british television are only in content  the execution and style is different  which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best  useless  gratuitous erotica also doesnt help either  obviously making this film longer than it should be  the actors are good  though  leo rossi is fine as usual  and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career  signy coleman as dietzs love interest  is  on the other hand  quite miscast  but she wont have to worry about it in the future career  since relentless 3 wasnt supposed to be anybodys finest moment anyway  
0	seen september 5  1998 at 10 p  m  at the sony nickelodeon theaters  boston  ma   theater 2  with matt perreault for free using my sonyloews critics pass  theater rating    12  okay seats  sound  and picture modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before  from teenage sitcoms to nc17rated films about fetishes  the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it    your friends and neighbors  takes a different approach as its a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends  one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writerdirector neil labutes basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story  firstly  and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex  detailed story of lust  betrayal  arrogance  hypocrisy  greed  and just plain stupidity between six different characters  three men  three women   without hardly any supporting characters   a few have a line or two   mostly extras  everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come fullcircle back to themselves  whether it be positive or negative  but to just state this is arbitrary  and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult  labutes ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat  but whats specifically impressive is the fact the characters names are never revealed until the end credits roll  for the sake of this review  i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic  another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus  were always able to tell where the characters are  someones home  the gym  a restaurant  hotel room  etc    but what the city they live in  what year it is  what the society is like  etc  is relatively unknown  the film is a complete character study with the tight  intense drama of the theater  no one plot dominates the story  which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background  were simply dropped in on the characters lives and are expected to figure out the rest  the characters are a group of middleclass white people who are all successful at what they do  but theyre only concern right now seems to be their sex lives  first theres barry  eckhart  and mary  brenneman   a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who dont know what theyre problem is  barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife  and the sex they have  but doesnt have a lot of ambition  he just follows everyone else  mary is a writer of some sort  but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character  but ironically  doesnt hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something  labutes script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals  but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two  obviously  this is the theme  which is enhanced by the actors good performances  but at the same time seems just a bit hollow  another couple is jerry  stiller  and terri  keener  who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time  yet they constantly argue over anything and everything  their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship  if only one aspect of the film could use improvement  it would be this area  its natural for a married couple to become bored with each other  but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together  what did they ever see in the other person to begin with  labute never really answers  but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process  it still makes for good drama  tension  and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful its fascinating  two other characters act as catalysts  cary  jason patric  and cheri  natassja kinski   cary is an arrogant  hostile sexmaniac who defines the word  bastard   somehow he is able to bend women to his will  either through charm or just attitude  into getting his way  hes the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize hes secretly perverted  but somehow barry finds comfort in his company  although jerry is always nervous around him  patric gives an outstanding performance  so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is  cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her  she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film  each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different  from becoming involved in a relationship with one  to brushing it off as small talk with another  to being outright appalled by yet another  shes a sweet woman  perhaps the most normal of any of the characters  and although her symbolism is obvious  her role as the outsider is the most relatable  i will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others action  as thats the hook of the film  the first two acts begin to set up the characters and eachs scenarios  but its often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom  the result is sometimes surprising  other times predictable  but the actual course of actions is always fascinating  for a while everyone has their fun  but ultimately each characters guilt  attitude  or ignorance will disserve them  one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be  since the characters only interact with each other there isnt much pop culture references  as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it  are we to assume that these people are  as the title states  our friends and neighbors  i dont know of anyone going through the same situations as these people  often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama  other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie  but what this film does have that the others dont is repercussions in the end  although the film creates its own reality  it goes to show that even the immoral arent immortal  in what way  your friends and neighbors  is supposed to work is open to interpretation  it definitely has a lot

1	the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john mayburys love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon  as always  jacobis acting is impeccable  but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque  the movie convincingly argues that francis  played by jacobi  was a completely despicable and vain individual  but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude  when interviewed by a fawning talk show host  francis calls his style  chance brushstrokes   starting with a burglary of franciss flat  the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie  the camera shots are heavy on the avantgarde angles  lots of wideangle closeups and distorted shots filmed through coloredglass reflections  the director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being a sterile examination of a lonely and vain man  daniel craig  in a lifeless performance  plays the burglar and boxer  george dyer  when francis lays eyes on him after the breakin  francis promises not to call the police if hell stay for sex  he stays for the entire movie but never respects the man with whom he shares a bed  he thinks that franciss paintings have  no bloody use   and the movie presents no counterargument  writer maybury barely outlines franciss character  and george and the rest of the supporting cast remain a complete enigma  we learn little of george other than franciss reason for liking him  georges  amorality and innocence   franciss love of sadomasochism is shown early and often    boxing is such a marvelous aperitif for sex   he reflects to george on the way to watch a boxing match  as the fighters head is sliced open with a heavy blow  the camera cuts to a gleeful francis whose own head is soaked by the flying blood  francis appears to be in complete ecstasy  another of franciss favorite activities is viewing old movies of atrocities  as the carnage mounts  we witness an orgasmically happy francis in the audience  in a film that tries obsessively to shock  one dream sequence portrays a family in a car accident  franciss mind slowly examines every bloody limb of the mother  the father  and the boy  sometimes the script throws us tidbits of franciss wisdom which illuminate little while merely sounding insightful     im optimistic by nature  im optimistic about nothing     loneliness is my only true companion    we learn more details about franciss makeup techniques than about the man himself  he prefers shoe polish for his hair and sink cleaning powder for his teeth  full of metaphorical interpretations  the films best scene occurs late one night when george has to get up to go to the bathroom  mistaking franciss picture of a toilet for the genuine article  he urinates on it and then crawls back into bed contentedly  like a parody of a bad art house movie  love is the devil has horrid characters filmed bizarrely and confusingly by a director who is much more interested in technique than storytelling  by the end  the audience hasnt learned any more than it could have in a threeminute sketch  love is the devil runs 1  30  the film is not rated but should be considered nc17 for violence  profanity  graphic sex  nudity and sadomasochism and is unacceptable for most teenagers

1	titantic  writer and director james camerons much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed 200  000  000 epic  arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises  whether the film is worth it  as a business proposition  it seems hard to see how it can ever break even  but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful  if youve already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure  think again  the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the worlds most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers  in either case  it is filmmaking at its best  when we entered the press screening  my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long  he said no but that the time would go by so fast shed never notice the length  amazingly  he was right  titanic is one of the few long films that doesnt suffer because of it  the lush picture  filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm  opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean  fortune hunter brock lovett  bill paxton  leads the expedition looking for the worlds most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship  known back then as  the ship of dreams   the necklaces hundredyearold former owner  rose dewitt bukater  gloria stuart   finds brock to tell him her story  although almost all of the movie happens in flashback  one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk  using a computer simulation  the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later  which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing  after twenty minutes  the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage  in a classic movie theme  the two parts of the ship  first class and steerage  thirdclass  exist in sharp contrast  the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing  entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance  cal hockley  played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane  and thanks to a last minute winning poker hand  an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class  even with her own promenade deck  rose feels trapped on the ship  what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes  in contrast  jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board  after jack saves rose from committing suicide  they start a brief but impassioned love affair  never tawdry and rarely explicit  their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story  leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma  in so many ways  small and large  he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part  when he confronts cal  for example  he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cals supercilious putdowns  kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose  the chemistry between these two academy award nominees  him for whats eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility  is nothing short of astonishing  from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ships bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude  they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances  if the film breaks after an hour and a half  which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up  you will still get one of the best films of the year  peter lamonts sets are more than authentic  one scene  for example  starts with the planningtoretire captain  played with insouciance by bernard hill  having his tea on deck  it then shifts to the ships massive gears and then to the brighthot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals  the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner  easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest  at first  since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull  not some big gaping hole  the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else  what a lark  weve struck an iceberg  now lets get back to our brandy and cigars  the ships musicians play like troopers through it all  even after the panic sets in  after all  they see it as their duty to calm the passengers  when the musicians are about to die  they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together  and they mean it  their civility borders on insanity  but it is touching nevertheless  the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface  there are more than enough characters to love and to hate  and all of the casting is deadon  special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable  in titanic  for which he created a ninetenths scale model of the entire ship  cameron strove for accuracy at all costs  the most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two  and the front section becomes vertical in the water  people are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately  besides being romantic and dramatic  the script includes liberal doses of humor  from the many deliciously subtle verbal putdowns to the physical comedy  as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man  the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears    its goodbye for a little while   a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first    this boats for mommies and children  therell be a boat in a little while for daddies   basically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats  it made the decks look too crowded otherwise  perhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheims onboard the ship  in the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink  he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew    no thanks   the elegantly attired guggenheim replies    were dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen  but we would like a brandy   titanic runs 3  14  it is rated pg13 for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up  
1	it is simply amazing how  the green mile  developed in its three hour running time  based on the stephen king series of the same title  the film starts out painfully slow  with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue  however  as the plot begins to progress  the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction  frank darabont  who masterfully followed a prisoners story in  the shawshank redemption   this time follows the perspective of a prison guard  paul edgecomb  tom hanks   through edgecombs experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent  the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law  from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner   the green mile  is successful in creating sympathy for kindhearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners  the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them  the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb  the ensemble acting in the film is perfect  hanks  david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles  they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles  they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience  the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting  some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson  sam rockwell  and michael duncan  hutchinson  playing percy wetmore  a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie  every time he appears on the screen  the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying  it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor  not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore  but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks  rockwell  an independent film veteran  plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection  as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours  he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others  this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable  the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan  as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill  duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened childlike behemoth  very similar to lennie small in of mice and men  his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause  his pain creates pain for the viewer  however  it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film  the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at  the jerry springer show   the scene  containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks  not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place  but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief  as the film flashes back to 1935  graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction  his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is  the scene is neither sad nor convincing  greene is not even given a final word  like some of the other characters  and we dont even see him walk the infamous green mile  however  as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters  such as coffey and eduard delacroix  michael jeter  as well as the five prison guards  the film becomes more interesting  the speed in  the green mile  is perfect  if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark  it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others  the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film  a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character    the green mile  is so good following the rough beginning  that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes  it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene  fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing  if you survive the first third of  the green mile  sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment  
1	all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos  please raise your hands  thank you for identifying yourselves  now would you all please go away  your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade  and it shows no sign of abating any time soon  it isnt just the strobe light quality of your twentycutsperminute editing  or the numbing overuse of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised  featuring the music of     no  it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected  banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles  welcome to the club  scott kalvert  your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and onedimensional  serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole  dicaprio stars as jim carroll  the new york poetsongwriter performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based  as the film opens  jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey  mark wahlberg   pedro  james madio  and neutron  patrick mcgaw   one night  jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine  and shortly thereafter to heroin  jims addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral  as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach  bruno kirby   kicked out of his home by his mother  lorraine bracco   and drops out of school  along with mickey and pedro  jim becomes a victim of the street  living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower  the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years  but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner  screenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carrolls posse  resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic  but now with equally unsympathetic friends  as a film  the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale  a 100 minute long  just say no  public service announcement  but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie  jim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie  but i suppose that his pseudosensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out  perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those  good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd  that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be  i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd  without a character who changes in any appreciable way  the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strungout cohorts  all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack  director scott kalvert doesnt have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work  so he substitutes silly slowmotion photography  selfconsciously funky camera angles and choppy editing  on only one occasion  when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in  are any of the gimmicks effective  mostly  they just draw attention to how hollow the story is  they also dont allow leonardo dicaprios performance to be as strong as it could have been  for every impressive moment  like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money  there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics  dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors  particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an exjunkie who tries to help jim straighten out  but kalvert wont let character interaction define this story  he wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star  shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting  at isolate moments  the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprios talents  far more frequently  it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like  
1	airplane  is considered among many to be the epitome of satire filmmaking  after all  its brought to us by one of the best known satire writingdirecting teams  even if most people dont recognize the names behind the films  they are bound to recognize the titles  airplane   top secret  the naked gun  and hot shots to name a few  but although the zuckerabrahamszucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977  airplane  remains the true cornerstone of their work  and their directorial debuts  in the seventies  disaster films seemed to be at an all time high  films like earthquake  the towering inferno  and the poseidon adventure were big hits  there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane  a series that spanned the entire decade  and so  in 1980  we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film  this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean      it had to do with bad fish  airplane  is the story of ted striker  robert hays   an exfighterpilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six  er  seven comrades  unable to stop living in the past  teds world fell apart  he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job  and eventually  as we begin this film  is getting dumped by his lover  flight attendant elaine dickinson  julie hagerty   in a desperate attempt not to lose her  ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working  unfortunately  she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her  which leaves him wallowing in selfpity  in the midst of it all  something happens  someone gets sick  then another  then another  soon  the whole plane is full of deathlyill chicagobound people      and when the pilots get sick  played by peter graves  kareem abduljabbar  and frank ashmore   who will save the day    gee  i wonder  of course the main draw here is the nonstop  whizbang  comedy  with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags  although i had seen this movie a few times before  i was still laughing thru the entire thing  the most fun character by far is the doctor  played by leslie nielsen  hes a dry  subtle  sterotypically straightfaced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film  in a film like this  youre not really expecting an elaborate production  so one cant complain about the amateurish quality  what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny  played by stephen stucker  this character is pointless  nauseating  and very unfunny  i dont know why he was put in there  and i dont think anybody will find a good excuse  and when the film nears an end  it slows down quite a bit  almost getting old  you gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long  aside from that  airplane  is really a topnotch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic  it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends  especially if they havent seen it  and if they ask what the plot is  just tell em  its a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film  but thats not important right now   if youve seen the film  youll understand    
0	director luis mandokis last film was the superb  serious 1994 drama  when a man loves a woman   but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture   message in a bottle   which is the worst type of romance  a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up  everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times beforeand much betterso theres an absence of suspense  and the film ultimately moves at such a very  very deliberate pace  as if it is trying to make great   meaningful  statements and plot developments  that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through    message in a bottle  begins with theresa osborne  robin wright penn   a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune  whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day  inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine  and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and  to her objection  finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper  soon  a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message  and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake  theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks  a boating town in north carolina  to find out the specifics of the message  of course  garrett turns out to be a handsome  rugged man around theresas age and played by kevin costner  she is immediately charmed by him  but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there  and finds that catherine was garretts late wife who died a few years earlier  do you think you know where this is headed  most likely you do  and i wouldnt call it giving away anything to say that by the pictures end  the movie has fallen into deep  artificial melodrama that i didnt buy for a second  if there are any positive things to say about  message in a bottle   it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman  as garretts stubborn  but loving father  are far above par to be in such a wasteful   shaggy dog  love story  and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast  and paints chicago as an equally alluring city  meanwhile  costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the lessthanstellar films that he has made recently  it seems that with such bad luck  he wouldnt want to make another movie set near water  but here he is again with one of the main  and most ridiculous  centerpieces set on a stormswept sea  the other actors are all  sadly  wasted  including illeana douglas  an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the  friend  roles  here playing penns confidante and coworker at the tribune  the first half of  message in a bottle  plays like a humdrum  trite television movie for the lifetime channel  as theresa spends a great deal of time  getting to know  garrett  with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining  usually  i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogueladen sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships  but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt  written   and not as if people were really  talking   when the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other  and are not particularly interesting themselves  you know immediately that you are in trouble  i swear that while watching  message in a bottle   i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater  heck  in actuality im not even familiar to the novel this is based on  by nicholas sparks   always one step ahead of the characters  the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the triedandtrue hollywood melodrama  the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing  nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresas secret  and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after  this same exact problem occurred in last years very  very similar  watch this  and you will realize just how similar i mean  meg ryannicolas cage romantic drama   city of angels   although theresa is deeply touched by the  heartfelt  letter that she finds in the bottle  perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own  preferably before filming began  it should have read   memo to screenwriters  use you brain   
1	hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell  the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films  in a nutshell  the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous  with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership  a lot of hong kongs best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u  s  productions  such talents as jackie chan  rush hour   chow yunfat  anna  the king  the corrupter  and yuen wooping  the matrix  have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results  now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai  unfortunately  romeo must die  bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kongs rhythms  the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking  enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing  russell wong   kai confronts po sing  jon kit lee   the son of kais boss and leader of the local chinese family  a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai  who handily kicks and punches his opponents down  its not until club owner silk  rapper dmx   bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends  the following morning po sing is found dead  suspicions escalate  as issac oday  delroy lindo  is told of the murder  his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture  issac implores his chief of security  mac  issiah washington  to watch after his son and daughter  the scene shifts to a prison in china  where han sing  jet li  learns of his brothers murder  he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined  hung upside down by one foot  han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work  escaping to the u  s  han sets out to find the person responsible for his brothers death    romeo must die  is in many ways a fun film  it is both absurd and assured  the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes  the godfather   the relationship between jet lis han and aaliyahs trish oday reminds us of abel ferreras  china girl   except that romeo must dies couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another  their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history  the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable  li  of course has the showiest part  having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination  allayah  in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace  its obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic  but  still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it  delro lindo as issac oday carries himself well in the film  an unsung and under appreciated actor  mr  lindo turns out the films best performance  the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d  b  woodside as issacs son  colin  the performance is undirected  with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in  an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and  or better written  first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film  having a career as one of the industrys best cinematographers  bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots  and  romeo must die  does look good  but the pacing of the film is lethargic  only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes  the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in  the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing  and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayahs bodyguard  maurice has no comic timing whatsoever  the best things about the film are its fight scenes  jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles  one needs only to see his film  fist of legend  to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat  here  jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that  lethal weapon 4   jets u  s  debut  didnt allow  unfortunately  a lot of jets fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision  also  romeo must die  must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film  and that is an xray effect that appears three times during the course of the film  showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent  obviously a homage to the famed xray scene from sonny chibas  streetfighter   the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film  its as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted  one problem though about the fight scenes  those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon  they do have an internal rhythm to them  a heartbeat  so to speak in their choreography  the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance  this is created by the performance  the direction and the editing  here in  romeo must die   there is no staccato  every fight scene  even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern  the rhythm is monotonous  a hong kong film has a tempo that changes  heightening its emotional impact  rmd is limited to a standard 44 tempo  not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever  a fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chans films   watch the restaurant fight from the film  rush hour  and notice that the context of the fight  while technically amazing is rather flat  the framing and cut always do not help   now look at the warehouse fight from  rumble in the bronx   there you have a heartbeat  and emotional draw that doesnt let the audience catch its breath  the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly  causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted  here in romeo must die  the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl  jet li is a grand and personable screen presence  its a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here  one day filmmakers here in the u  s  will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity  until then  well be left with emotionally hollow product like  the replacement killer  and  currently  romeo must die   
0	the skulls is a laughably bad thriller  a teenorientated doppelganger of the firm so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor  certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter  i chuckled incessantly  all the way home  let me share  the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale  designed  im sure  to mirror the actual skull  bones from the same college   luke mcnamara  joshua jackson   a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year  highlights the latest skull scouting report  despite some anxiety and caution from others  luke accepts entry into the organization  soon after  he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women  driving a new car and marveling at the 20  000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account  yeah  dude  pretty good deal eh  but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating  when circumstances become extreme  there is no way he can leave the society  except maybe as a drooling vegetable  the premise  although lacking in originality  certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense  unfortunately  the skulls is neither intriguing  nor suspenseful  nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting  its just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack  the stars     but not the script  the skulls is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value  with the screenplay  by jon pogue  immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers  first off  upon their initiation into the skulls  each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm  afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar  will they never take this watch off  and what if they forget it by their bedside  perhaps their  secret society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed  on top of this  they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters  gee  why not member tshirts  but my favorite bit is this  the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual  agree or  disagree notions when making collective decisions  they are given official skull paddles  when flipped to one side  they indicate the member agrees with the proposal  facing the opposite way means a disagreement  wouldnt they merely express themselves verbally  hell no  they have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote  and maybe afterward they can play pingpong  im still chuckling about these ludicrous details  but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest  the cast  meanwhile  combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the dawsons creek crowd  and fuses the two together  ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout  but not entirely  accomplished actors like craig t  nelson  as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake  and william peterson  as fellow board member senator levritt  are dealt pathetic villain caricatures  and look suitably embarrassed handling them  and then theres christopher mcdonald  who has the capacity to be a fun  exciting actor  mcdonalds charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role  yes  pogue makes it a hattrick   i pray it was a snatchthepaycheckandrun exercise for all these actors  the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better  lets cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character  paul walker  the strapping quarterback from varsity blues  is bland but passable as caleb mandrake  the judges son  walker preserves a straight face  even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie  dad  i just killed a guy in the ritual room     some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb  who plays lukes longtime chum chloe  and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics  it really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one  or maybe not minute one  thanks to a decent setup from director rob cohen  who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere and style  it makes you wonder why he didnt flee indefinitely from the project  because while enjoyable cheese like dragonheart and the moderate stallone thriller daylight arent superior cinema  they belong on the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash  aside from unintentionally humoring the audience  the skulls gets little accomplished  the thrills and action are lazy and mechanical  the story is stuffed with ridiculous  formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick  instead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization  we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage  weve seen it all before  and better  the skulls is a feeble little circus of stupidity  so miscalculated that  while it would serve as a clever pun  a term like  boneheaded seems just too generous  
1	what were they thinking  nostalgia for the seventies is bad enough  but do we really need an eighties film  robbie hart  adam sandler  used to want to be a rock and roll star  but in 1985 hes singing at weddings and having a good time  a romantic at heart  he loves weddings and is just about to get married to his highschool sweetie  when she leaves him waiting at the altar  his tune changes to  love stinks   he meets waitress julia  drew barrymore  who is engaged to a junkbonds salesman and you know that they are going to get together  in fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movie  sandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role  but there is no spark  barrymore doesnt seem to be able to convey anything other than a pretty face with nothing behind it  beauty but no attitude  both characters are just there  bit parts by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show  the eighties are shoved in our face  references to deloreans  madonna   dallas   ivana and donald  burt and loni and  miami vice  get old fast  the filmmakers must have realized that there wasnt much entertainment to the story and thought they could dazzle the audience with humorous period allusions  theyre not funny and it doesnt work  with change on all fronts accelerating more and more  nostalgia appears to have a great appeal  but dont you think we could have more than 14 years before we yearn for the past  maybe we can look forward to a film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino    michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and he knows that nostalgia is not what it used to be

1	ugh  that about sums this movie up  just  ugh  the original godzilla movies are somewhat of a cult classic  and when reviewing the previous films  each film had a certain degree of intelligence  and that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following  in spite of bad special effects  horrible dubbing  and a man in a lizard suit  they maintained a certain degree of    how to put this     dignity  not quite the word im looking for  you understand  right  and in 50 years  godzilla has maintained that degree of whatever  leave it to america to screw the whole thing up  from the geniuses that brought us  independece day   arguably the worst scifi movie of all time  to ruin whatever reputation godzilla had  while they do bring us eyepopping special effects that will amaze you  they lost what was at the center of all the original godzilla movies  a storyline  summing up the movie is simple  heck  i can do it in one sentence  giant lizard attacks a giant city and a bunch of nobodies stop it  simple as that  matthew broderick stumbles over his lines  and its hard to picture hank azaria in any role besides his classic dogwalking character on the television show  mad about you   the dialogue seems to be improvized  almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all  i can see the scene on the set right now    all right  we spent all of this money making big special effects  and weve gotta get this movie out by summer or its going to bomb in our faces  so  you actors just say what ever comes to the top of your head  all right  make up something  mkay  good  roll film    the special effects are enough to keep you interested through one viewing  and some of the cinemtography is welldone  the scene with the black umbrellas comes to mind   still  an hour into it  you will become antsy  wondering how long they can drag it out  and drag it out they do   i have to laugh  the slogan for the film is   size does matter   i think they cut this too short  it should read   size does matter  acting does not   
1	john von neumann  progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project  pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos  even without recourse to fasterthan light travel  you send out selfreplicating robot ships which explore and radio back information  it may take decades  centuries  or millennia  but it can be done with achievable technology  and doesnt require a magical fasterthanlight drive  in the fifties  british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it  any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer  which would then engage in a realtime dialog with the aliens  exchanging information and technologies  and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned  about thirtyfive years ago  the bbc contracted with astronomerwriter fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a miniseries called a for andromeda  afa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission  the construction of a huge computer  the computers analysis of life on earth  and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication  she was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the thenunknown julie christie  audience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel  andromeda breakthrough  which played to equally high ratings  dennis feldman  whose previous credits include the golden child  has never been noted for coherent  wellstructured movie scripts  they start out great  and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action  mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl  feldman writes good scenes  but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie  even with a previous version to use as a model  now  in species  we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline  derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter  gore  and chases  species features ben kingsley  who is completely wasted in a badlywritten portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist  forest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script  the species story is relatively simple  we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971  and have been receiving answers for two years    note that  in the 1970s  we really didnt know diddly about the human genome structure  and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings  even today  all we can do is give information about dna and how it works  not a copy of human dna  because we dont have it analyzed yet   the answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race  and doctor xavier finch  played by ben kingsley  is placed in charge of the attempt  the script begins to go off the deep end at this point  when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shapeshift into any of several ugly alien life forms  the first half of the film has something to offer  as  sil   the alien girl  struggles with her multiform existence  changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again  all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos  she seems oddly knowledgeable about human society  with glaring gaps where her social skills should be  her instincts are to mate and procreate  and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area  escaping from her birth laboratory in utah  sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her  she goes on an eating binge  spins herself a cocoon  and emerges as an adult  played by natasha henstridge  who goes a long way toward recreating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960  the pursuers  michael madsen is an assassinexterminator  forrest whitaker is a convenient empathpsychic  just as though the u  s  government actually had such people on call  neither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided  whitakers role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek  the next generations  counselor cleavage   the other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina  kingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals  too good to not work to the best of their abilities  but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland  and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak  h  r  gigers design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it  although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly  the main fault of species is lack of originality  it starts out with a wonderful  albeit borrowed  premise  and then doesnt live up to it  all we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes  with a few monsters tossed in  there is no buildup of tension and suspense  no climax worthy of the name  species is just a sequence of  scare  scenes stuck together  the movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes  but not rescued by them  on the other hand  as an exercise in scifi action adventure  it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd  species earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board  but by and large  its fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing  my personal rating is three stars  but knock one or two of those off if you dont enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters  mpaa classification  r  violence  gore  nudity  sex

1	battlefield long  boring and just plain stupid battlefield earth a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman in my midteen years  i had a horrendous reoccurring nightmare  behind the wheel of a car  i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert  no scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway  no matter what i did  the view didnt change  travelling but not getting anywhere  each time i awoke in a sweat  terrified  you dont have to be carl jung to understand that dream  powerless to make changes  trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue  this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake  this is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after  battlefield earth  begins  for all of its flash and style  l  ron hubbards science fiction epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of 2000  dull  and  stupid  in the year 3000  the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for 1  000 years  humans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians  theres no hope  the future is bleak  then the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler  barry pepper  who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl  john travolta  and the alien race  its an archetypal postapocalyptic plot full of promise  considering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen  its difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably  but it does  the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits  are we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold  the psychlo never discovered fort knox  or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time  and gassed up  or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships  or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow dont notice that their slaves are missing for days  travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all hes worth and is almost entertaining  almost  the rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person   mananimal  or not  would ever utter  some of the film looks good  but it also looks so familiar  a race of large hulking apelike creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin  sound like something charlton heston might be in  the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from  dune   the final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their hightech city is something george lucas might have been associated with  its too loud  its too oppressive  its too slow  its too long    far too long  and on it goes  the list of the problems with  battlefield earth  is endless  its difficult to find anything in the film that does work  oh yeah  the color scheme is nice  the real question is how this movie ever got made  could it have something to do with the fact that l  ron hubbard was the founder of scientology  and that john travolta is a member of the church  that might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago  but it doesnt give us a clue as to why firsttime screenwriter corey mandells atrocious script was used  or why the highprofile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed a major film  or why no one looked at this thing before it was released and realized there might be problems  the one bright spot is that no longer will kevin costners  the postman   which i begrudgingly admit as a guilty pleasure  be  the  big budget science fiction failure    battlefield earth  has the honor sewed up  often reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films and wait for the video  thats not the case here  you can act now and make the decision to not see it on the big screen or on the small one  dont hesitate  strike now while the iron is cold

1	if youve seen the trailers or commercials  its rather difficult to really figure out what this movie has in store  well  its hard to tell after watching the movie as well  bruce willis is a resident of the future  and it is a rather bleak future  the worlds population had disintigrated into a mere 200  000 and is no longer ruled by humans but animals  the reason  in 1995  an organization called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated the world with a pure virus  thus wiping out practically the worlds population in a mere month  bruce willis character is one of the surviving few  but is enslaved by scientists  as are most of last living humans  they barter his freedom by sending him on an assignment and having him do the ultimate task  go into the past  find the leader of the army of the 12 monkeys  and kill him  well  this explanation didnt come easy  although the movie is very thought provoking of us as a people  our future and the evilo in the world  as a story it is very confusing  and dragging  i know a movie isnt keeping my interest when i fidget in my seat or feel the need to look at my watch only to find that its only been an hour passed  terry gilliam has a certain style that i realize many appreciate  and i havent watched his previous work brazil  but this movie felt like it took too long to tell and yet when one realizes the end is near because it is very easy to figure out  you wish it were more complex  and not to mention that the movie is depressing is the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me  
1	studio expectations must not have been high for  great expectations   the films release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute  therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999  its actually a smart move  because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale isnt quite oscar fodder  it  is  strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year    great expectations  also demonstrates how to modernize a classic story right  especially after the excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmanns  william shakespeares romeo  juliet     great expectations  opens somewhere in 1970s florida  the original story is set in 19thcentury england   as eightyearold finn  jeremy james kissner  meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on his life in the future  theres icy  11yearold estella  raquel beaudene   a pseudoplaymate of finns  ms  dinsmoor  anne bancroft   estellas auntie whos quite offkilter over a past romance that never took off  and a mysterious prisoner  robert de niro  whom finn saves the life of  finn  who lives with his sisters affable boyfriend  lone stars chris cooper   fancies himself an aspiring artist  and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms  dinsmoors lipstick  eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion  flash forward into the 90s  after a brief stop in the 80s   and finn  now played by ethan hawke   despondent over a strange hotandcold relationship with the elusive estella  gwyneth paltrow   receives quite a bit of money from an unknown benefactor  its enough cash to send him to new york to focus on a career in art  there  finn seems to gain everything he could ever want  wealth  prestige and a high place in the glamorous art world  when estella resurfaces  albeit with an aloof fianc   hank azaria   finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction  but shes not the only ghost from finns past thats going to be paying him a visit  comparisons with the aforementioned  romeo  juliet  seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a current setting    great expectations  is a much better venture  though  because it treats its source with evenhanded respect  where  romeo  was never quite sure whether to be a spoof  a homage or both  the movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezkis sexy cinematography  notably  he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious  erotic charge thats steamier than the films  surprisingly muted  love scenes  the eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the onscreen action beautifully  especially new songs by tori amos  mono and duncan sheik  acting credits are firstrate  often hiding the screenplays occasional slipups  hawke is sincere and solid as a leading man  something we also learned from  gattaca    and his finn is quite a likeable guy  paltrows estella  on the other hand  is rather underdeveloped  while the actress is at her icily seductive best  were not told very much about her character  and as a result  its often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level  but  oh   what  a physical level   sometimes  we root for finn although we dont quite understand why shes fueling his fire  robert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play  on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft  a macabre  throaty delight who mambos and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealous  alfonso cuarons visually elegant direction helps to distract from the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movies climax  another problem is predictability  you can guess your way through the plot even if you arent familiar with the story  despite its script flaws  though   great expectations  is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy  and frankly  its nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality  perhaps that renovated release date  awfully close to valentines day  will end up helping  great expectations   seemingly average box office chances after all  
0	  i seem to have glued myself    to myself   starring jason biggs  seann william scott  chris klein  thomas ian nichols  allyson hannigan  shannon elizabeth  natasha lyonne  tara reid  mena suvari  eugene levy  jennifer coolidge  directed by j  b  rogers  rated r  american pie 2 reunites the cast members from american pie in a different setting  instead of being high school seniors looking to score before they graduate  they are now past their first year of college and have gathered in a beach house to enjoy the summer of their lives  jim  jason biggs  is still an insecure geek looking to improve his performance  oz  chris klein  is still the sweetest guy on the block  having sickeningly saccharine phone conversations with his studyingabroad girlfriend  stifler  seann william scott  is still a horny stoner  kevin  thomas ian nichols  still has no personality and finch  eddie kaye thomas  still longs for stiflers mom  have i missed anyone  so  obviously  not much has changed  this is not a problem  provided that the movie boasts the rapidfire hilarity and unexpectedly true sentiment of the original  but american pie 2 is the very definition of  sequelitis   its coarser  yes  and it pushes the envelope even more  but its heart isnt in it  its easy cash to capitalize off the first films success  but it would have been a worthier investment to prolong the franchise by coming up with something original  part of the reason why the film doesnt work  i think  is that while in the original the kids quest for sex was a comingofage stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness  here  everything has been cheapened  they behave like those idiot frat boys who kill themselves drinking  they have no motivation except for sex  sex  beer and sex  thats not to say that you cant make a decent comedy from that premise  but it is one of american pie 2s undoings  missing  too  is the sweetness that permeated american pie  the thiscouldbeyou quality of the main players  here  the characters are too aware of themselves as popculture icons  and theyre even more onenote  stifler and finch are now caricatures while jim  oz and kevin are forced to make awkward selfdiscoveries at arbitrary moments  none of them betraying what the writers think the audiences want to see  and then theres the soontobenotorious scene where jim superglues  himself to himself   which perfectly demonstrates yet another of the films ailments  one that also permeated say it isnt so  director j  b  rodgers debut  theres a fine line between comedy and abject humiliation  and american pie 2 is on the wrong side of it  its hard to laugh at the characters when you are profoundly embarrassed for them  i shielded my eyes watching this more than i have watching any horror movie  if theres one redeeming factor to american pie 2  its the inimitable eugene levy as jims dad  who pops in on jim as hes about to score and utters lines like  your mother and i have been known to get frisky    not so much anymore  but     and then when the girls parents walk in  blurts out  this must be your daughter  i didnt get her name  but hopefully my son did   if only the rest of the movie had the wit and wisdom of levys performance  this is an unworthy sequel to a grossfest that brought back the raunchy teen comedy  the boxoffice of this onw should keep the genre going strong  which is disappointing  the genre needs a hiatus  filmmakers are getting lazy  
1	i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard  the problem is  i cant remember them as i write this review  thats not a good sign  in booty call  jamie foxx is bunz  a character whom i cant really describe  because i dont know that much about him  i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk  and that he doesnt like relationships  just  booty calls  at three in the morning  no questions  no commitment   bunz has a best friend named rushon  tommy davidson   who seems to be bunzs direct opposite  on the straight and narrow  and currently in a longterm commitment  a whole seven weeks  wow    rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend  nikki  tamala jones   but for a reason which is not totally explained  its going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikkis friend lysterine  vivica a  fox   who have never met  to make a long story short  the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikkis obsession with safe sex  first she wants condoms  so bunz and rushon go out and get them  oh  no  they have to be latex  not lambskin  back to the store  now theyve got to get dental dams  or therell be no foreplay  why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand  nikki phones lysterine  who lives across the hall  and tells her shed better be making these demands  too  talk about coitus interruptus  booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those overthetop comedies  the difference between the two is that in the latter  things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality  in this category  for example  you have ace ventura  private eye on the mild side  and airplane  at the extreme  there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status  but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention  it is disappointing  and even worse  distracting  there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker  are those real names   does not live up to its potential  as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing  for instance  there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant  bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese  much to everyones surprise  however  when asked how he learned the language  he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from latenight kungfu films  and soon gained mastery  this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene  if  on the other hand  when asked how he learned to speak chinese  bunz simply replied with   kungfu movies   and then moved on  the joke would have been much more effective  this is because it would have been totally unbelievable  but funny because we know it is unbelievable  by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible  the film is not giving its viewers enough credit  the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions  why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends  why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine  if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex  why doesnt she have some condoms at her own apartment  these questions are not answered by the screenplay  but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward  a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language  some movies use a lot of swear words  but use them under very justifiable circumstances  as when they are employed consistent with a characters pattern of speech  other films  such as the recent jackie brown  use them in ways that almost parody themselves  booty call just sticks them in to get laughs  and it doesnt work  they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them  half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason  the chinese restaurant  a holdup at a convenience store  and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story  and are in there for filler  this is surprising  considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long  its too bad that the core of the film isnt much better  since it is comprised of sometimes funny  but forgettable dialog  i refer you to the first paragraph of this review  
0	this is one of the worst bigscreen film experiences ive had for a while  with this film  plus showgirls and basic instinct  paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors  his celebrated film total recall was  i admit  successfully scripted  but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws  obviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in a production from someone like verhoeven  the result being that much of the special effects in starship seemed fake  but not everything bad in the film was the directors fault  even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors  it is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards  i expected five for the acting categories   casserole vanity devoid  dense ribald  dingy miasma  and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school  no  they have to pass primary school drama classes first  while total was written well  starship is purely pathetic  all right  it is supposed to be a fastpaced entertainment film  and youre supposed to turn off your intellect  completely  and enjoy the action sequences and special effects  that is  guts and gore   as a matter of fact  i found the activity incredibly boring  a complete waste of more than two hours  half of the film was a bad episode of beverly hills 90210  dina meyer was in  beverly hills    while another quarter was simply nothing  things like presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way on the web   and the rest was a display of humans fighting computergenerated images  the battles were all the same  jumping around  shoot or get stabbed  and on barren planets that only had giant insects  there werent even any stunts  which i consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around  i wonder what the insects eat  if theres nothing but them on the planets  there is so much laughable treatment in this film  and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended  this type of story is obviously aimed at 10yearolds  who cant see it anyway because of the violence and some sexuality  but then  there are always 16yearolds who have that frame of mind  the pointless plot begins when johnnys  vanity devoid  girlfriend carmen  richards  decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth  johnny then signs up as a trooper also  after an overacted argument with his parents  but there is another girl  dizzy  meyer   who likes johnny and then there is another boy who likes carmen  which results in a love quadrangle  which isnt better  because it means augmented worsethanstereotyped soap opera  increased bitchiness  and more bad beverly hills  melrose  and the result of this love quadrangle at the end is also rather stupid  anyway  getting back to the thing you might call plot  johnny is too stupid to be a pilot and has to join the infantry  while his girl and the other dude are in the same league  dizzy comes chasing johnny and joins the infantry also  they then start training  which contains what roger ebert calls ips  idiot plot syndrome  moments when only an idiot would have made such obvious mistakes   then real combat  and guess what  thats about as complex as it gets  oh  and one of their friends  carl  neil patrick harris a  k  a  doogie howser m  d    becomes involved in war intelligence  and his abilities at the end are really corny and make me want to spray insecticide on someone for it  hes my fifth nom for a razzie  the troopers fight  fall in love  die  kill  and try to act  naturally  they win  or sort of halfwin  of course  in between  and at the end  there are soldiers chatting and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs  the bugs also suffer from ips  why would you release hold of your captive before killing it  isnt it also amazing that earthlings havent invented better handheld weapons by then  the only question that remains is why i gave it one star instead of zero  well  maybe aquarter  of a star  for the originality of the cosex shower scene and the  very  brief moments of suspense  another quarter for copying zulu and letting the good guys  the bugs  win  and half a star for the suckingout of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors  but there should have been more  the troopers deserved to die   
0	okay  okay  maybe i wasnt in the mood to watch a mindless action movie  i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii  even while admitting that it wasnt as good as the others  howewer  the latest segal picture didnt look that bad  and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them  i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash  boy  was i wrong  in the first half of the movie  we are already assaulted with segals acting   he is not simply wooden  he is like a wall   gratuitous violence  an incredible plot  sexist and even more gratuitous nudity  and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes  by the end  it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers  not once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided  which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense  of course  in movies like these  there must be a sidekick  and a love interest  in these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model  in the movie   which only functions as a supposed comic relief  by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines   and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie  oh  of course  she appears naked from the waist up  and  of course  segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship  they did not even seem to be interested in each other  i have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie  often  the villain saves the movie  unfortunately  the villains here are cartoonish  stupid and unfunny  unmenacing  how many movies have psycho exspecial forces bad guys  too many  i was able to predict the action all throughout the movie  including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death  the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him  the scene where we are shown the heros superiors are stupid  the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand  etc    simply said  this is moviemaking by the numbers  boring  and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience  my recommendation  if you go see it  bring a watch  youll be looking at it for most of the movie  my  rent die hard  read a book  stare at the sky  do not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid  the real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen  once again  dragged in by my friends  which by the way  liked the movie halfheartedly  they probably like wrestling too     
0	these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes  but  only a few years ago  before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice  sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers  sequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south  the way to regain popularity and prestige  they thought  was the use the same formulas  characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place  one of such celebrity was eddie murphy  black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade  in order to return to the spotlight  he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film  beverly hills cop  1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987  seven years later  for the third instalment  he used the directorial service of john landis  another fading star  with whom he successfully collaborated twice  in trading places and coming to america  this time  however  third time wasnt the charm and beverly hills iii was failure  eddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback  eddie murphy here plays axel foley  fasttalking streetwise detroit policeman  who raids illegal chop shop  the routine police action ends in tragedy  when the criminals kill foleys boss  determined to bring the killers to justice  foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald  timothy carhart   when it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles  foley goes back to los angeles  there  with the help of his old friend  local policeman rosewood  judge rheinhold   foley would clash with money counterfeit ring  ten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different  in this decade  the contrast between blue collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills  which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film  simply doesnt work  screenwriter steven e  de souza provides another conflict  this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and businesslike professionalism of the bad guys  since foley belongs to the former  his character had to watch his language  and the tone of the film in general is more infantile  unfortunately  this film still belongs to action movie genre  and there is too much violence for little children  nice example is the humorous scene in the beginning  which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath  unlike donner with the lethal weapon series  landis simply cant balance the comedy with  regular  action  and the result is a film that fails in both aspects  action scenes are sometimes interesting  but not too spectacular  at the end  scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself   humour  on the other hand  falls flat  to make even worse  some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure  especially art expert turned into arms dealer  played by bronson pinchot   in the end  although the film provided some entertainment  viewers  at least critical ones  would probably be happy to know that there arent any plans for beverly hills iv  
1	jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities  but whom you end up liking anyway  in as good as it gets  the character in question is melvin udall  a successful novelist with obsessivecompulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible  except when he feels like being a royal pain in the youknowwhere  hes mean  i mean really mean  the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium  every day  melvin eats at the same cafe  sits at the same table  and gets served by the same waitress  you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance  when his waitress carol  helen hunt  tells him he can just go sit in another section  and all the other waitresses just cringe  one day  melvin makes a comment that goes to far  and carol  genuinely hurt  comes down on him like a ton of bricks  at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course  but is also the only person who can get to him  too  another person who often crosses melvins sights is simon  greg kinnear   an artist who lives on melvins floor  aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city  simon has the added benefit of being gay  making him a prime target  simons friend frank  cuba gooding  jr    also gay  does not fare much better  when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment  he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital  and frank  who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor  intimidates melvin into watching after simons dog while he convalesces  this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage  an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in  melvin gets to like the dog  and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvins softening up to the world around him  it doesnt happen overnight  but throughout the film  he bites his tongue here  cares a little there  and most miraculously  falls in love  one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others  hes traveling terra incognita here  and it shows  good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film  especially by nicholson and hunt  they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen  greg kinnear  who is becoming known for his supporting film roles  is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon  he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist  and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels  cuba gooding jr  performs with a hypedup level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear  and comes through with a near constant comic performance  the screenplay  by mark andrus and james l  brooks  is clever  touching  and funny  the best part about it  however  is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting  melvin is a man we cant quite figure out  but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention  carol is a working woman living with her mother  trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem  simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers  but who is still not accepted by much of society  combined with the talent of the actors  these characters make the film  the one noticeable area where the film is lacking  however  is the absence of cuba gooding  jr  through the second half  his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary  but the film ends before his return  leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved  i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general  in addition to a part in the films conclusion  theres one actor  who will probably not be recognized by any awards  but who contributes greatly to many of the movies best scenes and who deserves mention  this is that little dog  he plays such a pivotal role to melvins character development  actually serves to forward the plot  and has some absolutely scenestealing moments  that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal  award or no  however  when even the dog puts in a good performance  you know youve got an outstanding movie  
0	the tagline on random hearts reads  in a perfect world  they never would have met   in a perfect world  i never would have seen this movie  the biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film  kay chandler  kristin scott thomas  and dutch van den broeck  harrison ford  are the only two major characters alive  resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious twohoursandthensome production  dutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department  kay is a congresswoman from new hampshire  although they both think they are happily married  their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs  dutch and kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying their partners  they subsequently discover the affair  the rest of the film is the pointless  unrealistic and oftentimes boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to  and getting to know each other in the process  two sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film  dutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer  a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare  all the great stereotypes get pulled  including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter  kays distraction from the films primary focus is her campaign for reelection and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal  these sub plots could have made for semiinteresting points  but the film seems afraid to explore politics or motherdaughter relations in depth  and consequently suffers  random hearts two primary characters seem to live in shells  although both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots  they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other  there is plenty of opportunity  dutch having a partner and kay having close friends and her daughter  but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships  veteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack  and critically acclaimed upandcomer dylan baker both have cameo roles  but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both  other than its weak plot  it is hard to criticize random hearts  however  it is also hard to compliment it  had the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake  rather than the dry one that equates to be

0	the deer hunter  directed by michael cimino  is truly one of the greatest movies ever made  a captivating drama about the lives of a group of friends from a small russianamerican pennsylvania community  the deer hunter promises to be one of those movies that you will never forget  in this academy award winner for best picture of 1978  outstanding performances are turned in by all actors  and ciminos brilliant directing provides the perfect vision into the characters lives  the first act of the film provides us with an inside look into the lives of a group of men from a small community who work and hang out together  michael  portrayed perfectly by robert de niro  is shown early on as the natural leader of the group  after a days work  the men leave their jobs at a factory to head down to the local bar  where john  george dzundza  works  three of the men  michael  steven  john savage   and nick  christopher walken  will be leaving shortly for vietnam  but not before steven gets married  after the marriage  the group  including axel  chuck aspegren   spend one last day on a hunting trip  one of their favorite pasttimes  this sequence of events enables us to view the lifestyle of a normal group of men  who will be suddenly and permanently affected by the ravages and separations of war  the wedding scenes  although criticized by many as being quite long  actually enhance even more the purpose of the first act  the outstanding performances by de niro  walken  streep  savage  and cazale  who died very shortly after the filming of the movie was completed  really begin to shine through and promise not to halt in the near future  the second act of the movie begins with the trio of men on the front lines in vietnam  stationed in a south vietnamese village being attacked by the viet cong  the men are eventually captured and held in a floating prison on a river  this prison  run by the v  c   initiates the horrifying scenes in the movie  where the prisoners are forced to play russian roulette against each other  steven  who is emotionally marred by this turn of events  is secluded in a tiger cage with water up to his face when he refuses to participate  michael shows his leadership again by convincing nick that the only way that steven will survive is if the two friends play against each other  and moreover  they must play with 3 bullets in the gun  personally  i felt that de niros absolutely gripping portrayal really was displayed in a brilliant way in these and the following scenes  the men are eventually able to escape  but are separated  michael is able to get steven  who ends up losing his legs  to medical care  while nick finds his way to saigon and a u  s  army hospital  michael returns home and does not feel at all like a hero  he wants to avoid the celebrations and recognition that his friends would like to bestow upon him  he assumes that nick is still lost in vietnam  the third act concentrates more on walkens character  who eventually stumbles upon a small gambling operation where the game is  again  russian roulette  only in this game  you play for money  michael has learned that nick is possibly still alive and returns to saigon to attempt to find him  the two narrowly find each other at the russian roulette games  but do not link up until michael discovers nick participating in the games and tries to bring him home  a very emotional  and  for many  a very disturbing movie  the deer hunter is a truly magnificent movie that should not be missed  the greatest performances possible are turned in by all actors  and ciminos directing  which is considered to be at his alltime best in this film  is equally dazzling  do not miss this film  it will captivate and astound you  
1	when a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy  he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv and office space  it really is too bad that comedies are so hit andmiss  because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused  it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver  but weep not  dear readers  because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet  austin powers  the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest things ive had the pleasure to see in a long time  a completely looney  delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks  if all comedies  or even half  or   what am i saying   even a fifth of them  could be this consistently hysterical  i would take up residence at my local multiplex  even more to this movies credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleepercult hit austin powers  international man of mystery  the original came out of nowhere  it was a lowbudget  eccentric movie that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody  all of a sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america  ironically  powers  yeeeeah baby  yeah   has almost become an icon of the late 90s  thus another installment was inevitable  but its also undoubtedly welcome  the spy who shagged me is one of the most unrestrained  over thetop comedies i have ever seen in my entire life  it brings back most of the characters from its predecessor  even if only briefly  and adds new ones  austin powers  mike myers   a swinging hipster from the 60s transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his mojo  oh  youll figure it out   which dr  evil  meyers again  has stolen  he enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell  now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed of in a hilarious opening sequence   played without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham and together they go back to the 60s to defeat dr  evil yet again  surprisingly  the real star is dr  evil rather than austin  he gets most of the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie  perhaps this is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately  instead of being the scheming  villainous mad scientist we might expect from a character like this he is a bumbling  often sweet mad scientist wannabe  the spy who shagged me has much of the same stuff we saw in the original  but thats okay by me because the original left us wanting more  by the time that one was over we havent had nearly our share of shag jokes  crude puns and powers antics and this sequel satisfies our appetites  even by its conclusions  im still not sure ive had my fill of bits like  do you smoke after sex     i dont know  baby  i never looked   this may seem awfully immature of me  but understand that the austin powers series  unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us these days  is genuinely funny  i dont know if ive ever laughed harder at any movie than i did during the jerry springer send up or the indubitably hilarious  just the two of us  rendition by dr  evil and his new miniature clone named  minime   i dont have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social satire or anything of the sort  indeed there is little beyond the joy a viewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie did  but as far as im concerned  that is enough    1999 eugene novikov 137  
1	lets say you live at the end of an airport runway  large jetliners continuously pass over your house  rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace  lets say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances  and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home  now lets say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway  and offers you more than its worth  wouldnt you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed  of course you would  but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise  and the house your castle  thats what they are to darryl kerrigan  michael caton   and although hes happy that a multinational corporation would like to buy his home  sorry  its not for sale  unfortunately  the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government  which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice  not about to take this lying down  darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto  tiriel mora  and makes a determined  albeit pathetic  attempt to fight back  the castle  an australian comedy by rob sitch  is perhaps one of the simplest movies ive seen in recent memory  yet also one of the funniest  in fact  it is this films reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful  the good guys and the bad guys are clear  the humor is straightforward  and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets  its the perfect setup for a relaxing  hilarious good time  and as much as i hate to admit it  i liked the fact that i didnt have to think all that much while watching this film  i just sat back and enjoyed myself  the situation is one weve seen before  regular joe fights back against the government  or big business  or whatever  what makes this film different is its characters  darryl thinks hes got the best life in the world  he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind  he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when hes got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal  anne tenny   and he swells with pride when his son dale  stephen curry  digs a hole in the yard  steve kerrigan  anthony simcoe  constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for  investments  like jousting sticks and overhead projectors  while wayne kerrigan is in jail  as a result of dennis denutos incompetent courtroom maneuvers  the great thing about the kerrigans is that they arent so stupid that they get annoying  theyre just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing  we look upon them with a little bit of pity  but a whole lot of affection  screenwriters sitch  santo cilauro  tom gleisner  and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate  further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans  sympathy for their situation  the laughter they bring us  and the familys wonderful characterization  simple as it may be  leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them  i suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans  but trust me  it works  i particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs  dont get me wrong  slapstick  when executed well  can be genius  its just that too often  a film will resort to its use as a shortcut to amusing the audience  not always successfully  instead  the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world  when they are by themselves  the are funny  and when they are with normal people  they are hilarious  one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though  the kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the films running time  luckily  its a funny little detour that  while slightly distracting from the films main drive  is still quite enjoyable  with all the levity abound in the castle  the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept  that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property  an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes  im not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life  but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution  of australia  and certainly sounds impressive at any rate  and  for that matter  its more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this  
0	no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordans harrowing  humorous  horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabes novel about young lad francie bradys  eamonn owens  descent into madness in 1960s ireland  on one hand  it was difficult for me to become invested in francies story because he is such an unsavory character  unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs  nugent  fiona shaw   on another hand  i found it difficult to laugh at some of francies darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick  needy child  having been raised by a drunken father  stephen rea  and a suicidal mother  aisling osullivan   on yet another hand  i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his  for lack of a better word   bad  deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them  however  the butcher boys power is undeniable  and the film as a whole is unforgettableperhaps because it is so disturbing  what makes it so unsettling is the francies overall winkwink yet matteroffact attitude about everything  expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie  rea again   think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs  and youll sort of understand  anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens  love francie or hate him  you cannot take your eyes off of owens  the butcher boy truly is a twisted  unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable  in the lobby after the screening  i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was  i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust   that movie was so unfunny     i didnt know what to expect  its like something you chase for so long  but then you dont know how to react when you get it  i still dont know how to react   michael jordan  on winning his first nba championship in 1991    or  my thoughts after meeting him on november 21  1997 
1	this movie was one of the first american films done by director paul verhoeven  he has done films since then such as basic instict and starship troopers  all of his movies have one main thing in common they dont skimp on the violence  in a verhoeven movie a guy doesnt get shot once in the chest he gets shot many times all over the body  robocop takes place in detroit in the future  things are pretty bleak  the company ocp rules the city with an iron fist and is moving in on running the police force  peter weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his partner  nancy allen  peter weller goes in an empty room alone and gets killed  meanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed209 model robot crime fighter  someone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging from peter weller and make him into the robocop the movie is titled after  the plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace  it drags a bit towards the end with robocop wanting to finish everybody off  but plot twists keep it exciting  the acting is bad from weller when he is human  but very good when he is robocop  nancy allen does a decent job  this movie doesnt leave itself open for a sequel exactly  but they made one anyway  enter    robocop 2 starring  peter weller and nancy allen directed by  irvin kershner detroit is in a more bleak state than it was in the first film  ocp is trying to develop an improved robocop 2 that will be more than a match for criminals  most of the police force is on strike due to ocp taking it over  leaving robocop to be the police force in the city  this film is pretty bizaare  it has a 13 yearold druglord who curses as much as eddie murphy  even more violence than the original  and some more humor  the plot of this movie is pretty large  almost too much so  there are three or four plot lines weaving around that dont really match up  the effects are still decent though  this sequel isnt more of the same really  just a darker version robocop dealing more with drugs than with armed criminals  if you liked the first one  watch this  but be dissapointed  so later comes    robocop 3 starring nancy allen and robert john burke ocp is now owned by a large japanese company  robocop joins a band of rebels to counterattack the evil empire  i mean ocp  the japanese send a cyborgninja to deal with robocop  among other things    this movie is easier to follow than the last one  which means the plot isnt quite as crowded  this movie isnt anything special though  just more of robocop blasting things up in a more kidfriendly way  really not reccomended

0	when star wars came out some twenty years ago  the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image  when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars  we see constellations  meteor showers  and cool spaceships  when han solo goes light speed  the stars change to bright lines  going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point  cool  october sky offers a much simpler imagethat of a single white dot  traveling horizontally across the night sky  was it really only forty years ago  when sputnik was launched  and that before then  no satellites ever existed  have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a thentechnological achievement  even though it was from the russians  it sounds hokey  but when that scene occurs near the beginning of october sky  i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam  played by jake gyllenhaal  determined to make a dent in the space race  he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them  it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket  when lovely teacher miss riley  played by laura dern   suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair  we know exactly who is going to win  but the joy in a film like this is in the little details  for example  homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class  if he has any strengths whatsoever  it is an undeterring vision  and a good organizer  it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school  who knows more about rocket science than he does  it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property  that is  the entire coalmining town   he must walk eight miles one way  just to set up the rockets  which will fail  fail  fail  and fail again  homers dad is played by chris cooper  a favorite actor of mine since lone star  here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in matewan  instead of organizing union rallies  he is the head of the coalminers  who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions  this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year  note how multidimensional his character is  he is his sons last nemesis  as one who most likely interferes with his sons dreams  but he truly loves his son  and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how  through coalmining  because of his character  we can see how far weve come  the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us  we dont understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family  the paradigm was shifting under the fathers feet  and he knew of no other life  so october sky  far from being merely a feelgood inspirational film  offers much food for thought  and this is the best type of inspirational film  the one that you take something with you  btw  the final image of the film is just as simple  is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontalmoving white dot against the nightsky background  another commonplace image  to be sure  but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago

1	synopsis  rumored to be about a true person  the story of mulan has circulated in oral tradition for over a thousand years  and has inspired operas  literature  and even coinage    since 1984  china has been issuing annual gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures  the 1992 set includes mulan   in the ballad of mulan  written in the 5th or 6th century   an imperial edict by the khan  emperor  orders men from each family to be drafted into the army to defend china  a girls parents hear sighing  and think that their daughter mulan  the name means magnolia  is dreaming of boys  but actually shes dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm father if he were to be drafted off to battle  mulan bravely runs away  masquerading as a boy  to serve in the army instead of her father  ten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later  the army finally returns in triumph  the emperor wants to reward mulans valor with a prestigious position in government  but she declines  accepts a horse  and returns home quietly to don her true clothes  mulans old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually a woman  the disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story  only it adds a modern character for comic relief  mushu the dragon  eddie murphy   in disneys mulan  when a fierce army of invading huns threatens to overrun peaceful china the emperor orders one man from each family to be conscripted into the army  old mr  fa  soontek oh  is handicapped and has no son  he has only his spirited young daughter mulan  mingna wen   fearing for her fathers life  the courageous mulan secretly cuts her hair  disguises herself as a man  and sneaks off to serve in the army in her fathers stead  meanwhile mushu  the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the fa family  has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of incense burner    his only duty is to ring a gong   mushu hits upon a plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the disguised mulan to become a macho male warrior hero  with the help of mushu  a horse  and a lucky cricket  can army recruit mulan save china and bring honor to the fa family  opinion  east meets west  i know a chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic  he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down south and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors  from their state of the art animation studio in orlando  disney is hoping to work the same kind of eastwest magic with mulan  i mean  what would you say if i told you that a new movie featured tang dynasty art  with donny osmond singing  mingna wen acting  and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman and the reverend jessie jackson  yet this is the case in the disneys reinterpretation of the familiar chinese classic  the end result is spectacular  mulan is one of disneys best movies ever  personally  im also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weakwilled subservient asian woman take a beating  mulan is portrayed as a normal  if spirited  compassionate gal capable of taking the initiative  mulan is more than just eastern graphics and faces combined with westernized pop and disney  kids of any age will like the family themes  and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing  and adolescent and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor  while the boys admire the battles  and adults can admire those malefemale nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family  honor  and duty with industrial age notions of romantic love  gumption  and questioning  but even the tiniest details reveal quality  the movies art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look  negative spaces  positive detail  period clothing  and graphic designs typical of the time and place  computers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30  000 people  and a special program called attila was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback  and singers osmond and salonga are at the top of their game  balance is crucial  a movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disneys cup of tea  but if you use the character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined and spirited heroine  then  pow  the dream team  by the same token  a tale about a girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself  but toss the dragon in there and youve got enough wahoo individualism for a light hearted disney romp  its rare that a movie can seamlessly combine elements from both east and west  old and young  male and female into a cohesive and entertaining whole  but mulan hits the universal bullseye  its movie for any age  creed  gender  or color

1	seen september 13  1998 at 4 p  m at rotterdam square mall cinema 6  theater 2  with chris wessell for free using my sonyloews critics pass  theater rating    12  good seats  average sound  picture unstable   rounders  is exactly the kind of movie parents dont want their kids to see  its not that its a drunken orgy of sex and violence  but because its a film that flatout says you can make a career out of gambling  and to take make things  worse  it proves this through its original  fascinating story  there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the  noir  mood  that is  the dark  shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life  this film starts off in the tradiational noir style  introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing  matt damon stars as mike mcdermott  a 20something law student in presentday new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played  damon narrates throughout the film  but the entire opening scene is voicedover so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting  mikes about to go up against teddy kgb  malkovich   a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer  but then again  he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense  the look in his eyes  his slow movements  his intricate mannerisms  all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld  literally   damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectlygroomed features  but his narration is what brings it all together  he never sounds like hes reading from a script  nor that hes trying to embellish anything  it just comes natural to him  the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood  from the smell of the air  to the logic involved in reading the other guys faces and cards  and all without sounding remotely trite  immediately we get the sense that poker isnt for gamblers  but for near geniuses with nerves of steel  the game is a quiet war  with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers  the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car  but when it comes to the game of poker  all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man  the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act  it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit  we learn only a little about mike  both past and present  presently we know he has a girlfriend named jo  gretchen mol  who he constantly argues with over his gambling  they go through a few breakupmakeup cycles until mikes childhood pal and fellow rounder  worm   norton  is released from prison  its not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob  but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does  technically  the plot isnt unlike many childrens sitcoms in which the  good  kids  bad  friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid  what this film does is use a different medium to tell that story  mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives  but both share a passion for outthinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them  where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating  hence his jail time   mike always takes the cards hes dealt and works with them  sometimes they pay off  i  e  his ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money   but other times they dont  i  e  the fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping 30  000 on a single hand   once things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood  mike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places  from socialites mansions  to taking the tourists at atlantic city  to outwitting the gangsters that control it all  everything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everythings a battle against the cards destiny deals  one scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge  martin landou  in a perfectly cast and performed role  that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time  matts good at gambling but hes also got potential to be a great lawyer  he could go professional as either  but with one he could lose everything or win big  but with the other theres stability but not much risk involved  can someone whos gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave  if the film had been just a subtle lesson in pokerplaying  then the ending is our test  everything is told from mikes perspective  but were finally able to recognize some things on our own  this makes the final  againstall odds showdown seem like just that  it works just like the game it revolves around  showing us some of the cards  but still evokes the element of the unknown  and the consequences thereof  what separates  rounders  from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end  
0	on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements  in case you missed it  warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail  he says to a black congregation     if you cant cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife  youre never gonna get rid of me    well  there is such a plot  and it works very well in this comedy  beatty plays jay billington bulworth  a longtime democratic senator from california  the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworths latest commercials condemning affirmative action  the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy  when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv  having gone without food or sleep for days  his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care  first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe  a 10 million life insurance policy in his daughters name  then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination  his assistant murphy  oliver platt  is oblivious to bulworths suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements  bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an africanamerican church  then takes questions from the audience  he is hit hard with questions about his voting record  he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots  and it hasnt shown up  since hes a dead man anyway  he figures hell answer truthfully  he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l  a  for the photo opportunity  they made some promises that improved their public image for a while  and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made  the shock and outrage from the congregation grows  the questions keep coming  and he keeps shooting back honest  if ugly  answers    before i go further  id like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make  and that is that characterizing africanamericans as maltliquor drinking o  j  fans is not part of bulworths  truth   that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie  when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics  this line is not what theyre talking about   the experience is liberating  with nothing left to lose  bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth  he can say whatever he wants because hes going to be dead anyway  why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician  that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists  and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism  bulworths candor wins him three volunteers from the church  one of whom  nikki  halle barry   he gets a crush on  he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something  chicken wings  appropriately enough  bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives  when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings  bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment  with so much money and so many talented people working so hard  he wonders  why cant hollywood make a quality product    you go  warren   when they become indignant and ask why hes talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product  he callously admits that its because they are rich jews  that night he drops the three africanamerican volunteers at their nightclub  and he decides to go in with them  he stays up all night drinking  smoking pot  dancing  falling in love with nikki  and learning to scratch turntables and rap  the next day  he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suitandtie fundraisers  from then on  at all of his political appearances  he raps his political truth  his rap is not bad for a middleaged white guy  hes not very good  but it is his first try and at least hes not embarrassingly bad  his lobbyists are not amused  but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth  eventually  the movies plot  remember he hired a hit man   overtakes the politics  which is too bad  screen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him  there are even a few gratuitous chase scenes  bulworth fleeing his killer  these scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along  but it distracted and detracted from bulworths political ranting  which was much more interesting than the everpresent  obviouslooking assassin  still  most of the movie is original and very enjoyable  and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen  as the story and screen writer  he came up first with a good structure  then with good dialogue to back it up  jeremy pikser cowrote the screenplay   as an actor  he was able to convincingly portray bulworths depression  then liberation and rebirth  as a producer  there were four others  he was able to keep the movie free from hollywoods indulgent formulas  except for those inexcusable chase scenes   someone else probably could have directed  but since he was there anyway  what the heck  its too bad that there arent more movies like this around  movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics  after all  much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news  just a little perception and

1	my filmcritic  com colleague norm schrager nailed session 9  brad andersons throwback to spooky horror films from the 70s  it worked as an eerie homage without being selfreferential or smugly postmodern  genre aficionados will acknowledge the similarities in tone to stanley kubricks the shining and george romeros dawn of the dead without being taken out of the engrossing narrative  i  e   a psychologically addled waste management team clears out an abandoned lunatic asylum  unspeakable dread ensues   in a doublewhammy for 2001  anderson shoots and  mostly  scores again with his eclectic riff on timetravel episodes from the twilight zone  appropriately titled happy accidents  much like session 9  the cards are played very close to the vest here  is boyish  eccentric  sam deed from dubuque  iowa  a futuristic voyager from the year 2470 or just your runofthemill psychologically disturbed nutcase let loose on the presentday streets of nyc  as played by wonderful character actor vincent donofrio  full metal jacket   its up in the air whether or not we should accept his detailed monologues about life after the polar ice caps have melted  the question proves to be moot  at least for a time  even if the whole thing proves to be a creative delusion  one agrees with the character judgment passed down on him by his new girlfriend  ruby  marisa tomei    hes a freak  but he sure tells a good story   neurotic ruby thinks she may have found true love after a series of nightmarish dating disasters  the junkie  the fetishist  the artist  the frenchman  etc    but isnt quite sure how to handle  sam deed  when he starts explaining the barcode on his arm  his elaborately constructed fake identity  his pathological fear of dogs  his ability to speak five different languages  and his mission to change a crucial moment in time that may have ramifications on times alternate realities    dont ask   its all a bit much to take in  rubys close friend gretchen  cuz ya cant have a love story without the token friend  though nadia dajani invests the thankless role with warmth  chalks it up as a sexy roleplaying game  but her cautious therapist  holland taylor  warns her that codependency is rearing its ugly head again and shes in over her head with yet another doomed relationship  who ya gonna believe  despite her winning an academy award  marisa tomei has always struck me as an annoying and unwelcome screen presence  one that undermines the pleasure of watching happy accidents  her brassy new yawk attitude never really meshes with her desperate desire to appear  cute  to her adoring fans  being loud and flashing a  disingenuous  smile does not necessarily equal  substantial and sexy   it takes more than a crack team of hair and wardrobe people to imbue her with personality  then theres that damned voice  which strains to be ohsoadorable  look  this stuff is purely subjective  some people feel this way about richard gere  others cannot bear to watch robin williams hyperactive schtick  for my money  its m  tomei with a bullet  happy accidents is a romantic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys  or  more appropriately  chris markers la jetee  especially with those still framed  memory  photographs anderson employs as a stylistic device throughout   modern manhattan is filmed with an otherworldly  vaguely alien eye with a color scheme oddly reminiscent of logans run  as the stranger in a strange land  donofrio walks slightly outofstep  wonderfully affable but often inscrutable with his wayward expressions and bemused detachment  this is science fiction told mainly via the power of suggestion  though it often falls into the scifi trap of having entirely too much forced exposition  we want deeds  not words   at least twenty minutes too long  happy accidents eventually gets around to a raceagainsttime scenario that puts  sam deed  to the ultimate test  no movie can live in ambiguity forever  but anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well structured recent narratives    lets pretend the loathsome and predictable next stop wonderland never happened  shall we   there are also some slow  repetitive stretches as ruby and sam go over the same arguments again and again over whether or not hes crazy  the premise is strong enough to sustain interest  but its enough to throw a nod in the general direction of rod serling for wrapping up his ideas in halfhour time slots  commercials included  
0	after a rather disappointing  mary railly   stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise  this is one of the best surprises of this season  a sweet  small budget comedy with a big heart  in fact its not even a comedy  its a drama or even more precise  a clever satire on human relationships and needs  based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby  high fidelity is a wry and likable story about a mans quest for fulfillment and happiness  rob gordon was a dj  it seems that he could make everything spin  except his own life  now he owns championship vinyl  a little musical store  somewhere in new york  when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend  a gorgeous blond attorney  life suddenly looses every purpose  decimated  humiliated and on the verge of a mental  and emotional  breakdown  he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been  about whats right and whats important  he starts  categorizing  life  dividing it into  top 5 lists   and the most important is the  top 5 list  over the most painful breakups of his life  starting with 5th grade  when he found his young girlfriend with another boy  though you might think that people change  grow more mature with age  it just doesnt seem that way and all robs relationships were different versions of that first  where did he go wrong  was it he that screwed up  or maybe life just stinks  while he is lost in his own selfpity  he must think of the  top 5 list  over his needs for the future  find the right elements and mix his life together  with clever parallels to the cult of celebrity  music and with incredibly direct narration  it addresses the average audience member  in other words  people like you and me  although a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter  and frears  the director  the acting is equally important as the written word  and here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned  he is simply superb  it is as much his movie as it is frears  the film would not be the same without him  cusack  whose character is sadder  wiser and 35  brings intelligence and warmth to post mod irony  most of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera  not an easy task  but cusack pulls it off  his interpretation feels so emotionally right  so incredibly realistic and precise that frears message simply cant be ignored or overseen  the other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job  both  and jack black are fabulous  even catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts  not just looks beautiful  however  the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as robs coworker and friend dick  this is such an impressive achievement that its almost worth a oscarnomination  he is simply a joy to behold  otherwise  everyone are in their place  and at the right time  all part of frears colorful blend  pretty much like edward nortons  keeping the faith   this film doesnt follow any formula or belong to any genre  its dramatic  tragic  sarcastic  comic and even cynical  but never bitter or angry  its a little bit of everything  pretty much like life itself  nothing seems unreal or staged  it reflects reality as a mirror  as you watch it  you go through the same emotional problems as the main character  you feel and think and reflect  this effect has become a rarity nowadays  although its primarily about the perils of love  high fidelity is secondarily about pop music  rob owns championship vinyl and his employees  timid dick  todd louiso  and overbearing barry  jack black   are fellow music snobs  music is the language in their lives  the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives  and so does the movie  it is as much a musical film as anything else  as robs journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments  in the end  you have gained something while watching it  its not the film of the century or even of the year  its not an special effects extravaganza  it doesnt require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed  its a small movie about the big things  and even though it does not contain heavy philosophy  you feel as if you have experienced something of significance  and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time  
1	when robert forster found himself famous again after appearing in  jackie brown   he immediately signed up for a little film called  american perfekt   this was almost two years ago  i waited patiently for the film to be released  but it never was  finally  i forgot about it  the other day  though  while i was perusing the selection of the local video store  i stumbled upon  you guessed it   american perfekt   i immediately rented it and with a certain amount of glee  rushed home to view it  having now seen the film  i understand why it never saw theatrical release    american perfekt  is a jumbled mess  the storyline is nonexistent  it took me half the movie just to figure out what was going on  and at that point  the only thing i really knew for sure was that the movie was  never  going to introduce a plot of some sort  it wants to get by on quirkyness and socalled charm alone  and it just doesnt work  robert forster plays a psychiatrist who picks up amanda plummer  and they head off on the road together  along the way to no discernable destination  they run into all sorts of kooky and wacky characters  i suppose this freewheeling  no plot style is supposed to give the film an element of danger and excitment  but all it did was make me sleepy  im all for trying new things within the realm of film  but not at the expense of coherence  nothing in this movie makes sense  the actions of the characters go unexplained  even when theyre truly bizarre  ill give you an example  without giving too much away  david thewlis has a part as a drifting conman  at one point  midway through the movie  he runs forster and plummer off the road with his car  as he passes them  we see that his face is covered in blood  do you think we would get an explanation as to what happened to him  you would think so  wouldnt you    american perfekt  is a waste of time  nothing is gained from watching this movie  except maybe a migraine  and if you do rent it  dont bother trying to figure out whats going on in the hopes that everything will be resolved by the end  this doesnt happen  and no explanation is given for the misspelling of  perfect   either  
1	deep rising is one of  those  movies  the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us  it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god    screw that  it says boldly  lets see some computer generated monsters rip into  decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors  heh  them wacky monsters  gotta love em  of course  since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story  hollywood must give that little extra  oumph  to get people in theaters  that is where deep rising fails  which is a good thing  confused  let me explain  despite all them flashy effects and big explosions  deep rising is still  at heart  a good ol b movie  luckily  its a very good b movie  the worst cliches in movie history are a b movies bread and butter  therefore  things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre  of course we know theres a big slimy creature behind that door  that one person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always know which persons or person will make it out alive  we just dont know when or how horrible it will be  i went to see deep rising with my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high  imagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually  well  pretty darn funny at times  a funny b movie  well  thats new  these flicks are not supposed to make us laugh    except for a few unintended laughs once a while   and before you know it  treat williams  wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen  hey  i know them guys  and gal  from a couple of other movies  cool  familiar faces  so far so good  our man treat is the hero  hell live  wes is a staple of b movies  he is the token victim  we know hell buy the farm but he will take a few creeps with him on the way out  famke is the babe  nuff said  there is also a guy with glasses  the guy with glasses always dies  a black person  b movie buffs know that the black guy always dies  never fails  and a very funny  nerdy guy    ah  comic relief  how can we possibly explain having to kill him    let him live   after the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home  i know who to root for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew    please kill me   suffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my seat a few times  went  ewwww  about a dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing  im a man  we nottice these things  all in all  id recommend deep rising if you are looking for a good time and care to leave your brain at the door    but bring your sense of humor and excitement in with you  the acting is decent  the effects top rate  how to best describe it  put together the jet ski scene from hard rain  the bug attacks from starship troopers  a couple of james bond like stunts and all those scenes from friday the thirteenth and freddy where you keep screaming  dont go there  hes behind you  and you end up with deep rising  for creepy crawly goodness  tight tshirts  major firepower and the need to go to the bathroom every fifteen minutes from seing all that water  
0	traffic violation dr  daniels review of uturn dr  ds rating  critical condition  okay  heres the deal  ill be the first one to grant that everybody needs a day off now and then  ill even go so far as to say that a vacation is a necessary part of doing any job well  i mean  hey  ive been known to stretch a weekend into a threeday outing  if friday looks to be a slow day  and if monday aint looking like a pickmeup  well  ive been known to give martha nell a call and say   do me a favor  sweetheart  bump old man fergusons boil lancing to tuesday morning  and tell miss audrey that ill swing by her house monday evening and see if we cant get her trick knee back in line   a simple sentence like that  and ive got a nice fourday fishing trip with the boys  or more often than not  a trip up to cherokee  n  c   for jackpot bingo and assorted other mountain funnery  but the point is  if you take a day off  do something different  if youve worked yourself silly for months  relax a bit  sleep in  eat pancakes at noon  microwave an egg in its shell  watch pro wrestling with the sound off  listen to some barry white records at high speed  whatever  but do not  under any circumstances  spend your vacation doing the same thing you do for a living  and  if you do  dont make the final product look ten times worse than it would any other time  because i do not want to hear your sob stories  oliver stone  you apparently thought you needed a break from making  important films   cool  so you found this hinky little book and decided to make it a movie  thats cool  too  but  ollie  old sage  do not take a good story and a hot cast and make one of the most pointless and worthless films of the decade  im just eager to meet you one day  so i can buy you a stoli  look you in the eye and say   what in the wide world of sports were you thinking with uturn   and ill stand there staring til i get a straight answer  sean penn stars uturn  as bobby  a drifter whos had some troubles a while back  hes heading cross the desert minus two fingers when his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose  stranding him in superior  arizona  held there by an  ignorant  inbred  turtleneck hick  of a mechanic named darrell  while darrell puts a new hose on the ride  bobby walks into town to see whats cooking  is it needless of me to say that superior  arizona  is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely  probably not  bobby meets up with grace  jennifer lopez   who invites him back to her place  for drapehanging and other domestic issues  just as those issues are starting up  graces husband  jake  storms in  looking like checkout day of the elks lodge convention  just beats bobby silly  bobby takes to the road  only to meet up with jake again  and jake asks bobby to kill grace  a little while later  grace asks bobby to kill jake  them murderous arizonians  gotta love em  if any of this sounds familiar  congratulations  you win a kewpie doll  the story is a straight shoplift of red rock west  a cult favorite a few years back from john dahl  maker of the phenomenal the last seduction  but the contest doesnt end there  guys and gals  we get steals from russ meyer movies  where everybody in town is horny and sweaty  we get the town from bad day at black rock  minus the train  plus busty women who can speak  look at any schwarzenegger film  and youll see our hero  bobby  as bobby has a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times  has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times  gets bit by a tarantula  gets shot at  and ends up with vultures circling overhead  all the while getting up like he just got a shaving nick  bobby as terminator  stretch it a bit  and we have a fivefinger discount from doc hollywood  where the whole story occurs because of car trouble  forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic  okay  hes working from a book  so maybe ollies not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas  i just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative  i just wish he hadnt brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toestub  sean penn gives a great performance  and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be  playing overthetop caricatures of stereotype characters  the best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blanketyblank is going on  too bad its not fun to watch when its happening to us    while we sit through this mess of a film  uturn is not a bad film if youre a fan of technique  its the oliver stone youve always known  robert richardson is his usual cinematographer  and rob and ollie know how to shoot a flick  great camera angles  shifting viewpoints  wicked colors  nice looking pictures  but pictures of what  i think id rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tiltowhirl point of this loser film  plot twists are one thing  repetition is almost unforgivable  and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie ive seen in the past five years  oliver  i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at  youve been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie  and films like platoon  jfk  wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on  your scripts are certainly respectable  your budgets are up there on the screen  and your actors dont dog it  and i know that  maybe  with uturn  you were just kicking back  just having fun  thats fine  but dont do that with a movie with the potential of this one  do some police academy sequel  imagine that   do a big comedy  like a remake of its a mad  mad  mad  mad world  but do not drop a limp uturn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as  an oliver stone movie   and not question why it stinks like weekold snook  theres a right way to have fun  and a wrong way to have fun  this was as wrong as you can get without going to jail  
0	according to popular film opinion  a films greatness is determined by time  take for example  casablanca   great film  even today  its still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic  another example would be  star wars   which had a very  very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before  but as i rewatched  independence day  when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996  i kinda felt like it wasnt as cool as when i had first seen it  i had liked it when i saw it the first time     was my original view  and basically saw it as a good  escape film   but when i rewatched it  i felt cheated  thus  the curse of the  event film     independence day  is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once  except for a couple kids  the critics  in this situation   but after a while  this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one  well  this kid is the  event film  in my little analogy  and when i rewatched  independence day   not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen  but i felt insulted the whole time  there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just arent sure if its comedy or hokey drama  one scene  youll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch  the next youll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around  saying corny lines  the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of  glen or glenda   now this annoying kids problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once  he shows he has no balls  and  independence day  has no balls  it plays it safe everywhere  it throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films  the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of  star wars   i mean  isnt that devils den  and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moores breasts in  striptease   theyre these octopus men  boring freaking octopus men  i mean  come on  the aliens in  2001  were more interesting and you didnt even see them  basically the plot is straight from a bmovie from the 50s  aliens come to earth and we wonder if theyre hostile or peaceful  okay  its an interesting topic  but its not handled greatly  now they arent and somehow a computer geek  jeff goldblum  figure out theyre using our satellites as a countdown to destruction  yep  these aliens are not only heavily armed  theyre stupid too  they also use the same kind of computer as we do  but that comes about later  the president  bill pullman   whos under attack for being a wimp  decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent  and he decides hell stay in the white house which the aliens have covered  i dont care if its bob freaking dole in the white house  get him out of there  i dont care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol  just get him out of there  later on  hes stupid and wants to fly in the attack on a big alien ship  i think its time for impeachment for this guy  hes more senile than reagan on pot  then theres a cocky pilot  will smith  who is the only person to survive the counterattack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51  the films only sign of being brave   his girlfriends a stripper sharing a subplot with  striptease  in that she has to do it for her son  come on  she has a fighter pilot boyfriendsoontobe fiance  i think she can quit that job and get a more respectable job at long john silvers  shes also the few  the proud  the lucky to survive the igniting of l  a   as well as her dog  who narrowly survives   there are some bright spots  they tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing  the best one is when jeff goldblum  nicely named david  turns on his computer and a picture of hal comes up and says   good morning  dave   and they even played r  e  m  s   its the end of the world as we know it  and i feel fine  at the beginning  and judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great  hes a stereotype  but i just loved the man anyway   but there are no real subtle comic moments  will gets way too many oneliners and he has no one to play off of  execept jeff towards the end  and the two do great   as i said  this film has no balls  it is just aiming for a crowd pleaser and thats what it is  but after a couple months  we all move on to the next  event  film while intaking little films and a couple indy ones for good measure  but at least the indy ones last for a lifetime  this ones short on batteries  
0	    be warned    the following review contains some harsh language    the blair witch project  quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time  if you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace  because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy  my colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more  then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more  and this worked for him  well  im sorry  but nothing    is nothing      nothing is not more  its nothiiiiiinggggggggggg        i do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing    nothing  is free  available all around the world at a location near you  i am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary  i could just discount them and say   well  i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow   but i have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesnt hold water  there must be some other reason    then again  maybe my first thought is correct  i think ill try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction   when i hear people praising this film  i never hear them talking about what makes up about 97 of this movie  three kids bickering with each other about being lost  they only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time  this being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout  josh    over and over  this film should not be called the blair witch project  it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost    and argue with each other  oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting  josh     and if you thought that was scary  wait till you see a pile of rocks  and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs  oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear  oh yeah  and some goo on one of their backpacks  youve never seen terror like this folks  and you dont want to  the chevy chasegoldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film    for current films  i highly recommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience   this film is an example of marketing with no substance  the marketing was brilliant  and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film  they want this film to be good  and i think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they dont have anything else to praise  that wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along  but this is not it  this film could have been so much better  just think  if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost  and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff  i saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it  she was sold on this film  and then  at one point during it  she turned to me and asked     are we supposed to be scared by this    ive heard one opinion that you  have to use your imagination  to create the fear in this movie  well  i thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do  use their imagination and create a good movie  i mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay 5 bucks for it  but even if you like this idea  then what are you imagining  an entity called the blair witch  some rednecks fucking with these kids  are either of these things really scary when you think about it    ive heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something  well sure thats scary in real life  but there are a lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary in a movie nor even interesting  you could sit in your house and see a snake or a spider and it could be scary  but in a film it wouldnt be  and no  a movie does not need a big budget or cgi special effects to be scary or creepy  actually the less the better  see the equally awful remake of the haunting   but you have to do something  you cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary  if it were real  and by the way  about the shakycam filming in blair witch  arent these supposed to be  filmmakers  who should know how to point a camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly  im not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified  thats justified  im talking about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they cant seem to shoot anything smoothly at all  minor quibble there  there is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers  that the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank  and i think there is a good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves  what was i thinking     but  if they dont  then thats fine  if it works for them then thats okay i guess  i just lament that by making this movie a hit  we are going to be subjected to more of the  nothing is more  approach  pretty soon were going to get some movies like this  just a still shot of a prison jail cell  for 90 minutes  and well have to use our

0	in   the muse  albert brooks plays steven phillips  a hollywood screenwriter who after winning a humanitarian award for his work is dumped by his studio  they claim that hes lost his edge and his agent is quick to agree with them  he knows that he needs to write something fresh and original and quick or else his career will be over  so he turns to his  best  friend  jack  jeff bridges  another screenwriter whos enjoyed success after success  on the way over to jacks house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman  sharon stone  into a cab and begins to think  is he having an affair  when confronted  jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is  in fact  a muse  a mythological figure who is believed to have inspired all creativity  and has helped him garner his success    she doesnt do any actual writing   he is told   but inspires you   steven is excited by what hes hearing and asks jack to call her up to see if shell take steven on as a new client  jack arranges a meeting between the two and suggests that steven bring her a present  preferably something from tiffanys  after the meeting the muse  sarah decides to take on steven  but at a price  she wants a suite at the four seasons and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her  like bringing her salads in the middle of the night   stevens wife  andy macdowell  sees him at a food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon  steven confesses everything and  although at first suspicious  she later allows sarah to move into their guest room and eventually into their life  the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble hes going through for her  and thats a question only time will tell    the muse  is albert brooks sixth film as writerdirectoractor  he cowrote with monica johnson  and although its a good movie its not up to the level of his best works   defending your life  and  mother    the problem lies in the script  and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor  there arent nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good oneliners  it has a great premise but doesnt deliver up to its full potential  but  i like albert brooks in this film and i think that we can all identify with steven phillips a little bit  he may whine and complain  but he just wants to support his family and be happy  and i like sharon stone in this movie too  its a nice change of pace for her  and i also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes of rob reiner  james cameron and martin scorsese  and although  the muse  doesnt have as much to say about hollywood as robert altmans  the player  i still left the theater feeling good  and thats something i wish i got out of more movies  
0	for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking  or whats left of it in mainstream hollywood  movie which are star vehicles are terrible things  as a rule  the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor  an actor might be chosen on the upandup  to give him exposure  or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck  generally  though  the actor doesnt matter  and soldier  the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers  exemplifies this  the picture lacks pizazz  the star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell  otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less  russell plays todd  a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought  the movie lets us see this degenerate process  but by the time the real plot starts  were into todds later years  hes about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers  ones who  instead of being trained  from  birth  are genetically selected  before  birth  the pride of this class  caine 607  jason scott lee   will be our villain  and you know hes the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movies start  between the two leads  less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken  and its possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction  director paul anderson  who helmed last years icy thriller  event horizon  doesnt show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam  todd  upon being replaced  is left to die on a garbage planet  but in order to stretch the running time out  the villains return to the garbage planet on a  routine patrol  and set the stage for the final firefight  events are predictable from the time that the setups are made  and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here  the most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be  todd fails to show physical superiority against caine  in fact  not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie  but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry  its not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story  and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it  the best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit  and treat it as a parody of typical action fare  like universal soldier  a strict interpretation  however  reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style  class  or substance  and by next year  a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television  
1	the characters in  palmetto  collectively sweat enough to fill lake erie  and its just the right way to capture the films ripe atmosphere of sensuality  tension and even farce  this humid floridaset thriller nurtures a modestly absurd edginess that often winks at itself  which is very much a good thing since the actors and director are in on the joke  as far as setup is concerned  the movie is nothing we havent seen before  but be patient   palmetto  spins some pretty wicked story twists that we really dont see coming  its not a classic by any means  but it sure is quite an engaging surprise  harry barber  woody harrelson  is fresh out of prison  where hes served a couple of years for a crime he didnt commit  even though he harbors animosity towards the obtuse local officials  harrys first order of business is to return to his home town of palmetto to be with his sculptor girlfriend nina  gina gershon   while searching for work  he catches the eye of rhea malroux  elisabeth shue   the mysterious sexbomb wife of a palmetto millionaire  rhea proposes a scheme thatll get harry 50  000 easy  to play a small part in the staged kidnaping of her jailbait stepdaughter odette  chloe sevigny     you do like risks  dont you  mr  barber   rhea alluringly coos  boys  form a line behind me  part of  palmetto  s success can be attributed to the performance of elisabeth shue  who demonstrates here that her oscarnominated turn in  leaving las vegas  might merely be foreshadowing great things to come  shues a seductive  campy delight  and pulls off a barbara stanwyckgloria swanson combo with admirable relish  the other actors form a solid ensemble around her  including sevigny   kids    tantalizingly slutty as a teen tease  as well as the everlikeable gershon  cast a far cry from her extreme roles in  bound  and  showgirls   harrelson is still doing fine followup work to  the people vs  larry flynt     palmetto  does have its share of grievances  harrelsons narration is needless  i suppose  and gershons nina cries to be meatier than she ultimately is  one of the plots unexpected angles  that harry is asked by the police to become the press liaison for the very crime in which hes involved  could have been played a little better  there are moments when you question the tone  but its never so unstable that it deserves the reproach its been receiving from most other critics  if  palmetto  didnt want to be laughed at  would it really have tacked on a climax that plays like a liveaction  who framed roger rabbit   although a few elements can be questioned  the movie works well on its own terms  thanks to a juicy cast  especially shue  and the nifty material approach from director volker schlondorff  you remember him from last summers suddenly repopular  the tin drum   right    everything runs smoothly  and for fans of revelationheavy endings  this films got a few shocks in store that i wont even dream of revealing    palmetto  is a generous amount of fun to watch  and thats all you need to know  
0	about an hour or so into  the jackal   a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence  and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out  i hope she gets killed now   at that point it hit me  i didnt care for any of the characters being played by actors i didnt really like  when the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because hes being played by sidney poitier  you know somethings rotten in the state of denmark  every year  a couple films like this are released  you know  the cheap  action packed international espionnage film  featuring a semipromising premise  some bigname actors  usually bruce willis   and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago  this was the third one of 97  following the very lackluster  the saint   which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe  and the surprisingly fun  the peacemaker   featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain    the jackal  tries to mix both elements  and you thought  the saint  was bad    the jackal  is loosely  very loosely  i hope  based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that ive yet to see   the day of the jackal   which featured  apparently  a suave hitman called the jackal  played by edward fox  trying to assasinate charles degaule  well  welcome to the 90s  where a sorta suave hitman  also called the jackal  bruce willis   trying to kill the head of the fbi    or is he  after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother  killed in the opening scenes   the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere  from helsinki to virginia  setting up an elaborate scheme wherein hell be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion  and like the saint  the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people  the agent working on the case  cater preston  sidney poitier  yes  that sidney poitier   working with a russian agent  valentina koslova  diane venora  lady capulet from  romeo  juliet    gives up early on and meets with an exira man  declan mulqueen  richard gere  putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of 97  whos in a massachusetts jail  but who has apparently seen the jackal  who has been eluding the law forever  soon  hes out working with the two untrusting agents  and trying to help them catch him  there are numerous problems with the film  and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on  the film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller  but save a couple moments  the film never achieves suspense  or even a sense of intrigue  sure  the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense  but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register  the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience  or even an entertaining one  it doesnt help that the plot is designed to be complex  but falls into so many problems  like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances  the script of  the jackal  is a complete mess  mostly because it cant decide what it wants to focus on  is this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer  is it a film about a nasty  amoral hitman whos in everything for the money  or is it a combination of both    the jackal  aims for the latter  but never focuses in on either character  the connection between the two feels completely edited  so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan  you wonder how he recognized him so fast  the worst part is the little past they try to give declan  most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend  isabella  mathilda may   given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then  the supporting characters are worse  sidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role  that of a man who is just stern sometimes  and other times more giving and likable  what is poitier doing here  hes one of the best living actors  does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this  diane venoras russian character is almost as bad  with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth  and a plastered on expressionless facade  its not that anyones bad here  its that they have nothing to do  the plot is a joke  feeling like it was pasted together by someone in postproduction who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time  the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain  there are several times where hes in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself  the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill  take a scene where hes being followed by some agents into a parking garage  he quickly sprays his car another color  and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it  doesnt killing someone attract more attention than it does distract  and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place  geez  is there anything good here  well    a couple things  i did like williss icy expressions  he may not have been real suave or anything  but some of his looks are worth a chuckle  richard gere has a couple of good moments  making his character as likable as he possibly could have  and a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous  completely inane but fun kinda way  most notably  a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder  jack black   and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man  which has its share of a couple good jokes  most particular a kiss by willis  but none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go  theyre just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is  the jackal   director michael catonjones  who directed the far superior  rob roy   has made a film that is made very couple months  one that is unentertaining  unintriguing  and pretty much cold  but will nevertheless make money because  hey  the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retroclancy kinda way  every now and then  the filmmakers get it right   clear and present danger   which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way   but  the jackal  is an example of when they go completely wrong  
0	there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom  surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strongworded attack on a group of stoic doctors  when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way  i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture  you see  patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries  i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it  and i actively hate it now  days later  with the simpering  superficial  nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories  i hate every element of the film  beginning with tom shadyacs shameless direction  and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey  the badness of patch adams is stupefying  its confounding  i cant believe a film can be this bad  and yet  its based on a real man who probably has a good point to make  in the film  patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams  in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human  in the beginning of the film  patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesnt want to kill himself  while there  he notices that the doctors dont care about the patients  and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings  so  patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients  he goes to medical school  where he meets truman  daniel london  and convinces him that its good to help people  he also meets carin fischer  monica potters   the antimale med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor  naturally  the dean of the medical school  bob gunton  hates patch  and wants to thwart his plans  even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams  so patch decides that hes going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have  and that  my friends  is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998  on a superficial level  the film is not particularly bad  i wouldnt say the cinematography bothered me  and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for  i actually liked potters performance  even if she is wasted   but the film fails fundamentally in execution  every scene swells with grand   emotional  music  played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard  take  for instance  the first scene  which shows patch sitting on a bus  we dont know patch yet  but theres sad music  and its supposed to make us really sad that hes sad  later on  patch makes a lot of progress  he helps a dying patient  peter coyote  to enjoy the last days of his life  and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively  and when that patient finally dies  spoiler alert    the music is very very sad  but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions  real drama is characterbased  you grow to like someone  and then something bad happens  and you feel it  we dont ever grow to know the dying patient  hes simply a vehicle for patchs greatness  real drama doesnt seem forced  or present just to make the audience cry  thats why patch adams is not real drama  it goes for every cheap tear imaginable  wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene  even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaimans sickening musical score  sentimentality like this is indeed bad  but its not as bad as halfbaked  simplistic themes  you see  patch is a really great student  he aces his tests without studying  and does it so effectively that people think hes cheating  but patch doesnt think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor    why dont we see patients until the third year   he bursts out every three seconds  well  patch  that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients  not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort  most of us have to study  and a doctor who really wants to help  but doesnt know a toe from a finger  probably wont be too successful in preventing death  oh wait  i almost forgot  the point of doctors is not just to  prevent death   but to  improve the quality of life   yes  that is true  and you can not do that without studying  you can not do that without going to medical school  what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe  just maybe  it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later  follow the rules  bah  who needs the rules  only uptight doctors follow the rules  the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants  and then theres the free clinic issue  which i find shockingly  frighteningly idealistic  a free clinic  in the middle of the forest  where patients can be taken to be helped  for free  how will patients be transported to the free clinic  will it have an emergency room  or is it just for mental patients  and who  may i ask  will pay for it  the film does give some token attempts to question patchs motives  i think another character asks him how hes going to pay for it  in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance   but they certainly dont explore or challenge patchs ideas to any meaningful extent  reader  please understand this  i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams  i know nothing about him  if his beliefs mirror those of this film character  then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them  but regardless of what the real patch adams believes  the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony  and in the last scene  the big  obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus  patch does a lot of shouting  actually  robin williams does a lot of shouting  he shouts a lot about helping people  and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words  i wont tell you that you cant be moved by his words  because i  too  was moved by his words  i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be  patch adams is the cheapest of them all  
1	from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker  the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong  at reagan high  four girls are sitting on top of the world  courtney shane  played by rose mcgowan  holds the title of meanest  most disrespectful soul in the school  everyone hates her  but everyone envies her due to her popularity  courtney is the  leader  of her clique  which also includes julie  played by rebecca gayheart  liz purr  played by charlotte roldan  and marcie  played by julie benz are the other three in the group  it is lizs seventeenth birthday  and julie  courtney  and marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent prank on her  but the prank results in the death of liz  just like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one  the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like a murder committed by someone else  and also just like in other teen directed movies  one of the four dont agree with hiding it  this time that character being julie  and finally  just like in other teen movies  there is a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth  this time that character being fern mayo  judy greer   who is subject to many cracks from courtneys group  as well as the entire school  from here  jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge  bad morals  and at least trying to do the right thing  not only is the script weak  on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large amount of the main cast  judy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional  annoying character  as she overacts every line she has  also on the bad side of acting is julie benz  almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers  on the positive side of acting  rose mcgowan performs well here  but doesnt match her wickedly clever performance as  tatum   in 1996s scream  mcgowans role is annoying  but this only adds to the film  she is wickedly mean  and even though she a wellwritten character  you downright hate her  faring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart  who is always exceptionally believable as her roles  when the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character  she turns it into three  always putting strong emotion and power into her roles  gayheart isnt given as much to do here as she was in 1998s urban legend  but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker  jawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout  hardly throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in  we get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident  and get into things that dont have anything to do with the actual film  the beginning and ending are strong  its just the middle that needs a lot of help  during the body of the movie  it is undeniably repetitive  never progressing towards a conclusion  nothing to grab the viewers interest is around  and the same  extremely annoying song plays over and over again  jawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless  but falls flat  the few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off with a bang  all in all  a horrible disappointment  the bottom line  the tagline reads   even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside   yes  that is too true  no matter how good this film may have looked  it fails to deliver  
0	ladies and gentlemen  1997s independence day is here  its title  starship troopers  and surprisingly  it is more entertaining than id4  i realize that i gave last years scifi hit a 4 star rating  but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour  after subsequent viewings  i feel that independence day really wasnt as great as it seemedthough i still give it a positive review  starship troopers  on the other hand  has a mocking sense of humor  knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem  as a result  starship troopers is a more exciting  energetic  and lively science fiction film  in fact  i probably could never get tired of watching this film  starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars  another kickass space opera which reinvented the scifi drama altogether  while starship troopers is no star wars  it comes quite close  and the easiest assessment would be to call this film   the star wars of the 90s   am i being to generous to this film  perhaps  but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance  effectively  into the warring races  in essence  this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction  the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films  and i may have to  starship troopers is not quite an original film persay  but director paul verhoeven gives the film a  kickthealiensasses  style  id4 had this same style  except it was forced  most likely the cause of will smith having a major role  this new  star wars  has a very simple  basic plot  mankind vs  an alien species  the alien species in question here is the bugs  a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnidtype insects  however  the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy  sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes  but during quiet moments  we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization  more than likely  these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends  and they should be  i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thoughtprovoking film  this is an  event  film  but surprisingly above average  it is extremely refreshing to watch a scifi war film  and actually root for the human side  something independence day never achieved   starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange  join the army  ads  mixing a webbased interface  these summations of events are refreshingly original  stating   would you like to know more    these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor  and we know we should not take it seriously  however  we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle  in a gory  yet funny  way  after witnessing the slaughter  the film jumps back one year  to setup what we just saw  we are introduced to johnny rico  casper van dien  and carmen ibanez  denise richards   rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms  however  carmen isnt as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot  however  another classmate  dizzy flores  dina meyer   has her eye on rico  unfortunately  rico isnt interested in dizzy  this setup is rather cliched  as is the result of the setup  but it still is fun to watch  carmen signs up to become a starship trooper  and as a result  rico signs up  and as a result  dizzy signs up  everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy  carmen gets the pilot position she wanted  carl jenkins  neil patrick harris   a psychic  gets a position in the training program  and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers  the mobile infantry  the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships  in reality  i found myself watching a space version of  melrose place   but with better special effects  an hour into the film  the war begins  a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with  the first hour may have been a funny  sometimes unintentionally  setup  but we grew to care for the flat characters  because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters  their gorgeous looks won me over  call me superficial  if you must   following the training sessions  which had many dramas in themselves  too many to mention here   the troopers are sent to war  the bugs live on the planet klendathu  a planet which consists of dirt and rock  and pretty much nothing else  many dramas occur during the war  until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs attacks  a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense  the troopers are ordered to locate the  brain  and capture it  i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible  because starship troopers is not about plot  its about special effects and gory violence  director verhoeven  most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct  returns to his scifi days  which gave us good films like total recall  verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa  but despite all the violence  the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood  starship troopers is extremely violent  with more gore than this years event horizon  the r rating is well deserved  and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it  my guess is that verhoevens target audience is the 18 to 25 male group  the film has a testosterone level off the charts  with chiseled men and beautiful women  despite these superficial elements  starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful  while watching the film  we never second guess the characters decisions because they seem perfectly clear  thankfully  no hero is punching aliens in the face  which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with  the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with  but they soon grow on you  casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon  to most guys  he will come across as artificial  fortunately  van dien is the worst of the cast  despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character  dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character  her dizzy is extremely likeable  denise richards also does a good job  and her scenes are very well done  jake busey  gary buseys son  gives a wonderfully funny performance  and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film  neil patrick harris  remember  he was doogie howser  is a little wooden  and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast  however  he does give a good performance  michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm  his performance rises above the rest  perhaps it is because his character is the most developed  but i think it is just ironsides presence on screen  unfortunately  no particular cast member gives a starmaking performance  which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars  director verhoeven is the main star of the film  his direction is fast and unrelentless  he never slows down his pace  which makes for a wild ride  writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein  the writing is usually very funny  and sometimes very corny  the dialogue is smart but not too smart  we arent required to know everything  but some plot holes are left unanswered  thankfully we are not intended to notice  and we really dont  except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while   amazingly  with all the wars and romance going on  the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues  in fact  these governmental changes seem fairly plausible  and this adds another layer to the story  the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre  but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage  i havent laughed this loud  even in some comedies  oh  and the special effects are first rate  starship troopers is rated r for graphic scifi violence and gore  and for some language and nudity  believe me when i say this  dont take young kids to see this film  it is extremely violent  in fact  it is probably the most violent film out this year  however  if you are old enough  over 17  to see it  starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain  its been a long time since i have cheered for the heros  while also cheering for the bad guys  and still  it is my dream to see a scifi film in which the alien race destroys mankind  and take over the world  now that would be entertaining  
0	this christmas  little ralphie parker  peter billingsley  wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree  although cautioned by many that he will  shoot his eye out  ralphie remains optimistic  conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers  it could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun  and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one  a christmas story is a favorite among many during the holiday season  and boy  it is certainly easy to see why  ralphies endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood  when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable  evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things a christmas story does so well  here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody during the holiday season  1  period detail  this film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard  who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940s with loving detail  shepard narrates from a first person pointofview  divulging his various adventures one snowy december  in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head  shepards firsthand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious  but also witty and warm  with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing  on top of that  young billingsleys stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration  director bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality  i can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like  2  mom and dad  both melinda dillon  as mom  and darren mcgavin  as  the old man  are perfect in their roles  its hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one  with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured  for instance  he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound  and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues  in portraying the writer as a persistent but mildmannered young lad  peter billingsley has struck quite the chord  his performance is richly textured  making all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor and enjoyment  which brings us to     3  the comic situations  there are plenty of memorable moments in a christmas story  moments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each new viewing  with so much more to explore and to cherish  i am particularly partial of the  fword scene  in which ralphie blurts out the shocking fourletter obscenity while helping the old man in the yard  again  shepards method of handling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry  the numerous sequences that stick in ones mind include  of course  the famous department store santa scene  in which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree  i could go on  but ill finish on this note  a christmas story is a standout among holiday movies  because it captures so much in a meager 90 minutes  not only is it funny  its often genuinely hilarious     not to mention warm  fluffy and touching in all the appropriate places  i plan on making a christmas story a christmas tradition  why dont you  
1	ive never been a member of the robin williams fan club  a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way  and i sometimes feel as though im watching a 40yearold class clown  in his films  williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchyfeely emotion  leading to wildly uneven performances  mrs  doubtfire seemed readymade for the same problems  but instead it proves to be williams best comic screen project yet  while it still contains some characteristic selfindulgence  mrs  doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging bellylaugh comedy served up with high energy  williams stars as daniel hillard  a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior  one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda  sally field   and she files for a divorce  unemployed  living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children  daniel decides to respond to mirandas ad for an afternoon housekeeper  he turns to his brother frank  harvey fierstein   a theatrical makeup artist  and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire  a matronly 65yearold englishwoman  daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on mirandas flirtation with a wealthy client  pierce brosnan   to spend time with the children  and to learn something about responsible parenting  all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best  mrs  doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work  and basically it does so  the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel  and thanks to the fantastic special makeup thats instantly believable  it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film  making dustin hoffmans dorothy michaels look like milton berle  more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell  its a bit hard to swallow that she doesnt recognize any of the voices as her husbands  perhaps the biggest contrivance were asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs  doubtfire in a few minutes  theres more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask  fortunately  these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll  during the film  i was generally too busy laughing  after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams riffing  mrs  doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place  daniels frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful  as is the climactic restaurant sequence  even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away  clearly  most of the credit for doubtfires success goes to robin williams  it took putting him in drag  but for once he plays a comic character that isnt just robin williams with a different name  he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire  and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foulmouthed  wisely  he never aims for saintly  his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty  but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity  its one of mrs  doubtfires charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect  just people trying to be better  as miranda  sally field is solid in a background role  and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu  the children are also good  although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest  the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing  its easy to see mrs  doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over  and its true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common  but mrs  doubtfire manages to carve out its own space  particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judges decision and the ultimate status of daniel and mirandas relationship  theres nothing dazzlingly new in mrs  doubtfire  but there are plenty of laughs  and good comedies are always in short supply  and its nice to see robin williams just act for a change  
1	disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life  richard  leonardo dicaprio  sets off for thailand  there he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy  robert carlyle  who gives him a map to a beach  a secret utopia  then commits suicide  richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel   tienne  guillaume canet  and fran  oise  virginie ledoyen   once they get there the three discover a secret society existing on this beach  there richard falls for fran  oise  this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element  which is solely a creation of hollywood  seems to hold to the original novel  the cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking  i dont think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning  but that is were many things go wrong  darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography  though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking  the plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts  this is where the movie has some great potential  then the three travelers get the island and there is a turn for the better  yes folks i said better  now up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good  nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise  this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost unwatchable  there is even a video game style sequence that borders on the disgusting  it doesnt make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion  and i am hoping many other peoples   i am hoping that in my little rant ive made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing  so if you go see it and you dont like it because of this dont blame me  the character development was not up to par either  i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child  although there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard  leos character  comes off as a wannabe philosopher  the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason  granted some people are like this  myself included  but i nor anyone i know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does  the next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough  richard is obviously obsessed by fran  oise at the early stages of the story  yet there is actually very little development along this story line  this i am sure contributes to the movies lack of core plot and being unfocused  now  i shall move onto something a little better about the movie  for all you cynics out there the movie did have a few good things about it   the cast and acting was passable at the very least  and i think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard  mind you i think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better  which begs the question why is leonardo paid so much    i think this is a topic all on its own so i wont get into it   but i like the fact that there was an international cast used  had only and american cast been used i can see this movie being horrible  the international flavor added a more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable  not to mention the movie is set in thailand and a global cast makes more sense  when all is said and done i liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable  i would not recommend this movie to anyone  the fact that i liked it has a lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story  as it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt  if you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings  
1	ok  i admit iti find camp amusement with the spice girls  yes  the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual  identities   they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of  girl power   but not even their guilty pleasure appeal isnt enough to carry their big screen debut  a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world  the film begins amusingly enough  with a cheeky 007esque title sequence in which the british quintet  scary   melanie brown    baby   emma bunton    sporty   melanie chisolm    ginger   geri halliwell   and  posh   victoria adams  are introduced one by one  to  much to my surprise  excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience  as they croon the silky ballad  too much   a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film   a few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film   1  the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at londons royal albert hall   2  a film producer  george wendt  and a screenwriter  mark mckinney  pitch various film ideas to the girls manager  clifford  richard e  grant    3  a documentary film crew follows the girls   4  a pregnant  mate   naoki mori  of the group rapidly approaches her due date  and  5  a tabloid publisher  barry humphries  attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug  richard obrien   capped off by a live rendition of the girls bouncy hit  say youll be there   a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow  right  wrong  its all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches  i must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves  but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them  much less a organized framework for all the  wacky  goingson  spice world jumps from vignette to vignette  subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense  at one minute having the girls meet with aliens  no joke  and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride  while a decent joke slips through the cracks here and thereduring a  dance bootcamp  scene  the girls sing the lyric  we know how we got this farstrength and courage and a wonderbra  much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level  some gags are just plain pointless  such as roger moores recurring role as the mysterious chief  who dispenses cryptic  metaphorheavy advice to clifford  the only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond  ha ha  as weak as the script is  i think theres one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie  and that is the girls themselves  the point is not that they cant act  and  for the record  they really cant  but that their individual personas  which works as a gimmick over the span of a fourminute music video  are too thin to survive outside of the truncated  video bite mtv world  posh  who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions  comes off best by default because her persona  rich bitch  most easily translates into character in a film  babys persona  young innocent   to a lesser extent  also works  but the remaining girls identities are a little harder to flesh out  there really isnt much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often  which is exactly what fuller and spiers do   and  after all  what exactly entails being  ginger  or  scary   apparently  just their wardrobes  spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices signature hit   wannabe   the song is as grating as ever  but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a muchneeded shot in the arm  setting the stage for a wave of selfreferential humor stemmed from the screenwriters film ideas  the film almost mirrors robert altmans the player in the way the film snails into itself   this section of the film  involving all manner of derringdo involving a speeding bus  is perhaps its most effective  but it also points up how all the other storylines  the publisher  the documentary crew  lack a satisfactory payoff  spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family  and it will please the spice faithful  but this sloppy enterprise surely wont win them any new fans  which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states  once the hype disappears  spice world will likely serve as the the spices final hurrah in america  
0	the premise of the new teentargeted horror film final destination causes a recollection of a memorable simpsons halloween episode  after attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster  lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable timemachine  after a trek into the cretaceous period  homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world  again and again  homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it  the characters of final destination have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence  their design  someone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake  that someone is death  you see  alex browning  devon sawa  and six others have cheated the grim reaper     but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve  for a high school excursion  alexs french class is traveling to paris by airline transport  alex  tense and neurotic  has a shocking premonition after boarding  he sees the plane  and every passenger on it  spontaneously explode in midair  in a panic of sheer lunacy  alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft  after a handful of others  including one teacher  follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane  the unwitting  survivors watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky  the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize  but death wont be cheated so easily  and one by one  the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances  the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi  before i delve into the meat of the review  id just like to confer     is that one helluva premise  or what  final destination  creepy beyond rational comprehension  probably reads more like an unsettling xfiles episode than the simpsons  therefore  the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong  on familiar turf  the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong  and the opening 20 minutes of final destination reflects that  unlike most thrillers  the setup is crisp and cool  you just deeply  sincerely hope that the momentum wont unspool  leaving us with a secondstring effort with nothing but cheap  derivative shocks  young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration  what with i know what you did last summer and sequel  idle hands and  a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil  urban legend  after the setup  when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair  i started to really have fun with final destination  low and behold  a teen thriller that is actually unsettling  actually suspenseful and  yes  actually intelligent  some splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside  this film is among the most refreshing and allout enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cuttingedge scream in 1996  final destination stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the bloodspattered slasher crap weve endured throughout the past few years  not that the characters are that good  sawa is game as alex  a connectthedots personality that we never fully comprehend  in addition  the survivors are endearing geek tod  chad e  donella   jocky controlfreak carter  kerr smith of dawsons creek   carters ditzy girlfriend terry  amanda detmer   the nonetoosubtly named billy hitchcock  seann william scott  supplier of lukewarm comic relief  and a lone teacher  the emotionally delicate ms  lewton  kristin cloke   aside from alex  the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter  varsity blues   playing an abstract character named clear rivers  what were her parents thinking      the personality of clear is written with such a vague  nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flashcard saying hello  i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main characters plight   toss a few stereotypical fbi agents  daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith  and a     ummm    spiritual mortician  former candyman tony todd  into the mix  and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing  dicing and assorted disembowelments  not so  final destination has no slicing and dicing  or at least none dealt by a human killer  and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening  the extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying  murdererontheloose concept  with assistance from a shrewd  intelligently paced screenplay by morgan  wong and jeffrey reddick  the plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity  listen up  reindeer games   but i suppose the most satisfying aspect of final destination is the murder scenes  creative  resourceful and breathlessly inventive  the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to a characters demise  what will trigger the accident  will it be the john denver record  just put on to play rocky mountain high    yeah  sick humor   will it be the leaking toilet  the falling fishing reel in the corner  the murders are startling and largely unforeseen  including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward  a sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach  it gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes  but who cares  its fun  in that simple regard  final destination is my cup of tea  this stylishly executed thriller  although tagged with laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue  is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side  after the show  it will also have an frightening impact on you  when will your  design expire  is death waiting around the corner  the final effect

0	when i first heard that kevin costner was making a movie called  the postman   i thought   an american version of il postino   starring costner  god help us   when i found out that it was not a remake of  postino  but an postapocalyptic epic  i thought   landworld   please  god  make him stop   as it turns out   the postman  is a much better film than i had expected  despite being set in 2013  the movie is  at heart  a western  a band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers  a wandering hero opposes the bandits and inspires others to fight back  the setting  however  allows that familiar plot to take on greater significance  american society has collapsed due to plagues and wars  and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages  the struggle of a dead society to be reborn has a grand quality and deserves the epic scale costner grants it  costners nameless character  a wandering actor  rides in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem  will patton   a former copymachine salesman turned bandit king  our hero escapes and discovers the body of a dead postman  taking the uniform and bag of mail  he passes himself off as a representative of  the restored united states   he is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets  one young disciple  ford lincoln mercury  larenz tate   organizes a fullscale postal service  ford spreads the postmans message of hope until bethlehem finds that the oncemeek villagers are beginning to resist his rule  as war breaks out between bethlehems army and the postal workers  costners character steps into the legend he created and goes from selfcentered loner to leader of the revolution  his lie of the restored united states becomes a selffulfilling prophecy    postman  is an odd blend of a bleak setting and a message of wideeyed optimism  sort of  sergio leone meets frank capra    but its treatment of hope and renewal is compelling  what could have been another knockoff of  the road warrior   like  waterworld  was  surprises the viewer with a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble  tate is the standout in the movies large cast  ford lincoln mercury  selfnamed  is the polar opposite of odog  tates character in his debut film   menace ii society   1993   and tate makes fords innocent belief in hope as convincing as odogs cynicism and brutality  his performance sells the movie  interestingly  as tate moves from his usual streetsmart roles to youthful optimism  the softeyed patton  who usually plays nice guys  proves a disarming villain  olivia williams makes her film debut as the postmans love interest  abby  when they first meet  abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile  predictably  the husband is soon eliminated by the bandits  and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero  however  their relationship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored  she  torn by grief  guilt  and anger  he  resisting his destiny     the postman  is costners best work thus far  perhaps that alone gives us hope for the future      
1	whats to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornographyie  the garbage known as  snuff  films  nothing  right  whats to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography  well    nothing  so  why make it  hollywood  theres no reason why the average  sane moviegoer will be interested in such a topic  no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this  the lack of quality filmmaking in  8mm   from technical to acting  stands out even more when you consider the star  writer  and supporting castall reputable  but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again  like paul schrader  schumacher has his moments  but theyre few and far  far   between  basically  this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it  why not walk out  well  this wouldnt be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie  heres why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of  8mm     first thingif you dont heed my advice  then understand what youre about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud  its not easy to watch  i didnt know the details of the story beforehand  but at least my ignorance can help others now  the  ha   plot revolves around tom welles  nicolas cage  as a surveillance expert and private investigator  a rich old woman discovers a  snuff  film in her late husbands safe  she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl  it had to be a young girl  didnt it  schumacher   who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead  shes horrified that her husband would have owned such a film  in 8mm  of course  and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find  familyman welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque  murder   let me backtrack for a moment  see   snuff  films are pornos with a violent twistpeople are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead  however  the deaths are often staged and  in those cases  special effects and  good  acting make all the difference  very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hardtofind movies  the thought of this  industry  makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review  but ill swallow my bile and move on  welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry  youd think hes sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him  he comes across smut clerk max  joaquin phoenix  who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze  after a lot of digging and bribing  welles finds the men who are responsible for making this  and other   snuff  films  skip ahead  skip ahead  skip ahead    led by dino velvet  peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance  and startorturer  machine   christopher bauer   they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue  the movie doesnt end there  unfortunately  because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films dobecome a vigilante  this film doesnt draw you in  it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close  it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour  ie    se7en    but it takes a large measure of restraint  schumacher has none  and a larger amount of talent  schumacher has little   by those jabs  im not only referring to his stylish destruction of the  batman  franchise  but  a time to kill  was an immensely overrated disappointment  for a guy who gets so much studio money  his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled  a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter  writer andrew kevin walker didnt recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for 95s twisted thriller   se7en   director schumacher doesnt have that innate ability to make you watch things you dont really want to see like better directors are capable of doing  he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we dont see is more frightening than what we do  especially when its a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered   however  gratuitous is joels middle name  he must think that not flaunting a hardcore act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint  no  he doesnt go that far  but we see enough unpleasantness  he doesnt leave much to the imagination  its manipulating to hurt  or kill  young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante  the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters  yet schumacher has no subtlety in his  ha ha   craft  case in point  a shot of a christian fellowship bus  good  right   drives away to reveal one of the villains  bad  right    see    no subtlety  does joel think were stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery  who do we root for in this mess  is there anybody out there  its not all the directors fault  though  why did the actors sign up for this  nicolas cage is an oscarwinner  for cryin out loud  if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money  what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda  what is cage supposed to be in this moviea whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears  villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy  and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash  he was so solid as a concerned father in  a civil action   i guess ol nic  pete  and jim were promised a mountain of money    or theyre suckers  or they just dont care  there are moments  albeit brief ones  where this rises above the wasteland  catherine keener is good  although too quick to threaten divorce  as mrs  wells  baby cindy is obviously cute and wells devout love of his daughter is sweet  the mother  amy norton  of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter  this film has an appropriate bluetoned  washedout look like  payback   which was a much better movie   the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue  but at other times its rough  during some conversations  closeups and wide shots are not cut very well  making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts arent good and whose timing was a halfsecond off  such a technical error indeed stands out  speaking of standing out  dont believe the misleading trailers  theres not much action here  occasionally  yes  but not as often as your tv will have you believe  after seeing  8mm   i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again  is that a positive  well  if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive  theyve done a swell job here  itll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chanceunless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved  but today im not depraved  so i ask  why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it  im sure that somewhere right now theres some pretty sick crap going on  but that doesnt mean i need to know about it  yes  mr  walker  your script tells us that there are some screwedup folks out there  yes  mr  walker  the proverbial monster doesnt look like we expect him to  you said all that in 1995  move on  this film serves no purpose  it doesnt entertain  it doesnt teach us anything  it doesnt make a statement beyond the obvious  this stuff is bad  approach  only if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile  thats not likely to happen  though  so  8mm  is indeed a scummy waste of money  orson welles said years ago in a tribute to film   to movies    to good movies   if only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole  like  snuff  films   8mm  should never have been made  now  excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it  useless triviajoel schumacher loves the vigilante theme  he used it in  batman forever   in  batman  robin   in  a time to kill   in  falling down   and its rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow    
0	its tough to really say something nice about a type of person whos so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone  but by god   american history x  does it  and for that  i commend it  it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neonazi skinhead  a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone whos not what they are  and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off  the subject of this film is one of them  but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack  hes the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage  and then in another brilliant stroke  justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks  hes so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process  his name is derek vinyard  and hes played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks hes almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as  say  malcom x  when we first see him  hes clean shaven  with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast  a devlish goatee  and hes attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets  at least when he doesnt need them  he so believes in his convictions that hes willing to put his beliefs to the test  even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison  if only for a couple years    american history x  is about derek  how he became a neonazi skinhead  how he rose to power  how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself  and how he tried to save others  namely his younger brother  from making the same mistake  we see him at all of these stages  as a smart teenager  a vicious hate monger  a man having an epiphany  and the man who tries to correct what hes done before  and in all of these  we get a portrait of a man from all sides  or at least  thats the intention  the films framing device is his brother  danny  edward furlong  perpetually looking about 13   also now a skinhead  and how his principal  bob sweeney  avery brooks  who i just found out was or is the captain on star treks deep space 9   is trying to  correct  him  when the film opens  danny has just written a book report on  mein kampf   landing him in trouble with sweeney  which causes him to make him write a paper on dereks life and how it has gotten him nowhere  coincidentally  this day is the day derek is released from prison  and when we see him  hes cleanedup  not as buff  and has a full head of hair  hes just as intelligent  but still very rough along the edges  but hes wisened up  hes no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews  and tries to persuade danny  whos becoming what derek was before  to give up his lifestyle  but danny wont  he goes to a large skinhead beer bash  meets with the skinhead leader  stacy keach   and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neonazidom as he was for it a couple of years ago  the film circles around this  then spins off into nonlinear flashbacks  all done in black and white  we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead  living in venice beach  organizing vicious and quasisadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white  middleclass teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work  and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on  to them  the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop  and he not only speaks elloquently  forcefully  and intelligently  but he backs everything up with political reasons  justifying their rage at least to them  and frighteningly enough  much of what he says sounds true    american history x  is a collection of really great scenes and moments  rather than a cohesive  great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next  in it  there are some of the best scenes ive seen all year  one scene features a dinner between dereks family  and his mothers newest boyfriend  played with reserve by eliott gould   a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with dereks rightist views  launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience  goulds reaction to dereks final summation is unnerrving   another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black coworker  guy torry  while folding laundry in prison  and another soontobeclassic is actually divided in two  the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail  which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year  theres much more to appreciate  like the acting  which is uniformly good  with standouts coming from avery brooks  beverly dangelo  as the longsuffering mother   and gould  who has one horrible line  but other than that  comes off with the best performance hes given in what seems like a really long time   norton walks off with the film  though  coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble  in only the fifth movie of his career  norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation  and maybe the best  theres nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie  spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience  coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando  that he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing  sadly enough  this isnt going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be  its too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece  the ending  especially  is pencilled in from other movies  tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon  some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches  kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the  fat skinhead   whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more   and even the dramatic arc isnt as well travelled  furlongs danny never seems to really be learning a lesson  since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view  and when he decides to make a change by the end  which was inevitable   it doesnt seem like it has actually arrived there  even dereks descent into skinheaddom doesnt seem justified  though his fireman father  william russ  the dad from  boy meets world   and dont ask me how i know that  is killed by a black junkie  and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently  there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs  as such  one can see why the director  tony kaye  wanted to have his name removed  sorta    american history x  is a very good movie  and i was very moved by it  but it could be a lot better  and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential  somewhere  he claims  there lies a tony kaye cut  and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton  who then ordered another cut  and that is thus  although he aimed for the directing credit to go to  alan smithee   the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director  it wasnt allowed to him  under the grounds that once you disown a film  you can not badmouth it  but really  thats the macguffin  no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval   kayes right in that its not up to par  even if hes not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par  this will not be a  do the right thing  for the late 90s  yet it still gets its point across intelligently  and backs it up with its story  its message  that one cannot be so enwrapped in ones own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur  is literally said over the narration  unfortunately   and even if it isnt perfect  at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison  and asks him if anything hes done has made his life any better  it realy hits a nerve  not only in derek  but also in the audience  
1	some movies have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled  making you think carefully and recollect on what you have just seen  i finished mike figgis  leaving las vegas  hours ago  and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on the vcr  alot of people refer to this film as  that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude     leaving las vegas  is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other for what they are  a drunk and a whore  ben  nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years  is the drunk  his family and friends have long since abandon him  and all he has left is his liquor  in a scene early in the film  we see ben staggering into a resteraunt  looking for a  friend  of his to mooch some money off of  he finds the guy  richard lewis  having dinner with a buddy and two chicks  trying to crack witty jokes that just come out stupid  when ben approaches the table  you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable  after lewis gives ben the money  he coldly says  i think it would be best if you didnt contact me again   now even though through the course of the film  some much more depressing things happen  this is when i felt the most for ben  there was such a look of sorrow and dispare on his face   not to sound hokey or anything  it almost brought a tear to my eye  it turns out that ben was once a semisuccessful hollywood player  and apparently a pretty popular guy  now he spends his time getting robbed by hookers and trying desperatly to pick up women  not so much for the sex  but for the company  for someone to talk to or spend time with  once he is fired from his job  ben decides to burn all his belongings  collect all his cash and relocate to las vegas to slowly drink himself to death  one night he runs into a prostitute  a brilliant performance by elizabeth shue  how far she has come since  adventures in babysitting   named sera  she is involved in an abusive relationship with her pimp  a scumbag who getsoff by cutting her  they are both very lonely  selfdestructive people  they immediatly hit it off  both of them realizing that they need one another  and it isnt even a sexual relationship  they dont even have sex until  like  the last ten minutes of the film    leaving las vegas  is not a film about plot  with the exception of what i have already revealed  which all happens in the first thirty minutes or so  by the way   there isnt too much of a story to it  it is more a film about people and how they react to one another  from what i can see  this is basically a perfect film  the direction is great  with mike figgis doing a brilliant mix between the glamor of las vegas and the moody  smokey atmosphere of a film noir  and it contains two of the best performances to come out of the 90s  or any other decade for that matter  but dont go rushing out to see this movie without knowing what youre getting yourself into  first off  if you are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge  stay away from  leaving las vegas   it is filled with lengthy discussions of orgasms  rape and various forms of perverted activities involving burbon  thats right   secondly  if you are not in the mood to see a very depressing film  dont see it  however  if you are cool with those two things  you are in for one of the most memorable experiences you will ever have

basquiat  angel heart  and grant morrison  dave mckeans graphic novel  arkham asylum   the cavemans valentine is a feverish tale of a homeless madmancumdetective who  on the morning of february 14th  discovers a  valentine  just outside his new york cave  one of ella fitzgeralds strange fruit  stuck in the crotch of a treea young male model murdered and frozen to a branch  believing at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant  shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building  is responsible for the murder  romulus  samuel l  jackson  is put on the trail of an avantgarde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould  david leppenraub  colm feore   his minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation  romulus was a brilliant julliardtrained pianist prior to his psychosis   romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his policewoman daughter  aunjanue ellis  that even though hes a nut  that doesnt mean that he cant solve a highprofile society murder  every moment an exhausting workshop of ideas  and every character the same  the cavemans valentine is a concept so  high concept  that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment  with romuluss  caveman  a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlanes urban noir hero  spawn  with a longvanished wife  tamara tunie  acting as a spiritual guide  the occasional social caste commentary  the secret base in a cave  a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters  and a wickedly colourful archenemy  the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars werent inscribed with  gotham pd   that being said  the cavemans valentine can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy  a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart  the difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when  in fact  the cavemans valentine is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless  again like mcfarlanes spawn  while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts  it is no small detail that our hero  romulus  is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life  in legend  without knowledge of his royal birth  but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park  in the romulus mythology  signs of romulus royal blood is brought by twelve vultures  while in the film  the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds  but of the carrion itself  whether or not romulus of the cavemans valentine will found a nation  or  in the case of novelist george dawes green  upon whose novel his own screenplay is based  a franchise  the fact remains that the cavemans valentine is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far  it  along with m  night shyamalans unbreakable  is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has  since millers seminal  the dark knight returns   redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics  readers of sam keiths brilliant  the maxx  comic series  or of mtvs shortlived animated adaptation of the same  are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne  the failure of both  the maxx  tv show and of the cavemans valentine  not forgetting the initial backlash against unbreakable  suggests that the public may not be ready for americas surprising contributions to dark fantasy  luxuriantly lit  brashly saturated  and comicpanel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent  death in venice  ca   while inhabiting robin standefers  practical magic  mesmerizing sets  the cavemans valentine is an unremittingly gorgeous film  kasi lemmons  following up her brilliant 1997 debut  eves bayou  which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism  fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys  artists and suffering  the cavemans valentine is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape  clearly not for every taste  when approached with the correct paradigm  it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year  a redefinition of the hero archetype for a postmodern audience with urinestained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes  the cavemans valentine is a fine and a courageous film  crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliots rats alley wasteland  
0	for his directoral debut  gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent  alcoholic husband and father  and the various lives he affects  but while the characters  places and events may have special meaning to the writerdirector  the audience is left in the dark  the center of this tale is the abusive raymond  ray winstone   and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him  he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars  then  he returns home to his pregnant wife  valerie  kathy burke  and their fiveyearold daughter  raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies  and his paranoid delusions  early on when he accuses valeries brother  billy  charlie creedmiles   of stealing  raymond then proceed to beat  and bite  him to a bloody wreck  but these are the least of billys problems  billy is a heroin addict on the downturn  and it doesnt seem that hell last much longer  billy and valeries mother  janet  laila morse   is raymonds nemesis  she disapproves of him  and he of her   but is powerless to do anything about it  she merely struggles on  hoping her children will survive their respective torments  if this description seems bleak  i havent told the half of it  this is not a cheery movie  and most of the time its downright depressing  while at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick  and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him  in the end  its not quite worth it  there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose  take for example the extended sequence where one of billys scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy  the film is filled with these  character moments  that never really achieve anything  granted  there are a few genuinely powerful  and sickening  moments in the film  but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us  the actors do a fine job  particularly in the central roles  the good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes  and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into  the bad thing about an actor turned director is that theres no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices  a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience  oldman got it about half right  
0	the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do  lives are often at stake  and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable  prone to turn on the negotiator at a moments notice  the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor  psychologist  and sham artist  in addition to being a police officer  he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence  or failing that  must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower  most of all  the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible  and quickly gain control of the situation  dominate the conversation  and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants  it takes a pretty smart person to do that  but what if the hostageholding criminal is just as smart  what if hes also able to think on his feet  in fact  what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor  it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f  gary grays the negotiator  in this film  police negotiator danny roman  samuel l  jackson  is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force  when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in romans home  roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder  faced with the scorn of most of the police department  and under close scrutiny by the media  roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captains office  i dont quite remember if the captain actually said   i hate to do this  but      although it wouldnt surprise me if he did  luckily  the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above  after being offered a takeitorleaveit deal by the district attorney  roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum  j  t  walsh   taking him and others hostage  and proclaiming he has been framed  although romans actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational buildup  gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian  kevin spacey  which soon ensue  jackson  while a superb actor  is miscast in the role of roman  the actor has become so popular  and so often identified as a protagonist  notable exceptions can be found  such as in jackie brown   that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats  the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence  how can we believe hes going to shoot a hostage  no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier  unfortunately  this preconception saps the film of some of its wouldbe suspenseful moments  and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jacksons acting ability  almost every time hes in a scene  jackson steals it without looking back  when spacey appears  the film has already run about a third of its course  his is an interesting character  made out to be some kind of negotiating superman  our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation    i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower  but i cant talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone   he says  when he gets the call to action  however  he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be  soon  his character has to negotiate not only with roman  but also with the swat commander  david morse  who is itching to send in a team to take roman out  all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation  should negotiations fail  this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor  as the second protagonist  spacey measures up nicely  gray really lucked out with this cast  david morse as commander beck  ron rifkin as commander frost  and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent  and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey  the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices  morse played a similar role in the rock  rifkin played the d  a  in l  a  confidential  and spencer played a police detective in cop land  with the level of acting  however  this can be forgiven  also in the supporting cast  paul giamatti as rudy  one of the hostages  is notable for the comic relief he provides  his character is initially so slimy  and giamatti himself just looks so shifty  that you expect to laugh before he even says anything  fortunately  this doesnt distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film  but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout  j  t  walsh  as the suspicious internal affairs inspector  clocks in with one of his final performances  sadly  the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year  and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film  walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam  backdraft  and nixon  for one of his best performances  check out sling blade  in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton  when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march  walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success  the actors performed together in a few good men   the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh  and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role  it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing  in the end  the negotiator has a plotline that parallels its reality  were served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best  as an audience  were also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie  and wed like to see if one will dominate the film  both provide some pretty good entertainment  
1	after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction  jackie brown seems like something of a lighthearted departure for quentin tarantino  its more of a hohum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language  luckily  his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen  and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer  the story introduces us to a streetwise black woman named jackie brown  pam grier   a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another  she works for a bottomofthebarrel airline and receives a minimal salary  but one day  she is picked up by a pair of federal officials  including michael keaton as the toughnosed ray nicolet   and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope  jackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell  samuel l  jackson   who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation  soon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle 500  000 through to them under nicolets nose  with the help of ordells oaf of a partner  robert de niro  and druggedout lady friend  bridget fonda   also entering the picture is a bailbondsman named max cherry  robert forster   who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated  how i wont say   the big dropoff is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown  in which numerous doublecrosses take place and many clothing store bags  filled with cash  switch hands  its unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there  and doesnt offer anything extremely compelling while doing so  there are  as always  amusing exchanges between characters  the funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda  as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq  or lack thereof  the most interesting relationship is between max and jackie  a 56year old white bail bondsman and a 44year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry  youve got to commend the acting  jackie brown is a seriously draggedout exercise enlivened by such fine acting  the film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours  35 minutes  tarantinos talky style manages to hold your attention heavily  but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline  also  fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear  jackie brown has four major shootings  and two of those take place mostly offscreen  so dont be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath  you can expect frequent foul language  mostly coming way of ordell  who  much to the dismay of spike lee  uses the n word as part of his regular vocabulary  the acting is the glue that holds everything together  grier  making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970s  is more than adequate for the title character  in fact  shes flatout great  another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster  who does a grand job as max cherry  and is perfectly cast in doing so  michael keaton makes his presence felt  albeit in small but dignified moments  and de niro is ideal in playing the lughead who goes over the edge  speaking of that  bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordells bikiniclad beach babe  and yet she manages to look fairly occupied  theres not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie  which is a lifesaver for mr  tarantino  the story barely holds together in the meantime  and we merely get a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake  but oh well  jackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino  even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work  lets just hope that the director hasnt gone soft on us  
0	i never understood what the clich   hell on earth  truly meant until very recently  ive just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying  so horrible  so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as  hell on earth   after all  ive never been to war  ive never been the victim of any violent crime  ive never really been broken hearted  and ive never been audited  so i really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was  hell on earth  then i saw cruel intentions  in a perfect world  i would be in charge of all the movie studios  the very first thing id do in this perfect world  would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with a 20something cast playing teenagers and featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv  and throw them in jail  but it wouldnt just be your average jail  not even a maximum security installation  id have these producers  and everyone else involved in the production of these films  put in front of a war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity  now youre probably thinking to yourself   is this really how bad cruel intentions is   the answer is no  its actually much worse  watching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumbles awfully written script is probably a lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with a chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound  and then pouring acid on the salt  i dont know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum  tara reid  whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet  but the only emotion i felt was sheer boredom  from that opening scene  where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz  to the conclusion which i dont remember because i had practically fallen asleep  cruel intentions is truly  hell on earth   right up there with war and tax audits  
0	getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity  the film was directed by randal kleiser  who brought us such bubblegum classics as grease and the blue lagoon  but thanks to kleisers surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script  getting it right is a pleasantly quiet  moving  and memorable filmone geared strictly toward a sophisticated  adult audience  getting it right stars jesse birdsall  emily lloyds boyfriend in wish you were here  as gavin  a painfully shy 31yearold hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and whogaspis still a virgin  gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon  but expose him to a single 30yearold beauty and hes a mess  much to gavins surprise  the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan  lynn redgrave   a rich  married  and lonely 45yearold  getting it right is the simple story of gavins awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right  that is  to find the right woman to fulfill his life  getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to indepth character development  gavins selfconscious voiceover narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche  we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and selfconfident maturity  birdsalls superb  understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film  he seems convincing and authentic throughout  the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavins life  despite her limited screen time  redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavins middleaged seducer  for a supporting character  joan is unusually and impressively complex  thanks in large part to redgraves magnificent performance  gavin is also pursued  or perhaps plagued  by minnie  the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat  after minnie and gavin meet at a party  she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life  helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role  and sir john gielgud  with his tongue in his cheek  embodies the height of arrogance as her father  gavins eventual loveinterest is jenny  the adorable twentyyearold single mother who assists him at the beauty salon  london stage actress jane horrocks fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character  peter cook  the great british satirist  appears briefly in the film as gavins uptight employer  the scenes of gavins home life with his parents are also a treat  gavins overprotective mother  pat heywood   whom even woody allen would find overbearing  almost steals the movie  her life seems limited to just two activities  treating gavin like a 10yearold and preparing exotic but inedible meals  such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate sauce  gavin and his fathers attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing  getting it right  for the most part  is very wellcrafted  except for two minor shortcomings  first  the movie is about 15 minutes too long  and consequently it loses momentum at times  second  the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavins best friend  harry  and his unfaithful lover  winthrop  overall  however  getting it right is quite memorable for its humor  depth  sophistication  and outstanding acting  director kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard  adapting her own highly acclaimed novel  deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth  maturation  and selfdiscovery  
0	the happy bastards quick movie review analyze this how does one do a comedy focused on the mob  well  a few years ago  there was a sly little comedy called the freshman  which had marlon brando doing a romp of a sendup of his famous don corleone character and  recently  the utterly stupid  in a bad way  movie mafia  failed to really get the joke  this time around  however  warner bros  may have gotten it right with analyze this  a movie that hits its targets more than it misses    and for plenty of reasons  the story goes like this  a mobster  robert deniro  finds himself receiving several panic attacks as of late  fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting and a neardeath following a driveby shooting  its these attacks that prompt him to hire a psychiatrist  billy crystal  whos mostly reluctant to take the mobsters case for two reasons  first  of course  hes a mobster  but secondly  hes trying to get married and enjoy a quiet honeymoon with his wife  lisa kudrow  and kid  and  of course  he cant rest worth for a moment because the mobsters goons are always needing the shrink for something  be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation  fortunately  the movie is played out for plenty of laughs  director harold ramis  who also helmed the comedy multiplicity  which wasnt half bad  keeps the tone peppy and light  even if its sometimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments  shootings cant always be taken for laughs  you know   deniro does some of his finest comic work since the king of comedy  giving off a somewhat similar performance to his role in goodfellas  but with a bit of a lighter heart    a scene where he tries to display his anger over the phone and fails miserably is hilarious   crystal plays an excellent straight man to deniros character  uplifting him from such bombs as fathers day and my giant  kudrow is also a hoot as crystals wifetobe  whos on the verge of a breakdown thanks to deniros presence  is the movie perfect  not really  thanks to a simplistic ending and some slightly wasted moments with a character portrayed by chazz palminteri  hes a comic actor  too  come on  give him some more    but it is an enjoyable romp that lets deniro do something different but same for a change  taking his dramatic act to a new field of comedy  kudos to crystal and kudrow for not just making it his show  either  line of the movie  crystal   when you said you needed family therapy  this is not the family i had in mind   
1	as the film opens up  expectant unwed mother sally  played by drew barrymore  encounters her babys father in a fast food drivethrough window  after he gets his milkshake  he drives off  only to be pursued by a military helicopter  from this moment forward  you know that this isnt going to be your runofthemill romantic comedy  home fries tells the tale of the relationship between sally and dorian  played by luke wilson   a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection with sally    more than he would care to admit  hint  it has something to do with the father of sallys unborn child   after taking a personal  and professional  interest in her  he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works  and the fun goes on from there  this movie is a lot of fun  it is comedic on two levels  as a romantic comedy and a dark comedy  the romantic moments are sweet  yet not sappy  one of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes  however  the dark comedic moments are more memorable  this is also a tale of revenge  and a funny one at that  the father of sallys unborn child also happened to be a married man  whose wife is played by catherine ohara  she does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair  and is not above getting other people to do her dirty work    my apologies if this sounds cryptic  but there is too much of the plot to give away   rounding out the cast are jake busey as angus  dorians overzealous brother and daryl mitchell as roy  dorians trainer at the fast food restaurant  the dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones  even with the romantic nature of the plot  if there are any complaints  it is over drew barrymores performance  while she does light up the screen  there are moments when she doesnt seem all that convincing  the movie was filmed in texas  and most of the characters have southern texan accents  drew barrymores accent tends to come and go  luke wilson doesnt seem to have this problem   as well  she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant  still  this movie is one that will please many viewers  with plot twists galore and hilarious dark moments  this is sure to entertain  
0	14 years ago  national lampoon introduced us to a new family  the griswolds  in 1983  the griswolds embarked on a crosscountry journey with the destination of wally world  a worldrenowned theme park in california  we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured  two years later  we watched again as they went to europe  and four years after that  we shared christmas with them  now  eight more years have passed  and the laughs have done more than die  theyve been cremated  vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold  the good intentioned but illfated father of two  the premise is basically the same  clark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation  this time to las vegas  his wife ellen  beverly dangelo  and teenage kids rusty and audrey  always played by different actors  this time around  by ethan embry and marisol nichols  respectively  join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick  of course a  vacation  movie wouldnt be complete without good ole eddie  reprised by randy quaid   the misfit cousin  showing up at all the wrong times  there isnt too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it  its really just a skit movie  there are a couple of ways to define a skit movie  which is not a real term as far as i know  the first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours  therefore coming off like a two hour skit  the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits  each lasting about five minutes  vegas vacation comes off like the first  a good example of the latter would be last years black sheep  the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast  and it doesnt really fit into a movie mold  in these cases  a  plot   which is generally very thin  is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags  i  e  have a good vegas joke  make a vegas movie   such is the case with this movies miniplots  clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswolds money  ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton     rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage  and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie  shae dlyn  as an exotic dancer  the simple fact is  this movie isnt funny  at first  i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes  but when the movie got rolling  my interest suddenly stopped  chase plays clark griswold really well  he made the character and he is the character  dangelo  to be quite honest  never was too impressive as ellen  and this movie doesnt show any signs of redemption  as for the two new griswold kids  the word  blah  comes to mind  the  vacation  series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters  the simple reason being that there is nothing to them  theyre so generic  youll expect the credits to read  girl 1 as audrey griswold   vegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor  yes  its true that vegas vacation isnt even close to being close to being as funny as the others  which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways  but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart  first off  why did they leave off the national lampoons heading on the title  i couldnt find any reasons why  but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didnt want to be associated with such a lame film  thats saying a lot  especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented  loaded weapon 1  pcu  etc  if they expected this to be another hit  you would assume theyd be proud to tack on the notorious header  but for reasons only we can guess at  like the movie sucking  they didnt  there is another difference here that makes an obvious impact  the first three films in the  vacation  series were written by john hughes  a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80s including mr  mom  sixteen candles  the breakfast club  weird science  pretty in pink  ferris buellers day off  planes  trains  and automobiles  and uncle buck  wowzers  what a r  sum   looking at the names  youd think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980s  well thats not all  this guy also brought us 90s hits including the home alone series  the remake of 101 dalmatians  dennis the menace  and the current flubber  vegas vacation  however  didnt have john hughes behind it  and the loss is very obvious  this time around  the script is in the hands of elisa bell  whose only credits thus far include four madefortv movies  vegas vacation plays very much like one  and it would actually work much better as a madefortv sequel  if this sounds like a wild idea  its not  revenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies  and they seemed like it  vegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2  00 a  m  sunday morning movie  but as a silver screen major motion picture  its quite out of place  stephen kesslers jejune direction doesnt help things either  he only makes the film even more tvmovieish  each consecutive  vacation  movie has suffered a drop in directing power  we started the series off with harold ramis  who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as cowriting ghostbusters  not too bad  then we had national lampoons european vacation being directed by amy heckerling  who would go on to direct the hits look whos talking and clueless  as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high  lastly we had national lampoons christmas vacation  directed by jeremiah s  chechik  who went on to direct the charming benny  joon  kessler  so far  has one title under his belt  the short film birch street gym  which received an oscar nomination in 1992  granted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film  we can allow for some amateurish quality  but instead we get a movie straight from the text book  boring  bland  and deeply unoriginal  if you loved the  vacation  movies  and i know  some  of us did  there still isnt anything here worth seeing  if you loved them  dont ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte  if you never did like the series  why the need to confirm why

1	zero effect gets its title from the main character  daryl zero  bill pullman   although we dont understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film  zero is a private investigator  perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived  at least hed like to think so   however  hes a socially inept being  and eccentric in every possible way  this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are  zeros accomplice is steve arlo  ben stiller   a  normal  guy who does the business side of the job  hes the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zeros greatness as an investigator  the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zeros talents to soontobe client gregory stark  ryan oneal   it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box  and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about  zero takes the case  and the plot thickens  his path leads to a young  pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan  kim dickens   despite her luminous and seeminglyharmless presence  she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark  through his investigations  zero learns why  but not without developing feelings for gloria  feelings that  because of his reclusive behavior  are new and confusing to him  i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film  i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators  and  every once in a while  a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away  actually  no private eye film has ever reached chinatowns greatness   zero effect  which is jake kasdans first effort as writerdirector  is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts  its an original  funny  and completely involving motion picture  with so many cliches available to this genre  i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them  but he didnt just successfully avoid flaws  he has created a great film here  one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment  take  for starters  the great cast of characters  pullman is terrific as zero  showing a comic flair that i really havent seen from him since spaceballs  zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here  the fact that hes an almost exaggeratedly twisted  emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe  pullmans performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance  and the occasional voiceover as hes going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious  ben stiller is also a very funny individual  hes the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny    ill shoot you   he says to stark at one point    i have a gun  and everything   his character is also welldrawn  with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend  angela featherstone  who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job  oneal also gives his character a bit of depth  and kim dickens  last seen  and underused  in mercury rising  gets a chance to show us her talent here  giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs  i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film  kasdans humor is of the best kind  soft spoken  and mostly dialoguedriven  though there are some great visual jokes   its the kind of humor thats funny even after youve seen it five or six times  theres one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is  an how that makes him such a great detective  what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed  or standing motionlessly  with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face  his eyes pointing to something off camera  but obviously to nothing in particular  i cant convey to you how funny this is  but what makes it great film making is that it has a point  scenes like this are frequent  and they provide solid characterization of zero  as a side note  i dont consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy  not to sound elitist   i find things funny that many do not  and vice versa  there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film  and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it  i have a feeling the humor here wont appeal to everyone  but theres certainly enough story and character development to keep anyones interest  jake kasdan  son of writerdirector lawrence kasdan  is only 22 years old  i found this out after seeing the film  and i cant remember ever being so impressed with a film maker  his direction is stylish without being pretentious  and his writing is mature  full  and developed  zero effect is the kind of film that ill buy for my collection  smart  original films like this are rare as it is  but this one actually has a heart and a soul  at the end of the film  i was involved in the characters  and i was satisfied with the outcome  and  with kasdans undeniable talent at such a young age  all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future  
0	as the small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach normandy on dday  the weary  seasick soldiers take a deep breath and open the large protective shield at the back of the boat  they are unaware of exactly what is going to happen  one man kisses the crucifix that hangs around his neck  as the flap falls  the battle begins  they are trapped like rats in a cage and proceed to be blown to pieces in the wake of enemy gunfire  amid the chaos of this massacre  stands a shot that  at least for me  hangs in the air like the girl in the little red coat in schindlers list  a soldier  clearly missing an arm  wanders around the bodystrewn beach like a lost puppy  we are not invited to know what he is searching for until he finds it himself  he bends over  picks up his arm and starts to carry it  probably not bothering to ask himself   what now   saving private ryan is a masterfully composed film  the direction is out of this world  surely the type of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar  the cinematography  by janusz kaminsky  is also astounding  but be forewarned  this is the most violent and graphic film i have ever seen  the articles you read and the warnings you see are justified  saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get  the question is   does the story and its realism justify the excessive use   the answer from my point of view is  no   braveheart was a truly gritty  and  one would imagine  realistic battle film  ryan is ten times worse  expect disembowelments  sucked in skulls  heads blown to bits  arms and legs flying across the battlefield  many in the theater could not bear to watch  and it is a shame  too  because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year  but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters  and academy members   saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on dday  1944  through into the films primary mission  captain miller  hanks  assembles an 8 man crew and sets off to find a missing solider  private ryan  whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield  the government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs  ryan doesnt recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons  that no person should suffer such injustice  millers crew is not in favor of the mission and they begin to harbor a secret hatred for ryan  though they dont yet know him  they resent having to trudge out to bring home one soldier who doesnt have any more or less right to live than any of them  this film manages to keep up a rapid pace and  though there is a lot of set up between battles  the story continues full speed to the end  the pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of its own  spielberg  though not a student of the  quick cut  school of filmmaking  takes a stab at it here  and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it  bay should pay close attention  take copious notes  if you want to jump cut every two seconds  do it the way spielberg does it in ryan  in the end  the extremity of the gory violence is not justified by the  importance  of the film  schindlers list taught many people the truth about the holocaust  it opened eyes  sparked debate and study  though the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before  they dont amount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindlers list  overall  this is just the truest depiction of the old adage   war is hell   but braveheartdosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately  and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve to see it again some day and realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again  masterful work marred only by excessive gore  
1	this is crap  but  honestly  what older american audience is going to be able to resist seeing jack lemmon and james garner as bicker ing expresidents  especially when their supporting players in clude dan aykroyd as the current commander in chief  lauren bacall as a former first lady  and john heard as the dan quayleish vice president  yup  youre talkin presold property here and  for warner brothers  the perfect fit into their nowritual grumpy old men holiday slot  for the nondiscriminating viewer  my fellow americans is fine  the raw star power alone will have audiences applauding this atrocious political thriller roadcomedy    they did in mine  heaven help us   for the rest of us  the movie is immediately tiresome  the tone is terrible and the banter is worse  forget wit lemmon and garner merely exchange profanities through most of the movie    has anyone counted the number of first penis references   sure  some of the bits are absurdly funny  including a mens room macarena joke  the appearance of an elvis impersonator on a trainload of tarheels  and an all dorothy marching band performing  over the rainbow  at a gay mens march  the get there from here  though  you have to submit to one of the most offensively overbearing musical scores of all time  judas priest  is there a single moment of silence in this film  even the dialogue gets drowned out  what a waste  
0	so  its thirty years later  and oscar and felix are together again  that might have been an exciting notion if it wasnt for the fact that the  odd couple  of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies  1993s  grumpy old men   1995s  grumpier old men   and 1997s  out to sea   i  e    grumpiest old men    so   the odd couple ii   i  e    the grumpiest old men of all  really   seems just another entry in a tired series  the plot is even similar to that of  grumpy old men  in that lemmon and matthaus mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children  oscars son  jonathan silverman  and felixs daughter  lisa waltz  are getting married  and former roommates felix ungar  lemmon  and oscar madison  matthau  meet at the airport and decide to share a car      then hilarity ensues  well  a few chuckles ensue anyway  neil simon  the awardwinning playwright who created oscar and felix  provides the screenplay  which is a shock  because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end  unlike the original playmovie   odd couple ii  doesnt find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters  instead  it depends upon a series of humorous situations  oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff  are caught smuggling mexicans over the border  take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands  the women are played by christine baranski of  cybill  and jean smart of  designing women    and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert  the original 1968 movie  the odd couple  remains a classic comedy  it introduced the motif of roommateasspouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since  it was the second outing for the lemmonmatthau team  which debuted in 1966s  the fortune cookie    and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies   the front page   1974  and  buddy buddy   1981   before going their separate ways  the reunion of lemmon and matthau in  grumpy old men  six years ago was delightful  and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie  but  out to sea  and  the odd couple ii  are just beating a grumpy old horse    you can add lemmons  my fellow americans   i  e    grumpy old presidents   to that list  too   lets hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do  lets hope also that we see neil simons name on movies that do it justice  this is his first since 1993s  lost in yonkers

0	i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year  when matthew perry had just signed on  im big fan of perrys subtle sense of humor  and in addition  i think chris farleys onedge  extreme acting was a riot  so naturally  when the trailer for  almost heroes  hit theaters  i almost jumped up and down  a soda in hand  the lights dimming  i was ready to be blown away by farleys final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perrys big breakthrough  i was ready to be just amazed  for this to be among farleys best  in spite of david spades absence  i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran  sadly  none of this came to pass  the humor is spotty at best  with good moments and laughable oneliners few and far between  perry and farley have no chemistry  the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade  for its his type of humor  and not at all what perry is associated with  and the movie tries to be smart  a subject best left alone when its a farley flick  the movie is a major dissapointment  with only a few scenes worth a first look  let alone a second  perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie  and not surprisingly  the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley  and farleys classic humor is widespread  too  almost heroes almost works  but misses the wagontrain by quite a longshot  guys  lets leave the exploring to lewis and clark  huh  stick to  tommy boy   and well all be  friends   
0	urban legend surprised me  based on the last few films the genre has produced  including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer  disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween  h20   i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena  thankfully  legend rose above its soggy premise to become not only a hip  scary and stylish entertainment  but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year  youre all familiar with the plot  a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac whos identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be  you guessed it  everybodys favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks    the only person you didnt suspect  however  just because legend doesnt really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it cant qualify as firstclass entertainment  it was  believe it or not  one of the funnest times ive had at the movies all year  the thing is  im not really sure what made this particular stab  pardon the pun  at the genre seem so fresh and alive  maybe it was the abovepar performances by the movies two leads  jared leto and  cybil  actress alicia witt   or  it could have been the on target direction by jamie blanks  more likely  though  it was because of the inspired premise  i dont think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman  urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener  not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film  a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when  gasp   a gas problem  heehee  forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill  one problem  though  would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif  i thought not  predictably  the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company  its odd  though  when you pick up a phone to realize that nobodys on the other line  naturally  the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off  and the when we least expect it    whack    a decapitation  it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car  so who is it this time  the obvious candidate is the slightly offkilter professor at the college the girl went to  none other than freddy kruger himself  robert englund   who teaches a class on urban legends  aha  or could it be the famehungry local journalist  leto  looking for a meaty story to put on his resume  like all movies of this nature  one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit  and it turns out to be  of course  the one you didnt suspect  im not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is  but i must give credit where credit is due  and this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been    fun    complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi  ca 
0	any movie that kills emilio estevez off in the first fifteen minutes has something going for it  unfortunately  this and the familiar theme music are the only worthwhile things about mission impossible  directed by brian depalma  the first problem is that this film has absolutely no connection with the tv show whatsoever  aside from the music  the tv show was about an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork  orchestrated by jim phelps  allowed them to counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world  teamwork was the key  this film is set up as a cross between james bond and depalmas  blow out   where the john travolta character was the victim of real and imagined conspiracies from all directions  it was travoltas vulnerability that made that film so exciting and claustrophobic  in this film  tom cruise is basically omniscient  believe that   and so theres no fun going on here whatsoever  the story is about as contrived as contrived gets  and is full of holes  there are basically two memorable sequences  one involves breaking into a kubrickesque computer room  a task that could have been made much easier had the characters a whit of common sense  suffice it to say that the alarm system is disengaged when the computer operator is in the room   the second involves a highspeed train  a helicopter  and the chunnel and does not have to be seen to be disbelieved  the actors are all miscast  especially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wife  who cannot act  and ving rhames as a computer hacker     who looks lost and embarrased to be in this movie  tom cruise is no james bond  and jon voight looks more like bobby  the brain  heenan than jim phelps  brian depalmas career has been bafflingly erratic  at his best  he beats hitchcock at his own game   blow out    carrie    body double   but this is not his best  the screenplay was partly written by robert towne  who wrote the best scenario of the seventies in  chinatown   but this script is perfunctory at best  and terrrible at worst  the cinematography has a comic book redblue emphasis  which is nice to look at  but the suspense sequences are all telegraphed and this movie even features the old  killer who talks too much before shooting thus giving the victim time to think of an escape  trick  please dont spend your money on this  itll only encourage hollywood to make more  
1	  jaws  is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen  the movie opens with blackness  and only distant  alienlike underwater sounds  then it comes  the first ominous bars of composer john williams now infamous score  dahdum  from there  director steven spielberg wastes no time  taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly  right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean  and once  jaws  has attacked  it never relinquishes its grip  perhaps what is most outstanding about  jaws  is how spielberg builds the movie  he works it like a theatrical production  with a first act and a second act  unlike so many modern filmmakers  he has a great deal of restraint  and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act  until then  he merely suggests its presence with creepy  subjective underwater shots and williams music  hes building the tension bit by bit  so when it comes time for the climax  the sharks arrival is truly terrifying  he doesnt let us get bored with the imagery  the first act opens with police chief martin brody  roy scheider   a new york cop who has taken an easy  peaceful job running the police station on amity island  a fictitious new england resort town where there hasnt been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years  the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july  and the mayor  larry vaughn  murray hamilton   doesnt want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money  brody is joined by matt hooper  richard dreyfuss   a young  ambitious shark expert from the marine institute  hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it  his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark   its a perfect engine  an eating machine   make it that much more terrifying  when vaughn finally relents  hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint  robert shaw  on his decrepit boat  the orca  to search for the shark  the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark  and inevitably  are hunted by it    jaws  is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing  tension  and horror  it is like ten movies all rolled into one  and its no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975  taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time  until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by  star wars    even today  fascination with this film is on par with hitchcocks  psycho   and it never seems to age  although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences  including several mechanical sharks  obsolete  none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill  the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing  characterization  sharp editing  and creative photography  instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects  scheider  dreyfuss  and shaw were known actors at the time  jaws  was made  but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman  nevertheless  this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark  scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing whats right and going against the entire town    its your first summer here  you know   mayor vaughn warns him  dreyfuss  who had previously been seen in  american graffiti   1973  and  the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz   1974  gives a surprisingly mature  complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers  however  most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movies captain ahab  a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards  bordering of parody  shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism  hes slightly deranged  and shaws performance is almost a caricature  however  there is one scene late in the film  when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars  quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u  s  s  indianapolis  a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese  his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1  000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hairraising than anything spielberg put on screen  shaw delivers the story in one long take  and it is the best acting in the film  of course  we cant leave out the shark itself  with its black eyes  endless rows of teeth  and insatiable urge to eat  it is basically the epitome of all mankinds fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature  a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real  having survived sinch the dinosaurs  great whites do exist  they can be as large as the shark in  jaws   and they are a threat  every one of spielbergs subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark  a bunch of writihing  dangling  completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into  the shark in  jaws  was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks  all nicknamed  bruce  by the crew  built to be shot from different angles  many have forgotten  but  jaws  was a sort of precursor to  waterworld   1995   a movies who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb  but  as we can see now  spielberg overcame all the obstacles  and delivered one of the finest primal scarethrillers ever to come out of hollywood  
1	jake kasdan  son of one of the best screenwriters around  breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hardtocategorize detective story  part mystery  part comedy  part character study and part romance  for the most part  kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film  daryl zero  bill pullman  is a modern day sherlock holmes  the parallel is present down to his love of music  though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin   and his addiction to drugs  amphetamines  rather than morphine   he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces  the case about the man who lied about his age  or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes  however zeros observance of the fine art of detachment  though it makes him a brilliant private investigator  makes him somewhat of a selfimposed outcast in society  he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr  watson  i mean steve arlo  ben stiller   arlo is not happy with his job  he is thrilled to be around zeros brilliance  but his bizarre behavior  and strange requests  are frustrating to the former lawyer  and theyre even more so to his girlfriend  jess  angela featherstone   who is fed up that her boyfriends boss means more to arlo than her  this is the situation when a new case comes knocking  gregory stark  ryan oneill  hires zero to find his lost keys  it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring  and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence  now  stark is being blackmailed  and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end  to solve this case  zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell  however  this is when he is vulnerable    and this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic  gloria sullivan  kim dickens   who may be involved in the blackmail scheme  for the first time  zero has to question his own objectivity  as he finds his client less and less sympathetic  zero effect is weakest in its obviously  wacky  scenes depicting daryl zeros odd behavior  such scenes might be appropriate in an outandout satire  making zero an ace venturaish character  however  theres a much meatier movie in here    it just takes a while to get out  thats not to say that theres not a place for humor in this film  in fact  some of the best scenes are ben stillers wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer  however  the overthetop scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film  and they arent funny enough to stand on their own  once the investigation is underway  however  zeros brilliance really begins to shine  his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlocks own  as the mystery begins to unfold  zeros deductions lead the plot in interesting directions  but never lose the viewer  zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well  zeros relationship with gloria is lowkey  but it hits all the right notes  however  we are always kept distant from glorias character  shes given plenty of development  but we never understand what she is thinking  perhaps that may be intentional  to place the audience in zeros zone of detachment  but  on the whole  it is frustrating  bill pullman  when hes not spacing out  creates a vibrant character in daryl zero  theres one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years  and it is shockingly moving    expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character  but one which fits in well  and  although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called  zero  seriously  it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name  although zero effect is a bit awkward in places  it is a strong debut for kasdan  and shows great promise

1	plot  a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon  to whom hes devoted a tribute band in which he sings  gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place  critique  im a sucker for movies like this  a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams  works hard  devotes the time  the energy and the patience  and ultimately hits it bigtime  in the case of this film  our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it  yup  luck always finds its way into these types of equations  although generally tied very closely to hard work   they need a new singer  his entry and adaptation to the whole  rock n roll  lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch  although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love  or past love  of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it  metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isnt that prominent anymore  i still check out my motley crue  twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again  thats not to say that you wont like this film if you dont like the music  but the music and live performances from the band  play a big part in the movie  and i for one  had a blast watching and listening to it all  but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg  wow  hand this fella some major props  as he totally becomes this heavy metal geekgod  incidentally  metal god was the films original title  and a much better one if you ask me   he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through  he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic  who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams  aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend  and the romance angle between them was sweet   but she didnt pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes  i was also impressed by some of the  real  musicians who played in the film  zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne  jeff pilson from dokken  stephan jenkins from third eye blind  blas elias from slaughter   but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members  its to note that this film was based on a reallife tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer  their original singer also admitted to being gay  as in this film   just for the record  im certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements  since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies  but because its a fun  uplifting  wellpaced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances  oh yeah  and for those who dig the  heavier  side of music  the soundtrack also rocks   you see    dreams can come true    wheres joblo coming from  almost famous  810   blow  810   boogie nights  910   detroit rock city  810   girlfight  610   goodfellas  1010  
0	as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it  the more pleased i was when i left  first  getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz   if you liked scream  youll love wild things     campbell gives a stunning performance     this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days     oh yeah  the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me  now  onto more serious stuff  and with this film  i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way   wild things has singlehandedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa  im not saying that in a bad way  but when you see this film  you may be shocked by what you see  however  perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the films charming cast and tricky plot  that they let the film slide with an r rating  being mormon  im bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film  trouble is  i have already seen it  and i like it  wild things is a film noir of the 90s  filled with 40s sensibilities  and yet breaking the rules and modernday taboos of 90s culture  the style in which it is filmed is rich in color  the actors are all gorgeous people  seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film  sure  its all too good to be true  but aint it fun to watch  when movies like this come along  sort of a better version of basic instinct  there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it  there will be people who dont want to admit liking what they see  but i tell you  most anyone who sees this will like it  wild things begins at blue bay high school  the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into  its almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance  totally based on looks alone   of course  there are those select few who may look slightly ugly  but compared to the average person  they are gorgeous  immediately  the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time  we can turn off our brains  right  wrong  while you may be expecting one thing to happen  it certainly doesnt turn out that way  the film begins in a classroom  with nearly all the main characters present  theres sam lombardo  matt dillon   a counselor for the students  hes heading the class discussion  theres also kelly van ryan  denise richards   a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam  teaching the class  however  are two policemen  ray duquette  kevin bacon  and gloria perez  daphne rubinvega   who want to talk about sex      cheers  crimes  boos      what is a sex crime   ray asks    not gettin any   one student responds  this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch  however  upon hearing this  one student  suzie toller  neve campbell   stands up and leaves the room  commenting that they can both kiss part of her body  and so  wild things sets into motion  quickly  kelly begins hitting on sam  but sam doesnt want anything to do with her advances  kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him  she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep  surprisingly  thats really all i can tell you about the plot  any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists  and whats more  these plot twists are actually unpredictable  going along the way of scream  wild things maintains that films surprises  and then adds even more to them  there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen  and even though you think you may get tired of them  the surprises are so genuine that its rather pleasing  going back over them in my mind  nearly all of them work  though some stretch the boundaries of belief  thankfully  the convoluted plot doesnt give us much time to think about each one  pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off  as for the critics who complain that the film is trashywell  it is  this is pretty much just one trashy film  however  it is the kind of trashy that isnt hard to watch  its good trash  in a sense  one  the screenplay knows that its not to be taken seriously  and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story  this varies everywhere from kellys mother  theresa russell   who is more of a caricature of rich people  all the way to an ambulancechasing lawyer  bill murray   who wears a neckbrace to cover an insurance scam he is running  bill murray also provides the best character in the film  and most of the genuine laughs  and two  the sex is more than gratuitous  although not unwelcomed  wild things is supposed to have sex in it  what film with that title wouldnt    and this movie breaks the boundaries  instead of having heterosexual sex scenes  it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell  dont worry    its not as graphic as you might think   the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic  but the surprise shocker is kevin bacons fullfrontal nude scene  its very brief  so if you blink  you may miss  ahem  it  and  for as long as i can remember  i dont think i have seen an rrated film show an erect one before  its not completely  but judging from the audiences reaction  it was more than they expected too   also  during one scene late in the film  there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillons characters  but nothing came of it  makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating  or if the actors refused to do it   what first made me want to see wild things was its cast  neve campbell  of course  has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released  here  however  she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead  the closest role to this was her performance in the craft  though even in that she was a nice girl   campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent  you can tell she will be around for a long time  denise richards will also be around for a long time  although she may be limited to the roles without much range  here  she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff  yet effective  performance in starship troopers  hopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability  and then there is daphne rubinvega  a newcomer to the movies  she gives a very good performance  although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half  towards the end she does get a bigger part  on the male side  matt dillon is probably the best  giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist  kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character  but he makes the most of it  you must have admiration  though  for what he did on screen  and judging from many of the womens reactions in the theater to that shot  they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon  yeah  right   and then there is bill murray  his performance is the comic relief  and he nearly steals the film  as a whole  the entire cast works wondrously together  and they seem at home  even when doing the menage a troi  director john mcnaughton  who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry  portrait of a serial killer  has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works  his direction is smooth and stylish  the visuals are striking  filled with rich colors  and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air  however  he seems more at home when the actors arent talking  his flyby shots of the swampy areas are brilliant  and his photography of denise richards climbing out of the pool is a highlight  the cinematography is gorgeous in its details  its not often that you see a film like this  and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures  then  there is the music  this was probably the most obvious thing to me  as it set the perfect mood for the film  its hard to describe in words  so just see the film and listen to it  its wonderfully composed and presented  and be sure to stick around during the closing credits  mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use  while most comedies use it for outtakes   he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events  some may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot  but its an entertaining way to finish the film  plus  there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun  wild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality  nudity  language and violence  again  the nudity is rather unnecessary  but lets face itpeople want to see it  so why not give it to them  neve campbell  admirably  has a nonudity clause in her contract  and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off  way to go  neve    the sex scenes are graphic  especially the first one we see  between the mother and one of her deck hands  one almost wonders how they got away with the r rating  the language is quite harsh too  ranging from sexual innuendo to your average  everyday profanity  and i cant stress it enough  dont allow kids under 18 to see this film  the target age for the movie is the 1824 range  and thats who should see it  its definitely not for those under 18  did i mention that this film is rated r  however  for those that do get a chance to watch it  you will probably more likely be pleased  and may even take friends to see it the next time  
1	chris tucker is one of those guys you immediately get a reaction from  you either find his helium voice  crazy eyes and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying  i think i fall into the former category  im one of the few who thought his turn in  the fifth element  as a prancing  princelike deejay was complete inspired lunacy and not the least bit aggravating   but his new vehicle  money talks  just doesnt do him service  tucker is good in the movie  and this is the kind of film that  if people see it  could make him a big star  but hes also really the only thing good about the movie  in fact  if you see  money talks   it should shock you beyond recognition that two of  toy story  s writers penned the sloppy script  tuckers role here is that of franklin hatchett  a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell  charlie sheen   after being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports  franklin finds himself on a bus to the county jail and handcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard  gerard ismael   but villards thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader  never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him   and because he and franklin are joined at the wrist  franklin is allowed to escape as well  but not before overhearing some important information regarding a diamond stash that  for some reason or another  is being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo  the local media mistakenly puts the prison breakout blame on franklin  which is where james comes back into the picture  he makes a deal to protect franklin if  in turn  franklin gives him an exclusive interview  this means james must present his new  friend  in the stickiest of situations  a formal dinner party for he and fiancee grace  heather locklear   also attended by her uberrich parents  veronica cartwright and nicely game paul sorvino   and of course the bad guys track franklin down and try to knock him off  all the while he spars and forms an unlikely bond with james    this aint no buddy movie   claim the print ads  yeah  right  actually  for the better part of  oh  20 minutes  it appears  money talks  has the momentum to cover entertaining ground  and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker  this is tuckers first leading role  and if you imagine a slightly lankier  africanamerican jim carrey with a reliance on wild rrated raunch rather than pg13 physical comedy  you have a good idea of the conviction with which he assaults the role  but you realize all too quickly that tuckers overstated liveliness is the only thing  money talks  has going for it  and a lively actor alone does not a successful movie make  its all too easy to pick out everything wrong with  money talks   the plot is recycled buddybuddy comedythriller tripe that seemed overused even when  nothing to lose  employed it last month  everything is paintbynumbers  especially the los angeles coliseum finale  which finds not one  not two  but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers  the villains  as many as there are  are dull  certain story elements are too coincidental  and too much of the films dramatic agenda is played too straight  a scene where grace confronts james after learning franklins true identity   you brought a killer into my parents house    is extremely silly  you get the picture  obviously  i did not have a pleasant experience at  money talks   but the people around me appeared to be having a riproaring good time  one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing for his health   but tucker  at least for me  is a pretty funny guy  and aces the movies best scene  where franklin passes himself off as vic damones son at james and graces engagement bash and toasts the couple with barry white lyrics  tuckers audience  and he does have one  will probably like  money talks   those who he irritates  however  will have a more productive day staying home and scraping the gook out from under their toenails  
0	this is the movie not the perfume  a slow moving  stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcocks vertigo  it is adapted from an original story by brian de palma and paul schrader  and is directed by de palma and scripted by schrader  set in new orleans  1959  it shows the wealthy michael courtland  cliff robertson  sitting on top of the world  celebrating his tenth wedding anniversary with a party in his mansion  as his lovely wife elizabeth  genevi  ve bujold  and young daughter amy  blackman   both look up to him beaming with joy  his realestate development partner bob la salle  john lithgow  proposes a toast to him and to their prosperous business  while his high society friends give him their best wishes  upon retiring for the night  his daughter and wife are kidnapped in their bedroom and he is left with a ransom note to deliver 500  000 tomorrow or they will be killed  inspector brie  stanley reyes  comes up with a plan to put in phony money and a transmitter in the briefcase exchange  as that will lead them to the kidnappers  but the kidnappers burst out of the house surrounded by the police  taking the two victims with them and in the pursuing police chase  the kidnappers car explodes and goes over the bridge  where none of the bodies were found  grieving the loss of his wife and child  the guiltridden michael builds them a tomb on the expensive land they were to develop  sixteen years later he goes with his partner bob on a vacation and he revisits florence  italy  where he met his wife  when he goes to the church where they met  he sees a young girl who looks exactly like his wife  her name is sandra portinari  genevi  ve bujold  and shes working there restoring art that is decaying  he falls instantly in love with her and doesnt heed bobs warnings that she might be a gold digger and decides to take her back to new orleans and marry her  sandra becomes his second chance to prove his love  as he thinks he can finally put the past behind him  the surprises to come werent really all that surprising  as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson  the emotionally impactful performance by genevi  ve bujold  and the competent acting of john lithgow  it plays too much like a rehash of the masters work  to break any new ground  yet it is still thrilling in its own way

1	lisa cholodenkos  high art   is an intelligent  quiet drama  its strongest quality  aside from the topnotch central performances  is the perceptive way in which the film  also written by cholodenko  observes its characters  they are all flawed people  some more troubled than others  but they are not judged  judging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers parts  because no one  no matter how bad off they are  deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of  syd  radha mitchell   a 24yearold woman living with her longtime boyfriend james  gabriel mann   has recently been awarded an ideal job at the highprofile photography magazine   frame   she very much enjoys where her career is headed  but is often not taken very seriously by her managers  who are always giving her petty jobs to do  when she knows she could be doing more important things  one night  while taking a bath  syd notices a leak coming from the apartment above hers  so when she goes up there to inform them of it  she meets lucy beliner  ally sheedy   a thin  wornout  and unhappy woman  who lives with her drugaddicted german girlfriend  greta  patricia clarkson   a pathetic former actress who is usually so outofit that she often is in and out of conciousness  syd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy  and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before  lucy claims she doesnt want to get back into the profession  but syd manages to convince the  frame  editors to do a piece on her work  all the while  syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy  even though she has never previously been attracted to a woman  and lucy starts a battle with her personal demons    high art   is such an effective motion picture because it is never sugercoated or idealized  but instead an honest and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere  while syds luck begins to rise  the film in no way is about lesbianism  but about love  which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality  as lucy and syd grow closer and closer together  we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other  even if the relationship might be doomed  with this picture  ally sheedys star has risen once again  thanks to her touching  nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy  a woman who  in the course of a decade  has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs  which has taken away her onceblossoming career  her characted really is tragic  and one particular scene involving lucy and her mother  in which lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem  and her mother matteroffactly responds by saying she cant help her  is heartbreaking  although not autobiographical  sheedy has had drug problems in her past  and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucys footsteps to her role  also very good is radha mitchell as syd  who previously starred in the slight 1997 australian comedy   love and other catastrophes   wh caught me by surprise with her performance  easily being able to pass as christina riccis older sister  mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently  as accurate as almost every detail is in   high art   i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd and james  who  played by gabriel mann  is left with a throwaway role  by the time he finds out about syd and lucy  he disappears from the film  and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other  this is a very minor fault  however  in a film that is full of riches  although many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair  syd and lucy are intelligent people who recognize their problems  the character of dominique  anh duong   the  frame  editor who decides to give syd a chance with her ideas  was also written to be far more mature than expected  and the one sex scene in the film was beautifully and originally done  for once  it did not invlove steaminess  or violent sexual activity  or gratuitous nudity  but focused on the actual characters  who love each other  and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex    high art   which won the screenwriting award at the 1998 sundance film festival  marks the superior feature film debut of cholodenko  as well as sheedys strongest  and best  role to date  
0	i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of  good will hunting   based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film  in which the main character will hunting  matt damon   an mit janitor in his early twenties  is discovered to be an einsteinlevel closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight  the only problem is that will is a tough street kid whos had his share of runins with the law  and before long hes being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight  professor lambeau  stellan skarsgard   who had brought up the math problems in his lectures  tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police  will is to be released  provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions  this sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff  but  good will hunting  rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama  a conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and wills therapist sean mcguire  robin williams   lambeau wants to get will to use his brain  while sean wants him to listen to his heart  both of which he has been largely neglecting  will finds that the former is much easier than the latter  so much so  in fact  that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeaus attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle  he also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar  minnie driver   an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her  what makes  good will hunting  work so well  aside from the strong performances  especially from damon and williams   is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in wills life  the scripts sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau  but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong  lambeau  while he may seem a little cold at times  is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when were not sure if we like what he has to say  and sean  for all his warmheartedness  has  as lambeau and later will point out  not lived up to his full intellectual potential either  the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will  wills reaction to this situation  and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean  is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters opinions  rather than setting up an obvious  right  and  wrong  side and beating them over the head with it  for a film with such an extraordinary character   good will hunting  presents itself as remarkably ordinary  it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman  a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another  this film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama  by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally farfetched situation    good will hunting  also has its share of fun humor  such as when will  in an early therapy session  pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture  and in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear  will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa  wills relationship with his friends  most notably chucky  ben affleck   is usually rather amusing  if somewhat crude  the film has 100 uses of the f word  which was most likely the reason for its rrating   and lends itself well to the development of wills character  add all this to the fact that  good will hunting  even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental  and you might be wondering why i havent given this film four stars  well  for one thing  no matter how well damon and affleck  who wrote the screenplay  and director gus van sant pull it off  the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original  there are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic  including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions  still   good will hunting  takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would  and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years  and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of 97 films  
0	i guess its a credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour 2 could not be ruined even by the nauseating  comedy  of chris tucker  im a fan of jackie chan in just about any medium  and this movie lets him not only do his impressiveasever martial arts schtick  but show off his comic timing as well  it would have worked better if he was the only name above the title  the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects  this time around  the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan  john lone   who makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into the united states  im still not sure how you can make a fortune doing that  is there a place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones    the only way to tell the phony money from the genuine article is to set it on fire and see what color it burns  of course  its up to hong kong detective lee  chan  and trashtalking lapd detective james carter  tucker  to take the bad guys out and the authorities  to the extent that they even exist  stay out of their way  rush hour 2 turns the tables on the first film in that here its carter who gets the two of them into trouble and lee who winds up having to get them out  i guarantee that my rating would have been at least a half of a grade higher had anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan  he refuses to shut up  not only did his voice feel like a jackhammer on my head  but his jokes just arent funny  a pathetic mixture of subpar eddie murphy fasttalking blather and wannabe chris rock whitemanblackman jokes that wind up being more offensive than funny  i realize that in a movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates  but didnt anyone realize how irritating tuckers incessant ranting and raving was  if this is all the comedian has to offer then i dont care to see any more of his films  fortunately  chan makes for a marvelous straight man  and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely  its not often that one actor can so completely save a movie  but there is no other name for what he does  whenever hes on screen  rush hour 2 comes to nearly breathtaking  often hilarious  life  much of it hinges on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch chan try to be a  player   but who cares  i can think of few high concepts that are funnier  the movie ends with outtakes that  as usual  show that chan isnt perfect  and that it does  indeed  take him a few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to look seamless  chris tucker botches some lines as well  and his mistakes are funnier than anything he says in the whole movie  a lot of people have pointed out rush hour 2 isnt very different from its predecessor in tone or style  but i liked the original  and i like the sequel  though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it  director brett ratner  the family man  keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes  i guess sometimes the shotgun approach works   its not great jackie chan  but its jackie chan  and thats enough  up next  jay and silent bob strike back

1	ok  lets get one thing straight right away  maximum risk is no battleship potemkin  although it does have some russians in it    but its not too bad  really  its the new film from ringo lam  the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood  and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium  jeanclaude van damme  who  you will recall  also starred in john woos maiden hollywood effort  hard target   in lams film  van damme plays alain moreau  a french cop  at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target  who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians  these russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york  where  i suppose  they thought they wouldnt be noticed   this brother  mikhail suverov  played in his few scenes by    well  you know   becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi  almost the same thing  i guess   and is killed in france  in the movie  things happen so fast that you dont have too much time to think about how weird this all is   moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed  and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed  we wonder the same thing  i still do   in little odessa  he meets mikhails girlfriend  alex  natasha henstridge  last seen in species   who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the miseenscene  she has very nice breasts  and we get to seen them briefly in this movie  it was rated r in the us but is pg here  so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do   this film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow  the fugitive  hard target  or anything starring arnold  but that works to its benefit  i think  after all  one thing thats been missing from woos hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love  well  some of us do   movies like this shouldnt be too pretentious  and that is part of the problem with some of these other films  they try to be too  big  in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle  maximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions  but they dont overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative  not too much  anyway   the emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions  even if  at times  they dont make a hell of a lot of sense   in fact  one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character  a rather overeager new york cabbie  frank van keeken from tvs  kids in the hall    who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story  unfortunately  by the time we have come to really get interested in him  he    well  youll see  the movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots  one is a fight in a russian sauna  with lots of sweaty  muscular male flesh  this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others   bullets in heads  and vodka  another  my personal favorite  is a fight in a meat packing house  featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw  and even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood  as they trash those quaint french cafes  vegetable carts  and  well  french people that  we all know in our hearts  deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint  of course  the movie does have its share of silliness  for example  while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what hes getting  alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head  in an unnecessarily dramatic moment  he apparently is shocked at what he sees  at what he has become  but what has he become  a tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him  doesnt sound too unreasonable to me  considering the genre  but lets face it  any time van damme tries to be dramatic  he looks silly  so maximum risk is a little different from most other action films  while watching it  i was surprised  and a little disappointed  in the relative lack of pyrotechnics  but watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush  after the initial excitement  theres not much left  although its short on spectacle  lams film leaves a better and more lasting impression  i think  im more impressed by it now than i was while watching it  and to me  thats a good sign  go see maximum risk  but dont expect a typical hollywood action movie  expect a sort of funky hong konghollywood action movie  the flying inkpot rating system   wait for the tv2 broadcast     a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha      pretty good  bring a friend       amazing  potent stuff        perfection  see it twice  dr t  white teaches film at the english language and literature department of the national university of singapore  but we dont hold this against him  
1	    warning  the following review contains spoilers    cast  gary sinise  don cheadle  connie nielsen  jerry oconnell  kim delaney  tim robbins  elise neal  jill teed  jody thompson  bill timoney written by  jim thomas  john thomas and graham yost directed by  brian depalma running time  115 minutes the first big event movie of 2000 turns out to be anything but  gary sinise stars as an astronaut who is removed from a mars mission when his astronaut wife  maggie  kim delaney   becomes ill and passes away  don cheadle is then given the mission along with a russian couple and a young hotshot  when a strange whirlwind shot from the top of a mars mountain range attacks the crew of the mission  sinise and robbins convince their superior to let them  neilsen  and oconnell perform a rescue mission for whatever crew might be remaining  what they discover on the surface of the planet will dramatically change their lives forever  although no one watching the film will come away profoundly affected   before i ever saw the film  i was aware of the promotional campaign with dr  pepper  every time i would see a bottle of the soft drink  the mission to mars logo was emblazoned upon it  little did i know that the plot would be taking a back seat to the product placement of the drink and several other products  dr  pepper saves the day at one point  and a dream sequenceflashback features jerry oconnell shoving mms in our face  these are but a couple of the ridiculous examples of product placement scattered throughout the film  clich  s are also the order of the day with mission to mars  dialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style  even independence day  which lifted all of its premises from other scifi films was better than this film  and i dont like independence day   films like 2001  a space odyssey  the abyss  and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from  and poorly at that   there is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon  and i couldnt help but whisper  utinni  to myself and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get a glimpse of it  this film also features one of my alltime least favorite movie clich  s  the  he would have wanted you to have this  moment  where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having  and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on   scenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films  but in a film as clich  ridden as this  it is particularly irritating  ennio morricones music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on  but here it is dreadfully overbearing  his music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes  at other times his music is unbearably overdramatic  one sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue wont reach its intended target  mission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme  events are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen a movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience  we are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife  but i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest  what makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins character needs to turn himself into a popsicle  except to invoke an emotional response  i could think of at least one way to save him  and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be  smarter  than i am   during the finale  when we are finally introduced to the translucent  conehead  kittyfaced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from  we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film  just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn   a brief history lesson about  where we came from  is proffered  then sinise is whisked away to be with  the rest of our people   he does this because his late wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that  this is a chance to step foot where no one else has    from the press ive been seeing this film receive  it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying a quick death at the theater  im sure the first weekend or two will be huge  but once word gets out people will stop going  lets just hope the upcoming red planet is better than this and isnt hurt by the negativity this film is generating  id venture to say it wont be worse than this waste of time  pg 
1	it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a  i  artificial intelligence  just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted to the material  for here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home  an outcast seeking family  themes very familiar from most of spielbergs body of work from sugarland express to close encounters of the third kind to e  t  to empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan  naming just a few examples  a  i  is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies  it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances  the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions  and with the number of births limited by the government  many couples are yearning for children  and professor hobby  william hurt  has the solution  a robotic boy named david  haley joel osment   who is programmed to love  as a test  david is placed with henry swinton  sam robards  and his wife  monica  frances oconnor   their naturalborn son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for his illness  the first third of a  i  deals with davids life with the swintons and how that is changed by the recovery and return of their son  martin  circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons  he is abandoned and alone  david  highly influenced by the fairy tale  pinocchio  feels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monicas love for him  the films second act follows davids search for the blue fairy  whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish  during these adventures he meets and is helped by gigolo joe  jude law   a robot who specializes in sex  spielberg is at his top form in this sequence  offering a brutal  flesh fair  where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers  here  is where kubricks influence is strongly felt  as the movie explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots  the savagery conjures up images from the late directors a clockwork orange  at about two hours and 30 minutes  the film begins to falter during the last 20 minutes  a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters  it is all very anticlimatic and jarring  these scenes seem almost superfluous  as if from a different film  a  i  is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg13 rating  it is a story combining hope and intolerance  sacrifice and bigotry  and while it does not coalesce perfectly  the movie does offer some disturbing images  but a  i  is really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment  if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination  it is this lad  who brings a sense of joy and wonder to the role of david  a being created for the express purpose of loving  he shines when with monica  beaming with love  as eager as a puppy to please  after being left in the woods  he is confused  lost  hurt  focusing on one objective  to become a real boy and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mothers eyes  law is pleasant as the carefree robot who really doesnt understand davids quest  but is nonetheless happy to help him on his journey  probably the toughest role is oconnors monica  playing an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin  she grows conflicted after her boy returns and she begins to perceive david not as a second chance  but as a threat to her family  she gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her course of action  many of a  i  s futuristic sets are breathtaking  especially a mostly submerged new york  lost to the world by the melting of the polar ice caps  a  i  is a flawed film  and you cannot get through the entire feature without pondering  even subconsciously  how it would have turned out with kubrick instead of spielberg behind the camera  would it have been darker  more cynical  we will never know  we can only judge what is before us on the screen  a collaboration of two cinematic giants  a  i  is a most interesting and thoughtprovoking examination of a future that is quickly gaining on us  
0	buffalo  66 is a very rarely known movie that stars vincent gallo and christina ricci  gallo plays a very troubled man  who was sent to jail for gambling  once out of jail  he must visit his parents  who he told he was married  the truth is he isnt married  to try to impress them  he kidnaps a girl  christina ricci  from a tap dancing class to act as his wife  the film is very cheaply made  and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie  but you dont need money to make a good film  buffalo  66 doesnt always stay with the realistic concept  and sometimes goes through outrageous events  gallos parents  played by angelica huston and ben gazarra  are two very strange individuals  the mother plays a football fanatic and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits  gallo and ricci arrive at his parents house  and some extremely funny scenes take place within the house  riccis performance during the scene at gallos parents home are very well done  there is constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes  the way the movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting and creative  they seemed very mediocre  but they worked out just fine  gallos character is developed very well  the impression that he is very depressed and confused is very clear  gallo gives a performance that makes you believe what the character is going through  his character goes through many  many problems  just like many people in real life  this character seemed very realistic to me  riccis character is funny and different  she doesnt care much that she has been kidnaped  in fact  she falls in love the man who kidnaped her  ricci is a very wonderful actress and she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves  buffalo  66 isnt all laughs though  many scenes are very dramatic and depressing  gallos character was so realistic  he was extremely disturbing  some scenes are supposed to come off as funny  but they actually seemed sad and real to life  the film sometimes drags along  not giving much material  i really would have liked to see gallos parents a lot more  and i would have liked to see the characters developed more  overall  buffalo  66 isnt as good as some people put it up to be  the bottom line a few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom  
0	in 1987 the stock market crashed  and oliver stones wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses  wall street lucked out in its timing  the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had  and though its killorbekilled approach to business was exaggerated  that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reaganera businessman  stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs  evil tale relayed in the fastpaced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange  critics and audiences lauded wall street  elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic  im proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them  i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stones output with its thin caricatures  obvious sentiments  and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen  stone goes for broke in every scene  the same could be said for nearly all of his works   this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions  he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane  its all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity  rather than explore what these situations are really like  i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative  as they are presented in boiler room  rather than laughably over the top  these guys are salesmen after all  not televised judges  more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street  the only possible solution i can muster is its release date  and not just the timeliness of the  greed is good  subject matter  the film was plumped down in the eighties  a decade in which the onejoke comedy rose to an art form  and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept  low result movies  in my mind  the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies  but bad music  bad hair  and bad clothes  maybe stones after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace  boiler room is an equally welltimed film with some similarities to stones piece of crap  they both feature a consequential fatherson relationship  though boiler rooms is much more subtle and touching  and they are both concerned with the power of greed  yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slipperysmooth  heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street  boiler room is a message movie as well  though  at least until the end  doesnt shove it in our faces  boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash  as i said  this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day  bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasnt been seen in quite a while   not only do we want to be millionaires  we want to watch other people become millionaires  in our superjudgmental  poweroriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything  when you have money  you have it  all   and seth  giovanni ribisi  wants it  all  the easy way  hes a wellintentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm  the kind that sells junk stock  whereupon he meets others just like him  ben affleck is cast as jim  the company headhunter  who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko  his job is to influence trainees into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood  its ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b  s that theyre told to dish out to prospective buyers  afflecks character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwins similar character in glengary glen ross  and that proves detrimental to the actors performance  affleck shouts  curses and belittles his rookie employees just like baldwin  minus the edge  when alec played the scene he became the part  spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own  by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading  the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks  they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game  rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are  intellectual gangsters  they arent above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes  we drink up this world along with seth  and watch him become seduced by it  just like we might be  as in all cautionary tales  boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing  then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness  i know this story  we all do  but it can work if its told with intelligence and energy  and that is how writer  director ben younger tells it  as a director of  please excuse my french  miseenscene younger has much to learn  his style is sitcom bland  but his writing isnt  youngers script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch  his dialogue is like a junior david mamet  despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phonepitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script  the brokers  hucksters counter every customer objection  gently bullying them into buying stock  these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes  a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isnt aware that he is one  with the exception of afflecks brief appearances  the performances are truly exceptional  ribisi  who has the edgy looks of a character actor  is extremely potent here  working his pale angular face  and eerie  plaintive stare for all their worth  he conveys childlike vulnerability  his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things arent going his way  in some scenes  and in others hes ferociously cut throat  the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie  ribisi is confident when its just him and the phone  but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father  authoritatively played by ron rifkin   boiler room thankfully avoids wall streetlike histrionics in the salespitch sequences  the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys  those ploys are taught to seth by chris  vin diesel   a kind broker who alternates between seths friend and his mentor  diesl shines in his minor role  this week i saw the scifi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner  in that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80s  and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70s  nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he cant have  nia long  as the firms secretary   a lone black women amongst many white men  is ribisis love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets  but develops into something more interesting  the two make an oddly likeable couple  long is smart and brash  and ribisi is charmingly aloof  at one point he says to her  im just lookin for some chocolate love   its a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous childlike way  it becomes sweetly endearing  unfortunately  towards the end  the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy  there is much crying  hugging  and sorrowful stares  this is okay when taken in small doses  but youngers conclusion is constructed as a series of these boohoo moments  one following the other  a particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seths manipulations have on one of his poor victims  its not a bad idea but the execution is lacking  with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message  that message being   greed is bad   yes its patently obvious  but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i havent seen much of in the movies  the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur  and all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners  boiler room offers neither extreme  it gives us what is in between  and for that i am thankful

1	a fullyloaded entertainment review  website coming soon  hunter s  thompsons fear and loathing in las vegas  written in 1971  is already an american classic  not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the postpsychedelia of the 1960s  but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as  gonzo   soon after the book was written  hunter s  thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke  and that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas  the movie   although the book is one of my favorites  i now agree with thompsons own assessment of the novel as  unfilmable   the main problem is that the book  although detailing wild drug use and trippedout adventures  was not written on the road  it was written and edited by hunter s  thomspons  relatively sober  at his home  so although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use  it is told with a sense of aloofness and some humor  hunter s  thomspon  the narrator  while always drugged out  still has a grip on reality  and can still tell  with journalistic ability  what is going on around him  not so with the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas  despite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped  the movie is an exact duplicate of the book  in terms of dialouge  unfortunately  this can get annoying  in the form of johnny depps  who plays thompson  excessive narration  and the characters  while having vivid personalities  are played as 2d characers on the screen  dr  raoul duke  johnny depp  the name raoul duke was an alias of thompsons  and his riding companion  dr  gonzo  benicio del toro   who is a large samoan lawyer  have no personalities or emotions at all  save for stoned  the film is very faithful to the plot  what there is  of the book  in that dr  raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint 400  and takes along not only his samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs  from there  one set of stoned adventures after another happens  including one of the few good scenes in which depp  high on acid  watches all the people in the bar around him turn into  literally  lounge lizards  while the movie has its moments  few   it is almost unwatchable at parts  especially towards the end  despite a lot of celebrity cameos  the stars never get off the ground  the set decoration and costumes are great  and probably deserve an oscar nomination  however  as we all know  its not sets or effects that make a movie  its the characters  and quite frankly  these characters are no good  
1	i guess there are those who have never been kissed before  a rare and dying breed   except if youre child  in which case it would be called experimenting  rarer still are those who have never been kissed before they reach the twenties  hardest to believe still  is that drew barrymore has never been kissed  despite all these hard to believe tit bits  there are people out there who have never truly been kissed  and who are still waiting for that right person to give them the wet  sloppy warm feeling of tongues intermingling  reassuring them that their search for true love is over  well  this movie is about a girl waiting for the right boy to give her the kiss of her life  and its sweet  drew barrymore who shone in  ever after is wonderful as  josie  grossy  the high school dweeb who becase a professional editor  before being assigned by her paper to return to school as an undercover reporter  it addresses the issues of how a dweeb  becomes a prom queen and finds the man of her life all in one sitting  hard to believe  but possible  there may also be those who have been kissed before  but in fact  never truly been given the kiss  so this movie can be watched by those who are waiting for true love or those who are still searching for it  either way  it is one enjoyable sit  with a fairytale ending  
1	postchasing amy  a slew of lovetriangle movies  this month we have kissing a fool  costarring amys own lee  and april brings us the object of my affection  which may as well be titled chasing allan  for it is the story of a woman who falls in love with her gay roommate    to be absolutely six degrees of kevin bacon about it  that film stars schwimmers friend jennifer aniston   if only kevin smith could write them all    schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max  who falls in love with his best friend jay  lee  s book editor samantha  avital  a mere twentyfour hours after meeting her  they are soon engaged  and max  because of his own raging libido  grows suspicious of samanthas fidelity  he convinces jay to flirt with samantha during the development of his book  to  test her   the trouble is  jay might be secretly in love with her  to stretch this flat  sitcom premise to feature length  the plot is framed by a climactic wedding  at which bonnie hunt recounts the triangular talethe events leading up to the nuptialsto an annoying fat man and his silly girlfriend  hunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film  schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly humorous dialogue  and lee  poor lee  is miscast  so hysterically funny in chasing amy  here he is forced to repress his comic instincts  to swear  to yell  to talk about oral sex    the scripts idea of a character trait is to stress that jay is a  sensitive man   and then show him drinking pepto bismol when hes stewing over his girl trouble  as for avital  an israeli actress  she is warm and sweet  but we dont know anything about her character other than that it takes her an incredibly long time to realize the most obvious things  she also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer  who plays schwimmers assistant and personal temptress  turning that particular subplot into an unintentional riff on vertigo  there are a handful  a smattering  of good scenes in kissing a fool  i enjoyed a moment in a comedy club  during which jay gets up and asks  has anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much you wanted to kill her   over and over until hes booted off stage  there are also a few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything thats on the page  kissing a fool is never as clever as the thursday night jokemachine friends that spawned schwimmers movie career  so save yourself eight dollars and watch three episodes of that series back to back  
0	in this years summer movie preview issue of entertainmentweekly  theresa connelly described her writingdirecting debut  polishwedding  as  a child that did not quite become the child i thought it would   one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film  a comedydrama that appears doomed at its most basic elements  the family at the center of polishwedding is the pzoniaks  which consists of mother jadzia  lena olin   father bolek  gabriel byrne   sole daughter hala  claire danes  and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness  its a large family  but theres not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch  certainly not in the primary trio  jadzia takes pride in building and maintaining a home and family  but shes kind of a hypocrite since shes carrying on an affair with a businessman rade serbedzija   her excuse for her affair is neglect from bolek  who is such a passive wimp that one cannot connect with his sadness and frustration  also  how could he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy  sexy jadzia  hala is a spoiled  selfcentered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy  with such an unappealing set of characters  its no surprise that polishweddings plot complications are far from involving  naturally  jadzia and bolek would like hala to marry the young cop  russell schuster  adam trese   who fathered the child  but he refuses to make such a commitment  hohum  another complication  involving the decidedly unvirginal hala being selected to crown a statue of the virgin mary  is first played for laughs and then  inexplicably  as a profound statement in the films climaxwhich  ironically  is funnier than any of the films lame attempts at humor  such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in a charge to beat up russell  that scene is but one in a number of writing miscues by connelly  the jadziabolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to sitcom viewers  the halarussell conflict isnt resolved in as contrived a manner  but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they had missed something  and then theres some atrocious dialogue  which i am sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound   look at all these pickles  just looking at them gives me such great sadness   as misguided as polishwedding is  the affair is something of a letdown  considering the strong performances by byrne  danes  and especially the fiery olin  they obviously believed in connelly and her materiala faith that audiences will be hardpressed to share  
0	capsule  sidesplitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through to the end    but not without providing a good deal of genuine laughs  most comedies these days have one flaw  theyre not funny  they think theyre funny  but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly  occasionally a good funny movie sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor and we get a real gem  ruthless people  for instance  which established a microcosm of a setup and played it out to the bitter end  liar liar is built the same way and is just about as funny  this is one of the few movies ive seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through  instead of a couple of setpieces that inspired a laugh  think of the dismal fatal instinct   the whole movie works like clockwork  jim carrey playes a highpowered lawyer  to whom lying is as natural as breathing  there is one thing he takes seriously  though  his son  and we can sense the affection that they have for each other right away  but his wife is divorced and seeing another man  and now it looks like they may move away together  the son goes with them  of course  the movie sets up this early material with good timing and a remarkable balance of jim carreys overthetop persona with reality  then the plot springs into action  after being snubbed  not deliberately  by his father at his birthday  the kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday candles  that for just one day  dad cant lie  he gets the wish  what happens next is sidesplitting  everything turns into a confrontation  when cornered by a bum for some change  he shouts   no  im not giving you any money because i know youll spend it on booze  all i want to do is to get to the office without having to step over the debris of our decaying society   he cant even get into an elevator without earning a black eye  and whats worse  hes now gotten himself into an expensive divorce settlement that requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture  carrey  who i used to find unfunny  has gotten better at his schtick  even if its a limited one  he uses it to great effect in this movie  there is a scene where he tries to test his ability to lie and nearly demolishes his office in the process  theres a grin breaking out across my face right now  just remembering the scene   he cant even write the lie  his fingers twitch  his body buckles like someone in the throes of cyanide poisoning  and when he tries to talk its like hes speaking in tongues  equally funny is a scene where he beats himself to a pulp  dont ask why   tries to drink water to keep from having outbursts in the courtroom  it fails  with semipredictable results   and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom to have everyone ask what they think of them  this scene alone may force people to stop the tape for minutes on end  the movie sustains its laughs and also its flashes of insight until almost the end  a shame  too  because the movie insists on having a big  ridiculous climax that involves carreys character flagging down a plane using a set of motorized stairs  then breaking his leg  etc  a simple reconciliation would do the trick  why is this stupid pentup climax always obligatory  its not even part of the movies real agenda  thankfully  liar liar survives it  and so does carrey  maybe they were being merciful  on reflection  if id laughed any more  i might have needed an iron lung  
1	the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic  finding an allstar cast for such a film is a stroke of genius  combining all that with a threetime oscarwinning director  robert benton of  kramer vs  kramer   and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment  in yet another noir mystery set in hollywood  how many of these have we seen during the past few years   the atmosphere is moody  the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere  over70 harry ross  paul newman  is a washed up copturnedprivate eyeturned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life  hes screwed up things pretty well   i had a wife and daughter  now  im a drunk  and is at a crossroads  a couple of years ago  he traveled to mexico to bring back mel  reese witherspoon   the underage daughter of jack  gene hackman  and catherine  susan sarandon  ames and now lives with them  the ames are former movie stars  past their prime and the three have become fast friends  one gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up  to fill his time  he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine  jack is in even worse shape than harry  hes dying of cancer with only a year to live  things do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him  instead of the routine errand that ross expects  he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another excop who is  himself  full of bloody holes  this unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherines first husband 20 years before  through a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder  blackmail  guns  mels mexico traveling partner and his parole officer  rosss former cop buddies  exlover and wouldbe sidekick  the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to  its a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale  but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about  the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario  by the time they show you  it doesnt matter  the storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in rosss relationship with rubin  giancarlo esposito   a partner wannabe  these scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief  however they are neither  rubin and ross have some past relationship but either its not explained or i didnt care enough at that point to remember  a running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform  its also not funny  doesnt connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course  on the positive side  its often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen  the three leads all have welldeserved academy awards and turn in accomplished  if not extraordinary jobs  newman is a grand actor  but doesnt seem quite suited to the dark film style  he is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out  hackman  also lowkey  is believable but lacks sparkle  sarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is onedimensional  the actors do what they can with lame dialog  but they cant pull the film out of the hole its dug for itself  james garner who plays rosss old buddy excop raymond hope is always a treat  but even he halfheartedly struggles through lines like  im glad they didnt shoot your pecker off   the best part of the film is the look at old friends  how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make  the genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen the film doesnt run very long before the audience realizes that its hopeless  the only reason for watching is the actors  it reminds me of disaster movies such as  towering inferno  where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the films problems  in a better world  there would have been secondrate actors in this secondrate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better  of course  we dont live in that better world  but you could make yours a little nicer by choosing a different movie

0	truman   trueman   burbank is the perfect name for jim carreys character in this film  president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide  in spite of  or was it because of  his stature    truman  also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war  an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans  and burbank  california  brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc  if hollywood is the center of the film world  burbank is  or was  the center of tvs world  the world where our protagonist lives  combine all these names and concepts into  truman burbank   and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world  truman leads the perfect life  his town  his car  and his wife are picture perfect  his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky  the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart      but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light  the next day during the drive to work  the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements  he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian  when the radio comes back to normal  the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully  his suspicion aroused  he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities  the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator  the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks  a grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door  made to look like the back of an elevator  into place  two security guards grab him and throw him out  truman is really suspicious now  it gets even worse the next day when his wife  a nurse  describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge    its best not to think about it   she says  trying vainly to change trumans memory  truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense  at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town  his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world  you know by now that trumans life is the subject of a television program  his actions are  real  but everything else is carefully scripted  from the death of his father to the choice of his wife  truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is  meanwhile  christof  the allseeing creator of trumans world does his best to keep him unaware and happy  its sort of like westworld told from the robots point of view  or jurassic park from the dinosaurs point of view  we root for the captive of the cageworld  our protagonist is counting on  chaos theory  to help him escape his elaborate trap  the story  written by andrew niccol  writerdirector of gattaca   introduces some interesting questions  such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life  or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake  although these questions came to mind  i dont think the film itself asked them  it certainly didnt address them or try to answer them  i was particularly disappointed that the film didnt deal more with the trauma of learning ones life is a tv show  carreys performance at the end showed a smidgen of trumans pain  but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the films pacing  earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well  the two seemed exclusive of one another  but weir and niccol didnt see it that way  perhaps its not fair to criticize a movie for what it isnt  but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here  but on its own terms  the movie is well made  sight  sound and pacing are all handled competently  much of the first part of the movie is the truman show  the scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras  with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen  one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio  the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen  the music is wellchosen and scored  the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music  when trumans world is still beautiful and perfect  when the movie ends  the score sounds more like a frantic  driven  tangerine dream opus  while still keeping the same timbre  philip glass epic music  from powaqqatsi  permeates trumans scenes of suspicion and awakening    glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show   and the pacing of the story was brisk  there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show  just a few quick title cards  a few interviews  and then right into the show  and the movie  one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling  there was no token scene of trumans idyllic life before it falls apart  because it wasnt necessary  we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble  and no sooner  theres also no point in the movie where the plot slows down  its a quick  straight shot to the movies end  in terms of overall quality  i would compare the truman show to niccols gattaca  both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds  but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas  neither film  clicked  and became an instant classic  nevertheless  i look forward to niccols next film  whatever it may be  
1	kirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue  all he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow  and you instantly know what hes thinking    detective story  features one of kirk douglass finest performances  he stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night  the film is based on a play  and this is quite evident  as most of the movie takes place in the oneroom flat that the detectives work in  the film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife  but through a series of events  he never quite makes it there  the bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider  a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate  however  this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglass wife  a connection douglas himself is not aware of  many secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film  secrets i would not dream of giving away  with a name like  detective story   one would assume the film would resemble an episode of  nypd blue   but it doesnt quite work out that way  however  we do see douglas at work on a few other cases throughout the running time  lee grant  virtually unrecognizable  plays a meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting  her scenes with bendix  another detective  provide the movie with a few laughs  the performances all around are fantastic  douglas may be the leader of this ensemble  but hes not the center of attention all the time  we get to catch a glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases  which brings me back to douglas  he has a really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him  we can see that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime  but has finally realized that what hes really done is gotten back at his criminal father  how he handles coming to terms with this is something really worth seeing  kirk douglas is the kind of actor we dont seem to see to much of these days  hes a tough guy  but the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior  
1	meet joe black is your classic boymeetsgirl  boylikesgirl  boygetskilledinhorribleaccident  supernaturalentitytakesoverboysbody  supernaturalentityfallsinlovewithgirl story  based on the 1934 film death takes a holiday  meet joe black is a well acted romantic drama which explores the meanings of life and love  william parrish  anthony hopkins  is a billionaire businessman on the brink of his 65th birthday  he has built a huge media empire  and raised two beautiful daughters  allison  marcia gay harden  and susan  claire forlani   william has been able to negotiate his way out of many tough spots    but he has suddenly begun fearing his own mortality  the one situation he wont be able to talk his way out of  and he has good reason to fear  for death himself is stalking him  however  death has a deal to make  death has taken possession of a man who has recently died  brad pitt   and wants william to be his guide in a holiday among the living  in return  william gets to live a few extra days  of course  he agrees  death  under the human name of  joe black   gets to experience life as a complete innocent  he never before has experienced the simple pleasures of a springy matters or peanut butter  and hes not quite compared for the more complex pleasures when he and susan fall in love  but  is their affair doomed to an early demise  at nearly three hours in length  meet joe black is a little bit on the leisurely side  though it never gets boringly lengthy  instead  the film gets a chance to develop some nicely textured characters and situations  you get to soak in and enjoy the atmosphere  rather than being hurriedly rushed through it  the romantic angle works well  though  surprisingly  the interactions between joe black and william parrish are more interesting than those with his daughter  this is most likely due to anthony hopkins  who once again displays his superb acting skills  william is a desperate man who has had a seemingly ideal life  and doesnt want to let it go  by contrast  claire forlani is merely the romantic interest  she gets to show joe the ropes of love  but is hardly as interesting a character  as joe black  brad pitt seems a bit stilted  granted  hes supposed to be outofplace  but the overly formal technique used by pitt begins to distract from the role  still  he is able to hold his own  and over the course of the three hours  his character begins to grow on you  the main character who seems out of place here is drew  jake weber   an ambitious executive in williams company who is joe blacks main rival for susans affections  weber plays the character with a hammy relish reminiscent of snidley whiplash  this cartoonish foil an aberration in a film filled many more dimensional characters  the supernatural elements of the film are handled murkily  but never distractingly so  we never learn what is the exact nature of death  or why hes never done something like this before  it actually gets a bit creepy when death talks to the dying in their own voicesaccents    his initial conversations with hopkins sound shockingly like hannibal lecter     and the ultimate resolution to one of the films supernatural problems seems  well  somewhat superficial  still  even with the films length  it was a pleasant time at the movies  something you wouldnt necessarily expect from a film about death    but one which meet joe black delivers anyhow

1	a few months before the release of star wars episode 1  the phantom menace  20th century fox decides to release another space film  that is a complete rip off of star wars  what is the point of this  i do not know  but i wish it hadnt been done  considering wing commander is definitely the years worst film so far  to attract people to this horrible movie  they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace  wing commander will draw large crowds  because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time  the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight  many people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game  i found this very interesting  considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie  it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though  freddie prinze jr  stars in the film as christopher blair  wing commander was a huge mistake for freddie  this was definitely his worst performance to date  after januarys shes all that  i actually saw a good actor in freddie  but now all those visions have been crushed    for now anyway   christopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi  a group that is trying to destroy the earth  blairs parents also fought in the space battles  and also died there  his parents were pilgrims  so many people disrespect him because of this  blair is under the command of  angel   played by saffron burrows  and he is friends with another pilot  todd  maniac marshall   played by matthew lillard  matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie  and he does in this one too  his character as stu in 1996s scream  a   was a great one  but now  it seems like that same role is being played again  only in a space movie  the three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth  this plot is very flimsy  and doesnt give a whole lot to work with at all  this explains why wing commander drags on  seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on  the acting is horrible in wing commander  many lines seem out of place  and are completely meaningless  the acting and dialogue was so terrible  i even found myself laughing at it  the other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music  the special effects are very unrealistic  when looking at two ships flying side by side  it is simple to tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them  the explosions look very unrealistic as well  a ship will be blown up  but there will only be fire present four about one half of a second  this is very unrealistic  music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time  the music also felt like video game music  and it was very corny and annoying sounding  after we are given the plot  the film repeats itself for another hour  without any plot twists  interesting scenes  or anything important to the film  blair is forced to make jumps over other planets  and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft  for the entire length of the movie  it takes place in space  it is truly like you are in a video game  because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long  extended period of time  its not much fun to watch at all  if i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships  i would go watch star wars at home  at least star wars pays attention to people  myth  feelings  and has some real plot to it  the bottom line bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox  
1	its time to take cover  after a hiatus of about fifteen years  the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest  in early 1997  there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone  one on television and two in the theaters  with dantes peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar  of the two  i had heard that dantes peak was the better film  so i decided to check it out when it was released on video  the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town  the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption  flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky  crushing homes and people  we see people panicking  people crying  and even horses rearing  it is a disaster of biblical proportions  signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road  symbolism doesnt get much more blatant than that  we learn that harry dalton  pierce brosnan   a volcanologist with the u  s  geological survey  was there with his wife when the eruption occurred  harry survived  but his wife did not  a few years later  harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dantes peak  washington  which  we are told  has been voted second most desirable place to live  under 20  000  by the readers of money magazine   there harry meets rachel wando  a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dantes peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop  although the mayor doesnt seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up  a few members of the city council are  they are afraid that harrys presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dantes peak  they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug  however  when an amorous young couple takes a skinnydip in the local hot springs  they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath  thus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption  this film contains a number of cliches  the amorous couple is one  as soon as they doff their clothes  you know theyre going to die  the town busybody and the abrasive motherinlaw make appearances  as does the deathdefying dog  countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable  watching the movie  i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements  but some of the dialogue as well  unfortunate  since much of the dialog is terrible  for example  harrys boss  paul  charles hallahan   and a team from the u  s  geological survey join harry to assess the situation  paul basically tells the townsfolk that harrys eruption predictions arent cause for alarm  this causes harry to leave in a fit of rage  only to turn up the next day  ready for work  when paul asks harry why he stayed  he says with grim determination   cause this towns in trouble and im the best man youve got   even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving  he likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water  if the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up  however  the frog wont move and will allow itself to be cooked    is that your recipe for frog soup   asks one of the team members    its my recipe for disaster   responds harry  dantes peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious  our heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid  mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming  in a very grave tone   acid eats metal   thanks for the tip  when we first see the u  s  geological survey building  theres a caption labeling it as such  this wouldnt have been so bad if it werent for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads  in large letters   u  s  geological survey   i suppose the caption is for people who cant read signs  although harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film  the viewer has no idea why  there is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters  and the relationship seems rushed because of this  when they get close to kissing  i was asking myself   why do they want to kiss  were they even attracted to each other   if i were the mayor  i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesnt even crack a smile through the whole movie  trying to pull off the roughyetdebonair act  who does he think he is  james bond  the eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed  there are several  warning signs  prior to the eruption itself  but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we dont feel as if they are leading up to anything  for example  one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot  a tremor occurs  does he plunge headlong to his death  is he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below  no  a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg  the sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene  which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well  it wasnt  one plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dantes peak  in a disaster movie  theres usually one guy whos greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruptionfireearthquakeexplosiontsunamitornadometeorite  and usually gets killed by the disaster  its okay  of course  because we all think he got what he deserved  if youre going to be unoriginal  you might as well go all the way  in dantes peak  the city councilmembers are concerned  but they dont really try hard enough  maybe the mayors abrasive motherinlaw should have been the one  for no apparent reason  she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt  perhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate  there are a couple of good things about this movie  the first is the scenery  there are panoramic shots of forests  lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful  the second is the special effects  they are the closest ive ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption  but when elements which dont speak are going to be the best parts of your movie  youd probably better rewrite the script

1	in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies  payback was better than conspiracy theory  but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon  in other words  its a decent couple of hours of entertainment  but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibsons greatest hits  payback probably wont be on it  gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll  mels partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt  so he puts a couple of bullets in mel  leaving him for dead  and goes on to pay off his creditors  but  mel isnt dead  it would be a real short movie if he was  and he certainly isnt happy  to make matters worse  he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat  his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters  so mel goes after the mob to get it back  payback is often a very violent film  to its credit  there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic  but the director  im not sure which one  more about that in a second  made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films  the film appears a bit disjointed in places  which is understandable considering producer  star gibson wasnt thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it reshot  when the director refused  another one was brought in to do the reshoot  so as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original  although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake  it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end  its always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain  unless that person has some redeeming qualities  in this case  gibsons character has few redeeming qualities  but hey  its mel  so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him  my guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role  the audience would not be quite as responsive  gibson is gibson  whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer  he does a good job  he almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance  this time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast  including maria bello  as his love interest   william devane and kris kristofferson  as mod bosses   the man who steals the show and unfortunately doesnt have a real big part is james coburn  as yet another mobster   if i had one big disappointment in this film  it would be that coburn didnt have a bigger role  in the end  payback is a fairly solid action thriller  just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibsons other work

0	oliver stones latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents  its a threehour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century  stone doesnt hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house  the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done  at the same time he creates a very human character  a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics  which is here pictured as a wild animal  he is simply trying to tame it  but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the presidents ability to control them  stone doesnt in any way apologize for nixon  he blames not only nixons own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself  the system that  once set in motion  behaves with a mindlessness of its own    nixon  is a modern shakespeare story  a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws  theres something almost majestic about the process  as nixon goes down in this film  there is no gloating  but a watery sigh  as of a great ship sinking  sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding  creating a very emotional picture of the 37th american president  joan allens magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette  she is strong and loyal as mrs  nixon  the rest of the cast is equally magnificent  including  james woods  j  t  walsh  paul sorvino  ed harris and bob hoskins  everyone does a serious and demanding job  no one are disappointing  stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy  honest and determined  he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element  at times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixons youth and childhood  the flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin  robert richardsons rich cinematography and john williams musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere  the films only fault is that its a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers  still its an honest and captivating  a solid piece of movie making  
1	the happy bastards quick movie review the concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid  really  shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control  sadly  that is the case with kingpin  a film directed by the farrelly brothers  the duo that brought us theres something about mary and dumb and dumber  since the duo directed and didnt write the script  i can assume thats part of the problem  the story seems good enough  a pro bowler in the 1970s by the name of roy munson  woody harrelson  is sitting on top of the world  his popularity has gone through the roof and hes getting his career off the ground  then  however  he runs into ed mccracken  bill murray   a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for  well  anything  these two form an illtimed relationship that involves risky betting  and  before roy sees it coming  eds abandoned him and hes about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine  forward seventeen years later  where roy has become quite the loser  complete with mechanical hand  tornup car  and  of course  the occasional knocking up of the uglyass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while  however  he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley  where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael  randy quaid   who has quite the bowling arm  with the kids help  he figures he can be known again  particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno  nevada  of course  the amish kid needs some coaxing  particularly when you consider  well  hes amish  this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film  such as roys process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow  finally  the duo get on the road and  along the way  pick up an additional helper a beautiful hustler  played by the gorgeous vanessa angel   the main problem i had with kingpin wasnt the fact it wasnt funny  in fact  it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it  such as the aformentioned above and roys explanation of not having children  something involving a cheese grater    but thats just it scenes  theres a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie  like the abuse angel takes from her hustler exboyfriend  i mean  was this really necessary  couldnt have this been handled just a bit wackier  i mean  this is a comedy  why throw ethics in  particularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle  where hair gel can be easily mistaken  that really ruined it  however  and thats too bad  the acting is top notch  especially from angel and murray  and the really funny scenes are worth noting  still  if youre going to think dumb  think dumb all the way through  ok  at least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or id still be a little bit irked  
0	battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000  and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close  in fact  ill be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years  based on the novel by scientology guru l  ron hubbard  battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information  its the year 3000  and an alien race called the psychlos  which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers  conquered our planet in nine minutes  ok  we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind  when were we conquered  the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1  000 years earlier  and if that is the case then were going to get into a whole bunch of problems later  trust me    keep reading   also  why dont we get to see earth get conquered  how the hell do you make a popcorn scifi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film  humans now live as cavemen or slave labor  and for the films first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver  colorado  they grunt and groan and babble about monsters  so  when the psychlos conquered earth  were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills  none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered  whenever that was   this is definitely not the way to start an actionscifi film  one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster  and he begins to fight it  the  monster  turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course  he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course  with some shrubs growing over them  so  in 1  000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time  with only a few weeds growing over it  anyway  some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl  john travolta  a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit  the cavemen  led by barry pepper  are forced to do their bidding or whatever  but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet  or something  so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1  000 years earlier  and  were supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who cant even handle a few cavemen  one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos  so jets left unattended for 1  000 years are still able to fly  please  if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood  why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway  shouldnt they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us  the psychlos refer to humans as  man animals  but yet dogs are still  dogs   why arent they  dog animals   the psychlos are after mining earths precious resources  but for 1  000 years are unaware of fort knox  why do i even care at this point  im a fan of travoltas and im glad to see hes back on the alist in hollywood  despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon   but how did he possibly think this was a good movie  and how did he think he was giving a good performance here  hes more than capable of making a menacing villain  see broken arrow and faceoff  but whenever his character came on screen i couldnt hold back my laughter  now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have  travolta just looks like travolta  all of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face  but travolta just has a goatee  also  travoltas acts with a sort of phony upperclass snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world  ooooo  scary villain  as a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better  you can make a dumb but good scifi film  i love independence day for example   but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth  i did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening    i cleaned my glasses  walked around the theater  made a grocery list  chose my lottery numbers for the week  replayed super bowl xxv in my head  with commercials     and still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids  by the time we actually reach the year 3000  people should still be avoiding this film  folks  save your cash   dont go see it  dont rent it  and dont buy it  youd be more entertained by taking the money youd use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind  watching it sail away  hell  send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal    well entertain you plenty with that kind of money   unless of course youre just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running  which is just about all youll come away with from this movie  that  and a headache  editors note  for some reason though  the day after my screening i converted to scientology  im not sure why    something just made me feel compelled make the choice

0	if i were to plot a graph of year against movieplotridiculity for  hollywood movies  youll probably see a line with constant gradient   now  if i were to plot that same graph for the movies that the michael  bayjerry bruckheimer has made over the last 4 years  that line would be  exponential in growth  the team started out with the will smith vehicle  bad boys which was no more than a 2hr long actionmusicvideo   nevertheless entertaining  then came the rock  where audiences flocked  to see nicholas cage team up with sean connery against some terrorizing  general fighting over some stupid cause  conair was ridiculousy dumb in  its premise but it did have fun moments  and who can forget the nursery  rhyme sang by that psycho killer played by steve buscemi  while these  movies worked because there was something better to coverup the dirt   armageddon does not  very much like deep impact  a meteor is heading towards earth and they  didnt realize it until 18 days from impact  deep impact settled with  the modest meteor size as large as the city of new york but armageddon  just had to be bigger     well about the size of texas  that kinda meteor  whould probably knock earth out of its orbit    the panic of this  sighting spurs the idea of landing people on the meteor  drill it then  nuke it  sounds familiar  and who better to do such a job than harry  stamper  bruce willis   your very own oildriller extraordinaire and  his team of machomisfits  nursing the tagline there aint nothin on  this planet that harry cant drill    in that 18 days  harrys group was  split into 2 teams  trained for deepspace flight and finally blasted  into space in with special drilling vehicles on 2 new space shuttles  the main relationship drama of armageddon is formed within the  relationship of harry  a  j  and grace  to give you an idea  a  j  works  for harry  and loves grace  harrys daughter  the problem is  harry  hates to see his daughter hanging around some scruffy grunt like himself  for the rest of her life  so while a  j  and harry struts it out  grace  is place in a position where she is unable to take sides  so she remains  seated in the nasa control tower  crying over both of them in about 80  of the movie  the human elements this movie tries to inject proves to be nothing more  than just an excuse for more slowmos and goldtinted photography  the  anguish of the world is potrayed with scenes of people praying  running  for their lives or just sitting still staring at the sky  sounds fine  right  i know  but it looks too out of place on screen  too staged  if  you were to ask yourself  whats the difference between armageddon and  a rb music video   youd probably just said the music    not  surprising since michael bay is a child of that industry and has  actually managed to transpose his mtv skills to screen successfully  his  foray into armageddon just proves that he doesnt when to stop  well theres really nothing much to sum up here  the  stockaitkenwaterman of hollywood movies have projected their artform  into ridiculity  beyond the plane believability  where people still  accept even if they didnt believe  deep impact was ridiculous in most  aspects and i believe the makers know this  the thing is  they decided  to shroud myth and fantasy with a purely believable human tale of  suffering and coming in terms with ones problems  which ultimately  brought it above the ashes which it had initially put itself in   armageddon  is an overcrowded  loud  messy  preposterously manipulative  waste of money and deserves to remain in that same pile of ash   20 if you have planned to watched this over deep impact because of liv  tyler  bruce willis or the tagline  from the makers of the rock      please catch deep impact before it finishes its run  it may be the only  meteor worth watching in longlong time  if you have to see it  please  bring earplugs and some aspirins  for the vertigo   expect armageddon  lds to retail at s19  90 at carrefour come release time  gee       even  thats not worth it  
0	i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the xfiles  first  let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie  the producers are not stupid  making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable  you have to reach for a larger audience  therefore  the movie is quite userfriendly  altough  nonfans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange  but fear not  duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on  you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera  in any case  the answer is no  i am not a fan of the xfiles  i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium  however  since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movies opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie  i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie  i am glad to report that i learned nothing new  everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others  i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie  warning  major spoilers follow  please do not read to fully enjoy this movie  you must not be able know what is coming  what exactly is over that hill and what that weird  hummm  sound is all about  you have been warned  the xfiles is what a summer should be  exciting  scary  great special effects  unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary  and good performances  this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank  from start to finish  this movie does not let go of you  when i compare it with last summers movies the best way to describe it would be  take the excitement and great score from faceoff and the deadly use of sound from event horizon  this flick is scary  not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes  in fact  the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue  you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd  the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid  you know  when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair  or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt  so yeah  the xfiles is scary  and guess what  you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed  computer generated  babyzilla  it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster  do not think that the xfiles is a monster movie  in fact  the creature is there for maybe three minutes total  no  the xfiles is definately a mulder episode of the series  scully is at his side  of course  but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time  she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny  but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much  no  this is mulders time in the spotlight  by now  you have heard of the scene where mulder  showers  independence day  if you have not then i will not spoil it for you  lets just say that due to recent events mulder should be  showering  godzilla instead  to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there    who cares   if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about  the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous  the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill  the script is spotless  every thing that happens happens for a purpose  if you are confused by something  do not worry because it will all become clear later on but  and i cannot stress this enough  pay attention    unlike most summer movies  the dialogue is twice as important as the effects  miss one vital piece of information and  like most people who talk during movies  you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense  also  to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies    dont  the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation  there is no time to take a breather between scenes because  again unlike most summer movies  godzilla anybody    the xfiles does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots  every scene is crucial and serves a purpose  who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a  big emotional scene  between godzilla attacks  so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies id recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose  but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie  the xfiles is  what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited  cool effects  its got some  pulse pounding  hell yes  strangely enough  i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while nonfans will have a good time  it does not provide answers to the shows many questions  the status quo remains nearly the same and  no  mulder and scully do not get together  rating  four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer  several jump right out of your seat thrills  many  whoah  i never saw that one coming   moments  four  holy shit  where the hell did that come from  and one heck of an ending  you may wonder where this movie lost half a star  well  i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck  the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop  its pretty obvious the films makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that

1	an entertaining 2 hours awaits the audience in this film set in the early 80s  sevigny and beckinsale play disco chicks alice and charlotte  who are on the lookout for love  alice is mousy  shy  intellectual  charlotte is bitchy  outgoing and fun  we join their adventures as they go through a variety of adventures  and men  all to the background of the local disco  whit stillman has both written and directed an interesting and believable story  alice and charlotte are both well written characters  and the actresses who play them arent bad aswell  sevigny delivers an honest performance  and makes the audience feel for her character  beckinsale plays extreme bitch personified  yet her character never becomes completely unlikeable  the huge supporting cast also play a part in making sure this movie is thoroughly entertaining  the dialogue is sharp and well written  with many funny set pieces  for example  theres a great discussion about lady  the tramp by the main characters  the disco tunes playing in the background also make sure that this admittedly long film is good fun  the direction is good  bringing out the drama and comedy in the scenes  but their are slight flaws with the movie  firstly  although it is supposedly set in the 80s  the characters are very  very 90s  the way they dress and act have a very 90s feel to them  although the male hairstyles look slightly 80s  frankly the 80s atmosphere just wasnt conveyed  which is a shame  also  as mentioned above  the film is too long  and some parts do lag  the charm of the characters do help these moments  but generally the editing could of been a bit tighter  the plot also sidetracks into a silly cocaine dealing bust  which seemed out of place in this movie  finally  their are almost too many characters in the film  and despite the running time  the film never really spends enough time on them  some of the characters are very slight  which is a shame  the conclusion  while funny  is also surprisingly weak  and certainly not strong enough  but despite these qualms  the last days of disco is a funny  warm movie  which is certainly worth seeing  and is a fitting homage to the disco era of the 80s  worth a look  overall rating review by david wilcock  1998   you know  for kids   norville barnes 
1	to put it bluntly  ed wood would have been proud of this  a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor  hokey drama  zero logic and a crap screenplay  also  a beautifully anticlimactic ending  not to say it didnt look intriguing when i saw the previews  so much for truth in advertising  roland emmerich  whos later  independence day  would look like  the 400 blows  compared to this  cowrited and directed this inane scifi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens  in a useless opening sequence  men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it  it wouldnt be till present day  94  till they would actually figure it out  theyre decipherer  a slightlyneurotic scientist  nice twist   dr  dan jackson  james spader  doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare  whos life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word  why do they use him to decipher what no one else could  so there is a hokey ending  duh  he figures it out in about a minute  yea  and then they get a suicidal colonel or something   jack  oneill  kurt russel  with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flattop that would make howie long snap into a fetal position   why a suicidal colonel  for the ending  youll get the hang of this  they open the stargate  a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad  after an overdone special effects thing  theyre    inside a goddam pyramid  so they went to egypt  right  wrong  theyre on another planet that was filmed in egypt  they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra  the sun god  the androginous jaye davidson  with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma   and there are fights  explosions and a kiss between two people  yea  also melodrama  stupidity  hokey scenes and a bizarre language  an anticlimactic ending ends with stupid lines   say hello to king tut  asswhole    the quintessential line  lemme tell ya  and some convenient pesudopseudopseudocharacter development  by the end  you just wanna go home and watch  i dont know  the  outer limits  or something  the scripts terrible  the special effects are okay  but nothing great  the storys so weak that its almost opaque  the whole experience just isnt worth it unless youre so bored that youd consider watching a  full house  marathon    or this  id pick this  obviously  but still  its just not fun at all  and i cant wait for it to premier on mst3k  
0	with many bigbudget science fiction films  great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts  cheesy plot twists  and  terrible acting  the fifth element  the abyss  and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting  writing  or both  at first glance  the matrix  larry  andy wachowskis scifikungfushootemup spectacular  looks like a prime candidate to join the list of highconcept bad movies  especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role  but despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue  the matrix works  its an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films  most obviously the terminator films  star wars  and total recall   but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout  reeves plays neo  a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with  trinity   carrieanne moss   a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks  a unseen  omniscient cult figure known as  morpheus   lawrence fishburne   and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell  neo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems  moreover  he discovers that the grim  bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it  neo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah  with grave doubts that he is actually  the one  prophesized to come and save the world  reluctant or not  what follows is a mix of hong kongstyle slowmotion shootouts  surreal dream sequences  high speed chases  and comic book kungfu fights  the film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality  how exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind  and if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in  would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion  unfortunately  the matrix doesnt provide many answers to the questions it raises  but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions  shootouts  and flying roundhouse kicks  perhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving  who plays agent smith  the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix  weavings stony appearance  deadpan voice  and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting  evil technological force that controls the matrix  like robert patrick as the shapeshifting t1000 terminator in terminator 2  judgement day  weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because  despite his power and seeming invincibility  he looks ordinary  even scrawny  weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence  the film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography  it seems to be deliberately kitchy  with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors  in a few scenes  the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny  just seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring  however  with the comicbook style and tone of the film  you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience  the matrix isnt a classic  its openended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers  it fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions  it also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero  the kind of shmaltzy feelgood goo that most of the film avoids  reportedly  the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel  unfortunately  audiences deserve a little more than a vague sense that the story will continue in the future  the matrix is an fun  enjoyable diversion  like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival  just dont be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry

0	seen at  amc old pasadena 8  pasadena  ca  in sdds  paul verhoevens last movie  showgirls  had a bad script  bad acting  and a  plot   i use the word in its loosest possible sense  that served only to allow lots of sex and nudity  it stank  starship troopers has a bad script  bad acting  and a  plot  that serves only to allow lots of violence and gore  it stinks  nobody will watch this movie for the plot  but heres a brief synopsis anyway  some friends straight out of high school sign up for the federal reserve  armed forces  at a time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth from the other side of the galaxy  after one slips through the defences and destroys buenos aires  the home city of the main characters   war is declared  this involves sending the grunts  who include johnny rico  van dien  and dizzy  meyer   down to the surface of the bugs planet  much carnage ensues  the troops are withdrawn and sent to another planet to answer a distress call  more carnage ensues  after being rescued  their plans are changed to capture a  brain bug  which is believed to be controlling the aliens battle plans  look  i didnt write this  ok    yet more carnage ensues  get the picture  interspersed throughout all this are brief  ads  from the federal network  which present the picture of a neofascist state  much like in verhoevens robocop  there are many problems with starship troopers  the plot  where one exists to drive the movie onwards  is silly  harris  star of tvs doogie howser  md  is presented with a psychic ability to talk to his ferret early on in the movie  apparently so we will accept his ability to mindmeld with a  brain bug  later on  in addition  the first thirty minutes of the movie  until the characters sign up for service  drag on like a bad episode of beverly hills  90210  the characters are onedimensional  so much so  that when dizzy is killed  she says its ok because she got to sleep with rico  i had hoped that verhoevens use of a noname cast would allow him to kill off several of the lead characters to surprise the audience  but such an idea appears to have escaped him  the dialogue is embarassing and isnt helped by the frequently terrible delivery  i almost burst out laughing when harris delivered his speech about the need to sacrifice a few hundred people for the good of the species   finally  the fake  ads  become a nuisance  although they evoke the propaganda of the wwiiera movietone reels  as presumably they are meant to   their complete lack of subtlety blunts their effect  some people will say all of thats irrelevant  the movie hinges on the battle scenes  so what about those battle scenes  well  i admit the effects are good  the bugs move about quite convincingly  especially when they have been deprived of a few of their limbs  and people have their brains blown out  their limbs cut off  and their bodies ripped in two in quite impressive ways  but this is my problem  the entertainment value of the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore  and its continous attempt to gross us out  starting early on when richards character vomits onscreen   verhoeven appears to be trying to make a movie employing the elements that made a robocop a success  but fails spectacularly  while robocop had a message about the importance of being human  and gave the bad guys some motivation  starship troopers lacks even these simple features  when the brain bug sucks out a characters brain near the end of the film  its merely an analogy for what the film has done to us  this film is full of graphic violence and is not suitable for children under 16  
1	the following review encompasses two versions of dune  dune  the theatrical version  1984  runtime  137 minutes capsule review  cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives  the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book  the films visual splendour  mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative  dune  the extended version  1988  runtime  189 minutes capsule review  a bit of a throwtogether assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television  it was disowned by director david lynch but its considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline  quality dubs of this version from the outofprint japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web      the review    released in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of 40 million  the film of frank herberts cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by scifi fans  director david lynch  blue velvet  eraserhead  twin peaks  was working on his biggest production to date  a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico  the screenplay was lynchs own  chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected  dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors  the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis  dune   a windswept desert planet thats home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange  the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe  it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it  most importantly  it allows the navigators of the spacing guild  once human but now hideously mutated  to  fold space  and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously  enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish  lynchs film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the storys two main strands  one is the longstanding rivalry between two families  houses atreides and house harkonnen  and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis  the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah longawaited by the natives of arrakis  the fremen  the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld  and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom  unfortunately  this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film  which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended  the thinking among universals ohsowise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office  with lynchs initial cut running at closer to three or more hours  the studio demanded that further cuts be made  what a great idea  why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible  the most glaring consequence of this oneeyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative  leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters  thus their personalities are vague  their motivations unclear and  in the case of pauls father duke leto  their demise rather meaningless  the end result is a distinct chill  we cant warm to most of the cast and we dont care much for them  and it hardly helps that the voiceover narration is sparse and that the duneesque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book  dune is also a very serous film  the constant  selftalk  by various characters makes it so serious and selfabsorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment  the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them  humour  or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnens mad  sadistic kind  is hard to find  you may balk at the comparison  but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus star wars trilogy  the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster  however  it still possesses enough of lynchs stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative scifi  special effects whiz carlo rambaldis giant sandworms are an awesome sight  both the production design  anthony masters  and costume design  bob ringwood  are striking and original  and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years  with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis lush cinematography  the film is at least a feast for the senses  see it in the widescreen format if you can  and despite all the cuts  several cast members still make a strong impression  most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen  sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam  leader of the bene gesserit religious order whos secret aim is to manipulate pauls destiny for its own shadowy ends  as paul atreides  the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily  but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade  the conclusion  any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herberts original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker  david lynch took a brave stab at it and  partly due to forces beyond his control  ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects  dune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release  many chose to stay away altogether  as the films disastrous box office showing attests  the extended version  however  is a rather different beast  in 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition  directors cut  of the film on home video  a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres  but  alas  he failed to do so  choosing to move on to other projects  in a way  then  it is partly lynchs own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version  put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa  stung into action  lynch successfully petitioned the directors guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with  allen smithee   the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work  he also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous  judas booth   certainly  looking at the results of mcas handiwork theres at least half a dozen instances that  for sheer technical sloppiness  are good enough reasons for the director to object  but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas  most of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration  both of which fill many holes in the original versions storyline  pauls relationship with his father and associates is more intimate  with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously  the political skulduggery involving the emperor  the spacing guild  the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained  pauls initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably  and as further background  a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe  as a piece of storytelling  then  mca tvs version of dune is clearly superior  as a piece of editing  however  it is at times surprisingly inept  the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough  but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate  theres some sloppy cutting  too  and in a few instances shots even appear out of order  and the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes  eg  ships coming and going  soldiers coming and going  is at times clearly outofcontext  this is the kind of thing to which lynch objected  and rightly so  it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u  s  television  but the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasnt even in herberts book  the scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his  heart plug   its a surreal and disturbing episode thats very lynchesque but adds nothing to what we already know  the baron is a nasty piece of work  despite its own peculiar flaws  then  the extended version of dune is a generally superior film  all up  it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered  fabricated or newly created sequences  unless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart  the  alan smithee  version remains the closest well get to what the movie should have been  on repeated viewings  one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit  still  as one of this centurys great sciencefiction novels  some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen  with rumours circulating of a new six hour miniseries planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998  it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga  
0	plot  two teen couples go to a church party  drink and then drive  they get into an accident  one of the guys dies  but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life  and has nightmares  whats the deal  watch the movie and  sorta  find out    critique  a mindfuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea  but presents it in a very bad package  which is what makes this review an even harder one to write  since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold  mess with your head and such  lost highway  memento   but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films  and these folks just didnt snag this one correctly  they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept  but executed it terribly  so what are the problems with the movie  well  its main problem is that its simply too jumbled  it starts off  normal  but then downshifts into this  fantasy  world in which you  as an audience member  have no idea whats going on  there are dreams  there are characters coming back from the dead  there are others who look like the dead  there are strange apparitions  there are disappearances  there are a looooot of chase scenes  there are tons of weird things that happen  and most of it is simply not explained  now i personally dont mind trying to unravel a film every now and then  but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again  i get kind of fed up after a while  which is this films biggest problem  its obviously got this big secret to hide  but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes  and do they make things entertaining  thrilling or even engaging  in the meantime  not really  the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this  so we actually figured most of it out by the halfway point  so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense  but it still didnt the make the film all that more entertaining  i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is  into it  even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding  i mean  showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy   okay  we get it    there are people chasing her and we dont know who they are  do we really need to see it over and over again  how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie  apparently  the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves  and it shows  there mightve been a pretty decent teen mindfuck movie in here somewhere  but i guess  the suits  decided that turning it into a music video with little edge  would make more sense  the actors are pretty good for the most part  although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty  only in a new neighborhood  but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller  who holds her own throughout the entire film  and actually has you feeling her characters unraveling  overall  the film doesnt stick because it doesnt entertain  its confusing  it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime  despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it  oh  and by the way  this is not a horror or teen slasher flick    its just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids  it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since  whatever    skip it  wheres joblo coming from  a nightmare of elm street 3  710   blair witch 2  710   the crow  910   the crow  salvation  410   lost highway  1010   memento  1010   the others  910   stir of echoes  810  
0	what a contrast  in the space of two days  i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly  im not sure you could get two more different movies  while the former was all over the top  telegraphing everything  shoving its philosophy of life down our throats  hurlyburly was the complete opposite  wound so tight and with so much buried in its script  one could spend weeks thinking about it  this is one interesting movie  its very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of 98  in the company of men  although not quite so nasty  theres lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men  hurlyburly doenst contain much plot  we just follow eddie  sean penn  around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him  his big question is  does it all pertain to him  and if it does  how is he supposed to feel about it all    it  means everything  television  friends  events that happen  i guess it could be summed up more crudely as  whats it all about  this is not a movie for answers  donna  anna paquin  gives some but theyre not really satisfying  they just lead to more questions  thats what makes this movie stay on your mind  these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time  even when we push them to the background  however we resolve these questions influences everything we do  the performances are all superb in hurlyburly  i havent seen sean penn in much before  in fact  i cant remember seeing him in anything   but he is brilliant in this  eddie isnt a likeable character  but sean penn makes him understandable  i dont want to be his friend but id like to help him  chazz palminteri is also great as phil  making him an awful person  id never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend  everyone in this film nails their performances  making this world real  its a nasty world  its a sexist world  unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct  hurlyburly is a mans world  seen unapologetically through the eyes of men  i find this fascinating and on two counts  depressing  first  its depressing that such a world exists  a large part of hurlyburlys success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood  that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world  toys  playthings  sure  everyone is background to everyone else but in this world  women are a long way in the background  second  these are the movies that are being made  stories about mens world  where are the stories about womens world  not the soap operas and the  chick flicks  that are meant to satisfy women  but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men  hurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts  its very talkative  intelligent and static  while this can make the film drag a bit  and people sometimes sound like theyre quoting textbooks  mostly this is a good thing  not all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas  not all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience  all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen  it also means that you have to pay attention  
1	set in the wild west  this carry on centres around the arrival of the rumpo kid  sidney james  and his cronies in stodge city  his dodgy dealings and summary shootings aggravate judge burke  kenneth williams  so much that he asks sheriff albert earp  jon pertwee  to drive rumpo out of town  instead  the rumpo kid shoots the sheriff dead  therefore  judge burke sends for a law marshall to come in and clean up the city  due to a misunderstanding  an english sanitary engineer called marshall p  knutt  jim dale  is assigned  without knowing it  as the law marshall for stodge city  he arrives at the same time as annie oakley  angela douglas  who is seeking revenge for her father  the sheriffs murder  when marshall arrives at stodge city  he soon becomes aware of the misunderstanding and due to his rather limited intellect  he is manipulated by the rumpo kid and always ends up getting things wrong  in the end  there is a headtohead between rumpo and marshall  with the rumpos past experience  it would seem that marshall is out of his depth  but using his sanitary skills and learning the ways of the west from annie oakley  he at least stands some chance  sid james  with an american accent  is perfect as the rumpo kid  a part which suits him down to the ground  jim dale provides one of his best carry on performances as the stupid sanitary engineer  and angela douglas is very effective in her role as the revengeful daughter  other regulars that appear in this movie include charles hawtrey and bernard bresslaw  in his debut  as big heap and little heap respectively  big heap is the local indian leader and the crazy casting of hawtrey for this part is very amusing  as is his performance   he steals every scene he is in even though he does not enter the film until thirty minutes past  joan sims provides useful and amusing support as belle  the local bar owner who takes a fancy to the rumpo kid  however  the part of doc played by peter butterworth and sheriff albert earp played by jon pertwee are not really necessary  and pertwees performance is rather poor  kenneth williams uses a new voice but struggles with the weak part of the judge  even so  this carry on was sid james and kenneth williams favourite  a very different carry on film  in that it is played more seriously by the actors and possesses more realism than any other carry on  the death count is the highest of any carry on film  sets  costumes and action sequences are all very commendable  the songs that are included in the movie  the title song and annies song  are very impressive  a strange but therefore very interesting carry on film  not the best of its kind but it is certainly the most distinctive film of the series  
1	plot  a group of asbestos cleaners get a job removing the gunk from an old insane asylum  as each day passes  the crew members begin to discover things about the place and themselves which set other things in motion  saying anything else about the plot would be a crime  have fun    critique   i feel like shooting myself in the head  are the first words that came out of my mouth after seeing this movie  a good indication as to what kind of film to expect here  this aint your average  happy go lucky  kind of picture  this is a deliberately slowpaced mysteryhorror film drenched in atmosphere  with a very creepy insane asylum  in which most of the film takes place   very few clues upfront and lots to talk about afterwards  will it bore some people to sleep  you bet it will  is it made for the scream audiences of the day  absolutely not  i guess you can describe this film as a horror movie for the  cerebral crowd   a film that patiently unwraps itself frame after frame  giving away very little with each step and each sound  unwinding itself until its final scenes offer up a world of revelations and plenty more to discuss later  ive always loved movies that have me talking about them afterwards like the shining and lost highway and this film fits right into that group  in fact  i guess i can pussyfoot around the actual word all i want but the best way to describe this kind of movie is a  mindfuck   if you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowly  gives you a handful of characters with divergent backgrounds  tosses a few very ambiguous and supernatural cookies your way and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together  well  then this movie is definitely for you  its the kind of film that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate  damn  i missed that whole  peanut butter  thing   and one that will likely creep the shit out of you if watched alone in the dark    brrrrrrrrr    now what was that sound in the basement  honey  can you go check   and one thing this film doesnt have  unlike its hollywoodian counterparts like the haunting  is special effects  in fact  thats one of the greater things about this movie  it feels real because it looks like its actually taped on video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances  i did some research and it was  in fact  shot on digital video    ahha    another great thing about it is that its actually very gory and somewhat violent in theme  and yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the big screen  its mostly implied  kids    and as clich  d as it might be to say    its usually much scarier when stuff is left to our imagination or implied in movies as such  other films that this one reminded me of include henry  portrait of a serial killer and the blair witch project  with that same real sense of dread  brooding and terror  the film does however move awfully slow and if you really dont get  into  it completely  you really need to concentrate here   you will lose the motion of the story and the pentup tension might be released  but overall  this film is yet another great example of the horror genre making a very cool comeback this year with no tight tanktops in sight  and with david caruso acting like the king hotshot like only he can  how can you go wrong  definitely not a film for everyone but a mustsee for anyone looking to throw themselves into the psyche of the disturbed  count me in    stanley kubrick would be proud  oh yeah    so wheres that gun again     wheres joblo coming from  the blair witch project  410   blair witch 2  710   the haunting  310   the house on haunted hill  710   lost highway  1010   the pledge  610   the shining  910   the sixth sense  810   unbreakable  810  
1	im not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream  but im guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write a second draft  seriously  this ideaa psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legendsis a great one and i wish it could have been pulled off  the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue  an example   that car crash mustve been awful    for everyone involved   you can tell that the writer intended that something a little more airy was supposed to have been said  just no one figured out what  i know in slasher movies there isnt supposed to be a lot of great characterization and i myself dont mind cardboard cutouts  but please dont let the cutouts be so damn bland  one reason movies like scream  star wars and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters  aside from jared leto and joshua jackson  who arent on the screen long enough  no one in urban legend makes the grade  alicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill  rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive  not to mention as dumb as a post through 34 of the film  and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot  good thing brad dourif is here  but wait    hes only in the movie for five minutes and hes just redoing his goodnatured stuttering character from one flew over the cuckoos nest  which brings me to another aspect of urban legend  its unoriginality  the film most blatantly ripped off is scream  another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after cravens and williamsons great success   urban legend tries to deconstruct modernday folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films  but it doesnt quite succeed  its best stab at selfreflexivity is poking fun at  that girl in the noxzeema ad   ie  rebecca gayheart  we also have another killertauntinghisvictimonthephone routine in urban legend and quick  what movie is this exchange of dialogue from  female protagonist  why  villain  why  why    congratulations to those of you who answered scream andor urban legend  like i said  this movie couldve been great  if only silvio had worked or been allowed to work a little longer on the script  still  at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes and a somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than i know what you did last summer  
0	i know that  funnest  isnt a word    fun  is a noun  and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective  but thats the word that came to me right after viewing  chicken run   no wonder  this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions  like  that was the funnest movie ive ever seen   so to hell with websters   chicken run  is one of the funnest movies ive seen in a while  i cant remember the last time ive seen anything funner  the chickens at tweedys farm are up to something  living in a concentration camplike atmosphere  they are led by one plucky hen called ginger  voice of julia sawalha  who continually comes up with plans for escape  and always gets caught  subsequently spending day after day in the coal box  one night  a brash american rooster flies in over the fence  calling himself rocky  mel gibson   famous flying rooster and circus performer  rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly  and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs  tweedy  miranda richardson  decides to abandon the farms eggselling plan for a pieselling plan  she orders a huge piemaking machine  cackling   chickens go in  pies come out   what sort of pies  chicken pies  of course  codirector nick park and his studio  aardman animation  produced three oscarwinning short films   creature comforts    the wrong trousers   and  a close shave   the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace  gromit  a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures  part of what made the  wallace  films brilliantly entertaining was parks uncanny ability to make an old story seem new    the wrong trousers   for example  pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks  and  a close shave  owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories  but in the hands of park and his team  the stories felt fresh and inspired  and not the least bit contrived  now teaming with codirector peter lord  park has created a similar creature in  chicken run   the plot is largely lifted from  the great escape   watch for a quick reference to the ballbouncing scene   with some spielberginspired action sequences providing the excitement  thing is  the film doesnt feel like its been lifted from somewhere else   chicken run  feels fresh  alive  like nothing else ever done  part of it is the original idea  who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisonersofwar movie starring chickens  park and lord milk the incongruity for all its worth  the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious  and to them  it is  but theyre  chickens   so its funny to us  another thing that helps  chicken run   and most of parks films  succeed is the animators subtle way of giving nods to the very films theyre cribbing  there are references to  the great escape   obviously  and  stalag 17   the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both  raiders of the lost ark  and  indiana jones and the temple of doom   theres even a nod to  the blues brothers   if you can believe it  and the filmmakers even get in a little lighthearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor  taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibsons nationality and film history  the  braveheart  reference is a hoot if you catch it  when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one   chicken run  is downright brilliant in its execution  consider this  since july of last year  ive seen dozens upon dozens of  blair witch project  parodies  on television  on the radio  and online  out of all those  maybe one or two were amusing  the rest tiresome  why  because once you got past the thought that  theyre parodying that blair witch movie   most of the parodies had nothing to offer  no insight  no original idea  no greater purpose  they were only funny if you had seen the movie  otherwise  you got nothing  conversely   chicken run  doesnt lean on its parodies  the film references are never the sole focus of any scene  if youve never seen  indiana jones   the chase sequence is still fun  even if you have no idea who mel gibson is  rocky remains an interesting character  park  lord  and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before its understood  and as a result   chicken run  is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious  but not quite vague either  enjoyment of this movie doesnt require knowledge of film history  but if youve got it   chicken run  is that much richer  the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances  and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that its hard not to fall in love with every one of them  ginger is perfect  spunky and opinionated  but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind  and julia sawalha  known as the cute mousy girl on  absolutely fabulous   nails it  she has warm  human chemistry with gibson  whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gungho veneer  the characters inevitable romance doesnt feel contrived  but sweet  poor mr  tweedy  tony haygarth  suspects the chickens are organizing in some way  but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out  and his overbearing wife certainly isnt any help  jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs  a hen that runs away with most of the best oneliners  all while perpetually crocheting a sweater   and two supplytrading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swingdancing sequence  they even come up with an inspired riff on something thats baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades  the chicken vs  egg dilemma  one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome  but as with most of  chicken run   it comes as a delightful surprise  the film manages to cross all barriers  it should be accessible to both children and adults  brits and yanks  rats and chickens  the animation is firstrate  remember that this was all done the oldfashioned way  with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit  and you see just how truly remarkable  chicken run  really is  this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great  precise and unwavering attention to detail  as in such topnotch family fare as  a bugs life  or  toy story 2    chicken run  has something to offer in nearly every frame  certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes  but a active  attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because theyll catch all the details  anyway  the movies just a boatload of fun  funnest damn movie ive seen all year  
1	a cinematic version of one of john irvings novels is always cause for celebration even if  as in the case of  simon birch   the treatment is merely  suggested by   rather than strictly based on  the book  suggested means that irving  author of the acclaimed  the world according to garp   sold the rights to his novel  a prayer for owen meany  to the disney machine for 1 million  but wouldnt grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names  thats an odd decisionirving claims its to protect both himself and the novelbut its one that doesnt unduly harm the finished product  irvings books are rich and complex works  full of intriguing  colorful characters    a prayer for owen meany  is no exception  it tells the story of an unusual boycalled simon birch in the film versionwho is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a highpitched falsetto voice   like strangled mice   simon believes himself to be  gods instrument   placed on this earth to somehow effect gods plan  simon is played by ian michael smith  who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which  among other things  prevents bones  ligaments  and joints from developing normally  smiths debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for  simon birch   however  the producers unwisely favored form over functionsmiths acting abilities are limited at best  another drawback is that in the book  simons condition is described the way irving describes any of his charactersin careful  loving detail  watching  simon birch   however  creates a different feeling altogether  the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character  surely something irving would not have intended  simon himself tends to be too cute and irritating  a combination of smiths rookie status as an actor and the precocious oneliners hes forced to deliver  courtesy mark steven johnson  the films director and screenwriter  fortunately  simon birch isnt the real star of the film that bears his name  simon is more of a catalyst  allowing his costars to shape the story  and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances  saving the film from an obsequious  manipulative destiny  first and foremost is joseph mazzello   jurassic park    who is nothing less than remarkable as simons best friend  joe  mazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old  ripe with laughter  pain  and tears  he is certainly an emerging talent  ashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca  joes single mother  and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend  ben  david strathairn and jan hooks play the towns reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others  theres even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from    well  that would be telling  perhaps  suggested by  the novel is the appropriate way to go after all  since  simon birch  only focuses on one chapter  one year  of simons extraordinary life  the film also changes the books ending to one that is more melodramatic  yet necessary given simons lot  the flavor of irvings original novel remains  howeverthe passions  friendships  and insecurities that come with a change of seasons to the little community of gravestown  maine  and the engaging oddballs  both big and small  who reside there

0	running time approximately 1hr 40mins reviewed by jack choo rating  the movie starts with a rather se7enish opening sequence  rather cool and sets the mood for things to come  the story propels the audience into a neoreality  somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of blue and red  existenz is actually the name of a new virtualreality game  supposedly  vr games are highly popular as is considered a legaldrug in this neoreality        leigh  is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate gameexperience in the form of existenz  players are required to have bioports embedded in their spine  which plugs to a gamepod in order to enjoy the immersive experience  during a secretive betatestingcumteaser meeting for this new game  an assassination attempt on    life occurs and she runs off with fellow bodyguard     law       is more of a realists than anything else  afraid that hell lose reality if he begin to play these games but    requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt  as they soon discover  they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected  existenz has all the cronenberggore that is expected of him  even so  this film is nowhere near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners  not even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly  existenz can probably be looked upon as his 90s version of videodrome  even so  it is a poor followup  while in most of his famed films  his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot  in existenz  the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of overindulgence than anything else  jennifer jason leigh and jude law  both commendable actors  looked aloof and missdirected throughout the entire film  the scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the bgrade category  it was obvious that cronenberg worked on a really tightbudget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film  the opening sequence  though  probably formed a considerable portion of the budget   which is actually quite good  existenz is too predictable and cliched in these times  10 years ago  it would have been another classic for cronenberg  cronenberg fans however   those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film  should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you  
1	ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances  for his followup to the academybeloved the english patient  he has once again turned to a love story  this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong  little women   despite some obvious overplotting  oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences  the film opens in the mid1800s  with parallel storylines in new south wales  australia and devon  england  as the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us  lucinda leplastrier  cate blanchett  is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback  meanwhile  half the world away  oscar hopkins  fiennes  has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues  and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest  lucinda is fascinated with glass  oscar is obsessed with theology  lucinda is rich  oscar is poor  lucinda is forward and selfassured  oscar is timid and uncertain of himself  yet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals  the compulsion to gamble  whether its on horses  dogs  cards  or the flip of a coin  and fate has decreed that they will one day meet  that day doesnt occur until 45 minutes into the film  when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney  australia  where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help  another of the passengers is lucinda  who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newlyacquired glassworks factory  at first  their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor  but it doesnt take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other  a friendship is born  and  once they reach australia  it develops into something more potent  but oscar is uncertain of lucindas affection  and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her  oscar and lucinda isnt beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response  and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions  on more than one occasion  its apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route  coincidence is a crucial plot device  without it  this movie cant go anywhere  the voiceover narration  never one of my favorite techniques  is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments    however  without it  the final twist  which i will not reveal  would not be as poignant   yet  despite these quibbles  i enjoyed oscar and lucinda  storyline faults pale in the light of two such finelyrealized characters  thematically  the film is also strong  the unifying motif  that everything in life is a gamble  is successfully delineated  oscar and lucinda dont just wager their money  they bet their hearts  minds  and souls  a card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional  strip poker  where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared  secret passion  oscar does not see gambling as a vice  in fact  he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting ones immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith  ralph fiennes  who normally plays strong  confident men  is very much at home as the fumbling  insecure oscar  the actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part  all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is onscreen  as good as fiennes is  however  he is eclipsed by cate blanchett  the actress  who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresfords paradise road  is mesmerizing as lucinda  she gives this liberated woman her flash  and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles  effective support is provided by ciaran hinds  the male lead in jane austens persuasion  as lucindas close friend  tom wilkinson  the full monty  as oscars mentor  and clive russell as a selfserving adventurer  theres a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story  keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence    in fact  i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act  which has oscar and lucinda together   with the skill of a consummate storyteller  she weaves romance  friendship  passion  humor  and tragedy together into a complete package  the characters  with all of their human foibles and neuroses  are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett  so who cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy  oscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer  
0	i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews  and in both instances  he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon  now  i personally remember those films as a  starring a major motion picture star b  being funny c  having great action sequences d  great chemistry e  decent character development  hmmm     okay    now on to my review of chill factor  plot  a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an exarmy general  to propose a nuclear device to international prospects  when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps  they must keep it cool on ice  and rush it over to an army base  before the contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit  and kills millions of people  critique   speed on an icecream truck  is probably the pitch that was used to sell this onetone movie to its backers  but unfortunately  the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tensionfilled  original two hours of cinema  is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film  and the lethal weapon movies  stood for  this film is seasoned in cliches  with plenty of badly written dialogue  over the top acting from cuba gooding jr   zero chemistry between the two leads  and horribly tacky bad guys  tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe  my friend and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent  because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously  written   that we just had to crack up  that  and the formula for the films script which followed the proverbial 12  and you guessed it    3 scenario  and what about all those catchy  hip names to get us to relate to the characters      elvis  and  nighshift   oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters  and yes  it actually took two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel   it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr  got involved in this oneweekoldbluecheesesmelling project  did they actually think that it would boost their careers  or did they know that the script sucked  but discounted any fall from grace  knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall  most probably the latter  have you seen either fled or bulletproof  well  despite the slight differences in plot  the essentials are basically the same here  you get a black guy and a white guy being chased by a bunch of people  having no choice but to work together to get somewhere  hating each other at first  but over time  learning to respect one another as individuals  yawn  add to that  the fact that our film actually has bad guys who are all dressed in black  drive black cars and black vans  and run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head  not too conspicuous  eh  call me a partypooper  but as much as i like a nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy  this film just doesnt even try to do anything original or reasonably entertaining  one cool scene with a boat careening down a mountainside  and another with a nuclear device obliterating everything on an island  do not a fun  buddyaction flick make  show cuba the money  everybody     little known facts about this film and its stars  this is not a little known fact or anything  but damn  is it just me or does skeet ulrich look an awful lot like greatlooking actor johnny depp  skeets reallife nicknames include chester  skeeter and mosquito  he stands 61   was born in north carolina  and got married in 1997 to that sexkitten actress from clay pigeons  7  510   georgina cates  they own a farm together in virginia and seven dogs  skeet has a long scar on his chest from openheart surgery done when he was 10 to correct a ventricle defect  actor cuba gooding jr  was born in the bronx  new york  in 1984  he breakdanced during the closing ceremonies of the olympic games in los angeles  he stands 510   actress hudson leick  who plays one of the  bad guysgirls  in his movie  is better known from her role as  callisto  on the popular tv series  xena  princess warrior   this film reportedly had a budget of 40 million   im not exactly sure where all this money went  but it certainly did not register onscreen  interestingly enough  director hugh johnson  who makes his big screen debut with this film  was the cinematographer on the 1996 film white squall and the 1997 demi moore vehicle  g  i  jane  6  510   
0	denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances  this perhaps may be washingtons very best to date  he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent  this season  to become his character  copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly  his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting  the hurricane  a much better film than it actually is  when his rubin  hurricane  carter feels pain and is tormented by racism  he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy  disgust  and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices  the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago  the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone  as his tortured carter  sum up the troubles of racism in americas history  he is that amazing  the problem with  the hurricane  is that when compared to washington  all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles  mainly because the script focuses so much on carter  that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors  this is  without a doubt  washingtons movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying  it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars  denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance  as rubin carter  we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system  from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit  then after a successful marriage and boxing career  he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder  carters second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous  powerful white men who refused to let him succeed  from these past experiences in jail  carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america  after several court appeals  an autobiography  and many public marches for his freedom  carter remained locked in prison  it was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carters book in the 1980s  that a serious battle for freedom took place  the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released  the greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation  washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again  he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career  the devastation in washingtons eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it  in the hole  carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot  his anger is heightened to a point of no control  we see multiple carters  a violent angry one  a silent passive one  and a mediator  we see an emotional boxing match inside carters head  from this point in the hole to the end of the film  this fight continues  it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite  when carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison  the angry carter at first erupts  white people have been trying to hurt him his whole life  this reminder leads to anger in his head  however  as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him  he realizes that society is changing  that racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world  very rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here  if only the other actors had this same determination  dan hedaya  ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around  it felt like his character was taken straight out of a  scooby doo  episode  he would have gotten away with it if it wasnt for those annoying little kids    the kids  in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable  the lawyers who help release carter also are underused  as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard  the complete opposite of his character in  shawshank redemption    there is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears  hedaya was superb in  clueless   same for david paymer in  get shorty   harris yulin in  ghostbusters  and liev schreiber in  the daytrippers   it is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles  on the other hand  it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin  hurricane  carter  this role is about as far off from shallow as you can get  
0	  flubber  is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation  and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney  its the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids  but anyone else will feel left out as its boring  slow  and incredibly lifeless  what could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water  and its a shame because it could have been a great film  hypothetically  i mean    flubber   as you probably know  is a remake of the disney classic i never saw   the absent minded professor   where a  well  absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as  flubber   you know  flying rubber  the new one keeps the basic plot  but appears to have added a lot else  like more absentmindedness on the part of the proffessor  some more villains  and several  showstopping  moments  like a big rumba with the flubber  and some more elaborate setups  none which really make it any better  but instead make it worse  the basic plot revolves around a college professor  philip brainerd  robin williams   who creates lots and lots of inventions  but is sadly absent minded  in fact  hes forgotten his wedding to the colleges president  sara jean reynolds  indie actress marcia gay harden   two times before he forgets it again at the beginning  doesnt this warrant some kind of mental treatment  anyway  on his wedding day  the third one   he invents the flubber  which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed  but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in  the abyss   philip believes that this invention  once fully realized  will save his college  which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoonvillain  chester hoenicker  raymond j  barry   which is ironically enough the same college his brat son  will wheaton  thought he was dead  goes to  through a plot twist  hoenickers goons  named smith and wesson  ha ha  what a great sense of humor this film has  who are played by clancy brown and ted levine  both who needed the pay check   discover it the hard way  and try to steal for hoenicker  who wants it just cause hes evil enough  a subplot involves philips attempts to win back sara  whos angry at him  and with good reason   but who is being seduced by who is basically philips belloq  wilson croft  christopher mcdonald  playing the hysterically suaveyetunsuave asswhole once again   and in another subplot  philips daytimer robot  weebo  voiced by the oneandonly jodi benson   falls in love with him  yuckityyuck  whats most pathetic about this film is how dull it is  you dont need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film  which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney  who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry  halfassedly remixing classics  or nonclassics  for distribution to the general public  who sadly eats it all up  earlier in 97  they released  jungle 2 jungle   an adaptation of a really awful french film   un indien dans la ville   which  yeah  improved over the original  but not by much  disneys in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now  only creatively  in the rush to ship out a film for distribution  disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called  magic   such scenes as dancing flubber  a flying car  a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber  and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze  delight  or even cause people to laugh  i sat there the entire film stone faced  chuckling perhaps twice  and shaking my head at all the bad jokes  who could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry  didnt think so  it doesnt help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable  philip is not a lovable absent minded professory  just a really dumb man being played by robin williams  williams is a brilliant comic actor    okay  a brilliant actor in general  but here hes given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something  and other times act sad  those times  hes not bad  but what are we supposed to think of a man whos forgotten his wedding thrice  maybe it was funny andor respectable in the 60s    i like disney  and i usually enjoy their films  not only animated but live action  and their recent films  save for  hercules   which was good  but not great  have been worse than lackluster  theyve been pathetic    jungle 2 jungle  is probably the worst film i saw last year    flubber  s probably second  what do they need to do  perhaps create something new  get writers who can write something thats universally entertaining  films like  the parent trap  and  mary poppins  are films that are live action  or in the latter case a mix of both   but even i can still watch them because theyre not only written to be magical to children  but to be fun to adults  whats more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you and annoys you at every turn  and my god  couldnt they have done something else with edie mcclurg  
0	  virus  is the type of cliched  vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it  strangely enough  on the same midjanuary weekend last year  another film was released like this   deep rising   about an ugly monster on a cruise liner  prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989s  leviathan   1989s  deep star six   and all four  alien  pictures    virus   in comparison  is a servicable thriller  wellmade and produced  but since it doesnt include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence  it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on  based on a series of comic books   virus  concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat  which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon  after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking   un  lucky for them  a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen  once the team reaches the russian ship  they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted  after turning the power back on  however  there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship  and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself  one survivor finally does turn up  nadia  joanna pacula   who informs the suicidal and stern captain  donald sutherland  and one of the crew  kit foster  jamie lee curtis   that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship  taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out  if  virus  sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies  youre correct  although the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life  the film itself doesnt appear to have a brain in its head  the film sticks so close to the wornout conventions of the  creature  genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film  the actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past  but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play  in her second return to horror in the last year  jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine  but that is about it  although 1998s  halloween  h20  was also a disappointment  at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character  unlike here  donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films  such as 1994s  the puppet masters   although i just watched him in the superb 1978 scifi classic  invasion of the body snatchers   where he was fabulous  the last of the three topbillers is william baldwin  but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture  since he has nothing to do  basically   virus  is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space shipocean linerhaunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them onebyone  it is not the worst of its type  but it is far from one of the best  and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this  as long as some of them keep making money  i suspect the answer is never  
0	warning  anyone offended by blatant  leering machismo had better avoid this film  or lots of blood  guts  men against men and manoetmano stuff  in other words  its a walter hill film  with a john milius script  i always picture these guys getting together and producing a movie between armwrestling matches  these films always contain male characters i have a very hard time identifying with  probably due to the likelihood that any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb  and we got tough guys galore  here  drugrunning banditos by the dozens  all dirty and sweaty and pretty illtempered  overall  a secret task force of army commandos who are in the area to coverup  supposedly  any connection between the government and the drug runners  and lots of shitkicking texas dirt farmers whod as soon shoot you between the eyes as look at you  in particular  we got nick nolte as one hardass texas ranger  powers boothe as the drug kingpin  michael ironsides as the leader of the secret army  and rip torn as the local sheriff  torn is the sympathetic figure of the group  he smiles before shooting anyone  as to women    well  ive never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film  and at this rate  i doubt i ever will  women exist here to look good  comfort the man  and get argued over  gosh  just like the old days    frankly  this is a pretty good movie  if you can accept the premise and can take the macho stuff  the cinematography is excellent  the cast of characters is broad and has texture  the script is quite good  and the film lets you keep up with whats happening yourself  without spelling it out to you  i appreciate a film that makes me have to think to keep up  finally  theres lots of sam peckinpah slowmotion shootups  
1	plot  a little boy born in east germany  named hansel  loves the american music  one day  he gets the opportunity to meet and marry an american g  i   but first  he must get a sex change  enter hedwig   once married  the two move to the states  but quickly thereafter  get a divorce  at that point  hedwig starts writing music and meets another confused boy  who soon turns into a star  that boy also turns his back on hedwig  and it isnt long before hedwig puts together hisher own band and tours the states via seafood restaurants  this is the story of hisher life  told via flashbacks and musical numbers  critique  an artsyfartsy musical with great songs and a superb performance by john cameron mitchell  doesnt really come together as a whole  with overthetop symbolism  incoherence and too much pretension to retain my interest all the whole way through  in fact  this isnt so much of a realistic  articulate  behindthescenes look at the rise of a rock n roll star  as it is an ambiguous  overly poetic and incomprehensible struggle of a man  his sexuality and his identity as a whole person on this planet  i guess that i was expecting the former going in  the film is somewhat interesting to a point  but i was personally never able to involve myself too much  as the basic symbolic and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold and distant  but it is definitely tuned to a certain type of audience  chances are that if you are a fan of the wall  the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla  queen of the desert  the elements tangled in this movie will likely strike your fancy  some of the characters in this film even ask the audience to sing along at some point  and provide the lyrics of their song  onscreen   well  i personally dont care for those films  and didnt really get into the whole  show  atmosphere of this movie either  i guess i mightve looked at it all too literally  but like i said earlier  i just didnt care enough about the characters to delve into the  so the butterfly represents his freedom   side of things  all i know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered and didnt make me feel any more fulfilled  what was hedwigs relationship with that other member of his band  with the beard   what happened with hedwig and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie    was that an actual sequence or a fantasy   what ever happened to the lawsuit  and more    all of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat  if the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover hisher sexuality  then thats one thing  but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie  i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well  i didnt get it  the films humor also didnt tickle my funny bone either  then again  ive seen many a film in these arthouse theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter  while all i see is a tiny bit of whimsy on the screen  some of these films are also better enjoyed with the added  atmosphere  of a plant called marijuana  and i can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements  in order to jazz up that experience  but being sober as i was and expecting a coherent  funny  musical with a transsexual twist  i didnt leave the theater very satisfied  i came out having watched an existential story of a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle  wrapped in metaphors  dramatics and more questions than answers  i will  on the other hand  definitely hand some props out to the lead in this film  john cameron mitchell  who is also the man who wrote  directed and created the play on which this movie is based  and the tunes  which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols  david bowie and the whole 70s glamrock scene  note  btw  it seems as though pretty much every single  mainstream  critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom  and thought that it was really funny to boot    so you might want to take that into consideration yourself  but having said that  the main reason that i started this dinky website in the first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the  official  critics  while i  a regular  joblo  in the audience  just wouldnt get what all the fuss was about  this movie is a perfect example of why i continue to write movie reviews  wheres joblo coming from  moulin rouge  810   grease  810   everyone says i love you  510   the opposite of sex  810   dancer in the dark  510   o brother  where art thou  710   loves labours lost  810

1	often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into  the call of the oboe  o toque do oboe  is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray  many elements of the film are solid  and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know  but they simply dont convert into a solid work  although a setting is never established  it becomes apparent  the film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day  the community is a dull one  where every day is a downhill slide from the last  over time  the people have taken to themselves  the town cinema is closed  no tourist has passed through in years  and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger  so what happens when a  tourist   paolo betti  does arrive one day  he sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock  it is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby  when he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance  the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years  it is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers  and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film  thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages  the woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner  leticia vota  who also happens to be engaged to the towns police inspector  a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiances involvement with this musician  the rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray  it features a character who literally rises from his grave  a woman who has a phone conversation with god  and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character  to an almost humorous drunk  technically  this film is a nightmare  the music score is poorly edited into the film  so it is often choppy  rough  and abrupt  the lighting is poor at best  which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes  and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words  and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases  this translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue  but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words  in addition  the pace of the film seems uneven  it opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test ones patience  the film then moves into a faster pace  that again slows towards the end  as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark  there was  however  potential for this film  it is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music  and the reunification of people  these are all topics that could easily fill a movie  perhaps  if there were no freak show  and the technical aspects were to improve  there might just be a thing of beauty at the end  most importantly  though  the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours arent such a bore  until then  there seems to be little more hope for this piece  than that boy has by simply crying out  mommy  while he wanders astray in a park  
0	way of the gun is brimming with surprises  some good  most bad  one of the good ones is ryan phillippes surprisingly halfway decent performance  after the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer  he hinted at a bit growth in last years cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance  though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark  precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart  presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans  and start bellyaching about how hed fallen for his  target   it was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the films director could negotiate  but he seems to be trying and that shouldnt be overlooked  or probably over praised  seeing as how  at this point  he really isnt required to do much but look pretty  here  phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard  his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his  look here  see  glory  its tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass  but his performance actually helps with the illusion  unlike ben afflecks puppy dog approach in reindeer games  phillippe is believable and not too bad at that  as for the plot  well  thats one of the bad surprises  phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic  and not even remotely likeable  criminals  introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people  who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother  juliette lewis  after overhearing that shes carrying the baby of painter  scott wilson   a very well connected wealthy man  the kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed  but the antiheroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man  james caan  and two scheming bodyguards  taye diggs and nicky katt  remain in pursuit  directed by christopher mcquarrie  the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects  an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles  this one included   way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity  unlike phillipe  mcquarrie doesnt seem to be growing at all  he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies i know ive seen before and worse  it feels like it  the film lacks even a fresh approach  like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey  to its clich  s  all of which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is  it features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life  even attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life  philosophy  etc  i didnt like the bit much when it first appeared in heat  here  its even more self consciously  dramatic   usual suspects  which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies  worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending  nowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur  never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential  thus  nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret  most amateurishly projected before they appear  and it too has an ironic little twist at the end  nothing earth shattering  like in the usual suspects  but i admit  i didnt see it coming  and i smiled  however most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects  a lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason  or substance  its just as overplotted as suspects  and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters  a distinctive style  or a good script would be  even the good stuff  most of which involves james caan  doing a fine job   feels odd and out of place in a movie that thinks lines like  karma is only justice with out the satisfaction  are clever  at one point caan laments  need is the ultimate monkey  a line so inexplicable he might as well have said  love is like hippo ass   ive seen porno with better dialogue  and some with better plot lines too  but rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast  i mean  can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy   caan slips into this role with seeming ease  he could do this kind of softspoken tough guy in a coma  but he manages to give his character depth and weariness  benicio del torro is always welcome  though here he plays it fairly straight  rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage   adopting a brad pittesque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering  speaking of pitt  his ex  juliette lewis  is a weak link  either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness  or waddling about like a silly goose  nicky katt was brilliant in a brief role in the limey  here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted  hes only kept around for his cold presence  taye diggs has a similar function  cool as ever  but never a character  though the guy has one helluva death scene  for the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippos ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns  its vaguely tarantinoish  but in a bad truth and consequences nm way  with phillippe  in one scene  leaping into a stupid rant about  faggots  migrating to los angeles  you know the routine  the final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo  who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo  with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at  but those gun shots sure crack like thunder  just the other day i was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak elephant gruntlike sound that emanated from harrys fetishized smith and wesson  oh how far weve come

0	i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set  unless im watching a movie  i dont even have cable  so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching  the xfiles  every sunday night  its the only show thats worth an hour of my time each week  though  since i dont watch reruns  im glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether   i am an avid fan of the show  and have been for about three years now  and i love gillian anderson  the xfiles is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off  the film is like a twohour episode  except that there are a lot more special effects  the plot is thicker  and the resolution is more satisfying  this is a terrific film  both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it  i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment   i expected to like it more than any episode ive seen  and my expectations were met  actually  the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices  but  thankfully  the makers managed to do it right  when the finale ended  the fbi branch known as the xfiles had been destroyed  and our heroes  mulder  david duchovny  and scully  gillian anderson  were left stripped of five years of hard work  the film picks up soon after  and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building  but wait  im getting ahead of myself  the film actually opens in the ice age  about 32  000 years prior  during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien  the aliens blood infects them  fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer   and the story jumps into modern times  during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer  it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy  and mulder and scully uncover the coverup despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi  soon  they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens  as ive written before  its not easy to write plot summaries for films like this  because everything needs to be a surprise  fans of the show will know what to expect  and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film  director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen  making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television  there are some truly suspenseful and wellcreated scenes here  late in the film  when theyre in the alien spacecraft  youll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema   the special effects are very good  and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic  what i find interesting is that the xfiles is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story  our heroes are given subtle introductions  were not expected to know them on the outset   and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isnt required to understand the film  there are  of course  little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans  but ill keep those as surprises  it takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides  and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly  the series is strong for a lot of reasons  its original  though it has many ties to  the twilight zone  and owes some homage to hitchcock   and impressively eerie for a television show  what really makes the series shine  however  are the actors  duchovny has so much presence  and is just a fun guy to watch  he has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man  anderson is equally good  and paralyzingly beautiful  shes also a strong actress  both performers have acted in little more than their series  however  though i think theyll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon  i enthusiastically recommend the xfiles  both for fans and nonfans  1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters  and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry  its an intelligent film  and takes you places that you might not have been  or  at least  might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar   the xfiles is impressive in concept  as well  fans of the series are likely to be highly critical  and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move  its nice to see a risk pay off for a change  actually  its nice to see a risk at all

1	youve got mail works alot better than it deserves to  in order to make the film a success  all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars  have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits  no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in its body  its basically a complete reshoot of the shop around the corner  only adding a few modern twists   essentially  it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking  its overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy  not to mention very manipulative  but oh  how enjoyable that manipulation is  but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does  because i absolutely hated the previous ryanhanks teaming  sleepless in seattle  it couldnt have been the directing  because both films were helmed by the same woman  i havent quite yet figured out what i liked so much about youve got mail  but then again  is that really important  if you like something so much  why even question it  again  the storyline is as cliched as they come  tom hanks plays joe fox  the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley  the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a familyrun childrens book shop called  in a nice homage  the shop around the corner  fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business  little do they know  they are already in love with each other over the internet  only neither party knows the other persons true identity  the rest of the story isnt important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen  sure  there are some mildly interesting subplots  but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship  all of this  of course  leads up to the predictable climax  but as foreseeable as the ending is  its so damn cute and welldone that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does  when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love  i was filled with such  for lack of a better word  happiness that for the first time all year  i actually left the theater smiling

1	bats is this years camp flick  with the worlds worst dialogue  cheesiest premise and stupidest editor  this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity  as for the rest of us  well    id say skip it  but looking at the box office figures for this one  it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway  follow their lead and youll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and 8 bucks to boot  i love alfred hitchcocks the birds  almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based  it saddens me even more  then  to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horrorschlock such as bats  when mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town  the authorities call in a batologist  dina meyer  to investigate  it turns out that a creepy scientist  bob gunton  has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab  making them smarter and more vicious  why has he done this  you ask  because  you see  it is apparently a scientists job to make things  a little better   even if that means the death of all mankind  so the batologist  her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff  lou diamond phillips  have to kill all the bats and save the world  of course  that cant happen before they wallow in some guamo  bat shit  for the uninitiated   get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture  consider  for example  a scene where two people are in a bat cave  the bats are all sleeping  but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out  what do they do  do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can  nope  they stand there for a while  transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes  what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes  we dont even get to see whats going on  the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick  all we know is that bats are attacking  how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery  a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies  and bats sure could use some  of course  director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor  but it is so conventional it doesnt really go anywhere  most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologists wisecracking sidekick  leon   who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like  i hate bats   some of these are so bad that they take on a double quality  they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because they are so inept  i hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame oneliners  playing such characters does not help actors careers  still  i suppose that if youre looking for a movie that is  so bad its good   you could do worse than bats  it does have a tremendous amount of camp value  im not  recommending  the movie because  quite frankly  it sucks  and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it  more power to them  
1	the happy bastards 30second review big daddy happy gilmore as a father  of course  thats the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy  a movie thats passable but isnt really considered some of sandlers best work  he doesnt actually play happy gilmore in the movie  but a variation of him  hes sonny coufax  a man whos living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his onedayaweek gig as a tollbooth man  tollbooth willie    his girlfriend  kristy swanson  is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him  enter a 5year old kid  whos mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate  jon stewart   whos off in china on a business trip  from there  coufax basically acts as the kids father  teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks  he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker  joey lauren adams   but  somehow  he also garners the attention of social services  who arent particularly pleased with coufaxs actions  as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid  the reason i say its not really sandlers best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie  showing some odd feelings that somehow didnt really belong in a sandler vehicle  i mean  it fits the movies tone and everything  and sandler handles it well  but its just oddly placed  thats all  fortunately  it doesnt destroy the goofy glee path its been following and it still makes you feel good  sandler does a good job here  as he does in most of his movies  rob schneider  however  is irritating as his friend  an immigrant delivery boy who cant read  stewart  in his minor time on screen  is great  and adams remains a joy to watch  look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum  hes a hoot  directed by dennis dugan  director of happy gilmore   the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with  again  there are faults  but  hey  everyone needs to get emotional sometimes  
1	when people are talking about good old times  they actually want to make some bad times look better  nice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s  for new generations  superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion  cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids  for people who actually had to live in that period  it was the gloomy decade  marked by lost ideals of 1968  rampant inflation and unemployment  international terrorism  fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for  feelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era  martin scorseses taxi driver  which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies  is most celebrated of them all  the movies protagonist is travis bickle  robert de niro   26year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he cant sleep at nights  the job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis  and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world  the only bright spot in his life is betsy  cybil sheperd   attractive woman working in senator palantines presidential campaign  their date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre  losing his only link to better side of the world  travis gradually descends into psychosis  becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street  he purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict  that conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris  jodie foster   12year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi  as many great movies that got cult status through the years  taxi driver became the object of many interpretations  for some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski  loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty  overpopulated industrial cities  the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times  for others  the movie uses raskolnikovlike figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america  its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade  brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides  his travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today  many of us share his feelings of isolation  loneliness and outrage towards crime  drugs  prostitution and senseless street violence  his pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him  sometimes in most unusual circumstances  like with secret service agents  pimps or job interviewers  make him a person too goofy to be the hero  and too pathetic to be the classic villain  however  most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen  but despite anything  average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis  his crusade against  scum  is something that average person wants  but doesnt have a stomachlack of brains to do it  while de niros travis might come in and out of particular times and places  other persons that appear in the film  mostly played by the character actors  give it distinctively 1970s feel  wizzard  played by peter boyle  presents the only link with americas better past  but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he  knows stuff   his obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade  other characters  on the other hand  show the bad side of new age  matthew  sport   keitel  who befriended reallife pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime  is dressed like a hippie  iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture  porno movies  that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom  are too much even for supposedly  liberated  betsy  even the politicians  like senator palantine  are lost in postvietnam and postwatergate mess  his broad and senseless  messages  that cover the lack of any serious program cant fool even such idiots like travis  the past is gone  the present is bad  and even the future seems bleak  and the feeling of pessimism cant be washed away even by ironic happy end  travis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation  and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schraders screenplay into the silver screen  new york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth  and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal  almost stygian atmosphere  another important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman  whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture  one of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was  same as his protagonist  famous for the wrong reason  instead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits  for many years it was tabloidfodder because of hinckley and his reallife reenactment of events in the movie  now  more than two decades later  when some other  life imitating art  incidents get more attention  we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory  
0	warner brothers has scored another marketing coup  the onetwo punch was started in the summer  with the release of batman forever  trailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat  ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel  carrey went on to win raves as the riddler and the everwise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video  11  99 at walmart   a mere two weeks before carreys return in this marketwise  but misfired comedy  ace ventura  when nature calls is a painful reminder of just how grating the rubberfaced comic can be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment  he may have been brilliant under the direction of joel schumacher  in batman forever  but  here  left to his own devices  carrey quickly wears out his welcome  the opening sequence is by far the bestan amusing spoof of cliffhanger  with ace performing a mountain rescue of a stranded raccoon    you can guess what happens to mr  paws  hint  it sounds like splat   the plot quickly shifts to a temple in the himalayas  and then to notsodarkest africa  where ace is on the case of a missing white bat  with his hair and limbs both wildly askew  carrey flies through his routine in about thirty minutes  the rest of the film is just more of the same  sure  the plots linear  and the production values solid  but where is the scripted humor to support carreys sloppy slathering  writer and director steve oderkerk provides precious few setups  instead  carrey just mugs away  playing for the camera even when most of it isnt funny  the better gags have been shown in the ads  though a bit with ace emerging bucknaked from the backside of a mechanical rhino is something to see  though an arguable improvement over the original  ace ventura  when nature calls is still a snooze for anyone over the age of ten  the script is virtually devoid of wit  tribal mask jokes  jerry lewis cameos  forget it  if anything  the inexplicable presence of simon callow  four weddings and a funeral  and bob gunton  the shawshank redemption  suggests that working with carrey is the classical actors ultimate challenge  just how long  can  they keep a straight face  
0	this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset  the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st  elsewhere for several years  and i had understood that the directorscreenwriter had written for the show on occasion also  i am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations  nor were they satisfactory  if i had to list a reason why     but that would be getting ahead of myself  besides  its not immediately clear  as there are so many problems with the film  adam arkin plays a gradeschool teacher who is sardonic  cynical  and somewhat abrasive  but a good teacher  he spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court  one day  he meets a drifter  david morse  who plays jack morrison on st  elsewhere  in the park  and inveigles him in a game of oneonone basketball  morse turns out to be good  and a friendship slowly develops between the two  as their respective professions progress on the screenarkins teaching  and morses selling of paper flowers to passing motorists  so far  my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue  and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack  good music to be sure  but it doesnt replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the storyit makes the film somewhat minimalistic  a technique i rarely admire  suddenly their friendship is interrupted by morses introduction to a fellow teacher of arkins  a woman arkin has long admired from afar  but it too reticent to approach  it appears that she begins to admire morse  who enjoys here attentions  but isnt sure what to do about itshe doesnt realize that he is a drifter  and knows nothing about his past   and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else  until then  i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film  the conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a fullfledged failure  the woman  at least to me  appeared to be fairly shallow  i didnt realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin  where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse  somehow  this is made to appear as if it is arkins fault  and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that hes gotten such a find of girlfriend  frankly  dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make  punching her in the mouth not the least  after this  the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural  if i had to summarize a major gripe  its that this is a story spread too thin  that creates semilikable characters at the outset  and then suddenly jerks them into being 16yearolds at the last moment  it might be truetolife with some people  but that doesnt mean  i  have to like it  i dont    avoid  
1	wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day  provided  of course  that youre the victim of a frontal lobotomy  there is  in fact  no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at  moviegoers in their late teens and early twenties  the most lucrative target group  this is film noir for the mtv generation  fastpaced  slick  flashy  gleefully mindless  and hollow to the core  wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998  ive seen more convincing drama  with nearly as much bare flesh  on that pinnacle of narrative quality  baywatch  wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking its a thriller with a real story  what it is  however  is a series of increasingly improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists  everything in between those serpentine moments is filler  a flash of a breast  a spatter of blood  and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie  the film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess  just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen  and that will probably be it  using this approach  i was right three times and wrong only once  thats not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about whats around the next corner  the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie  the hot  young cast and the old standby  sex  both have an abundance of screen time  although ill admit that the films erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected  nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu   the softcore sex sequences are generic  and dont generate much heat  the lesbian kisses cant hold a candle to those in bound  theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances  neve campbell  possessing an ironclad  no nudity  clause in her contract  keeps her clothes more or less on   the films greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower  maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fullyclothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick  mrs  kevin bacon  is familiar with  the director of wild things is john mcnaughton  whose last effort was the finelytuned psychological thriller  normal life  that movie featured copious sex  a pair of real characters  and a powerful script  its difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker  but i suppose we all need to put food on the table  mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here  in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success  his previous widerelease picture  mad dog and glory  was a boxoffice disappointment   quick cuts and pretty sunrises cant even begin to cover up this movies flaws  the main character  and i use that term lightly  since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality  is sam lombardo  matt dillon   a guidance counselor at floridas blue bay high school  a student  the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan  denise richards   has a crush on him  one afternoon  she comes to his house to wash his car  and  when she leaves  her clothing is torn  after confessing to her mother  theresa russell  that she was raped  she goes to the police station  where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette  kevin bacon  and gloria perez  daphne rubinvega   they are skeptical about here claims until another girl  suzie toller  neve campbell   comes forward with a similar tale  meanwhile  sam  convinced that hes being set up  goes to a shyster lawyer  bill murray  for help  the acting in wild things isnt very good  but none of the principals have much to work with  this is definitely not a character based motion picture  not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a tripledigit i  q   but it doesnt bother to give any of the onscreen individuals even a hint of depth  the men and women populating the picture are there to look nice  but nothing more  matt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps  neve campbell gets to model the slutty look  denise richards strikes a fetching pose in a seethrough  onepiece bathing suit  and nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon  the only one whos even remotely interesting is bill murray  and he seems to think hes in comedy  not a thriller  maybe hes got the right idea   columbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the films ending  which prompts the question  which ending do they want kept secret  wild things has no less than three  one occurs during the end credits  so stay seated   all of which are jawdroppingly absurd  a feat that joe eszterhas  the writer of basic instinct and showgirls  would be impressed by  thanks to jeffrey kimballs polished  kinetic cinematography  wild things always looks great  and george s  clintons score keeps it pulsing and throbbing  but  no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is  this is still trash  and  like all garbage  it stinks

1	look  the new version of  psycho  came out and the world didnt end  i guess gus van sant really isnt the bringer of the apocalypse  unfortunately  though  that  psycho  didnt end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it  van sants controversial  retelling  of alfred hitchcocks classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere  even before it premiered   without benefit of an actual viewing  many have said that the film will  at best  suck  being an  almost  good critic  i waited until i actually saw it to decide that the film  at best  sucked  and that concludes the use of the word  suck  and  hopefully  the thoughts that i am a braindead orangutan   director gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it  shotforshot  using the same  exact script  with a few minor alterations   the inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary  even though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time  suspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original  sadly  that did not occur  it is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin  from the original  psycho   but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen  in moores case  the film would have been helped if  the x files  gillian anderson had been cast instead  especially since moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression  from the cold demeanor and expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence  moore is scully  mortensen  who i liked in  g  i  jane   opts to play sam loomis as a cowboyhick  which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point  sam has a twang and a cowboy hat  but thats about it  mortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory  anne heche  in the janet leigh role  does a few good things in her brief time on screen  at least her marion crane has a little life in her  which cant be said for most of the rest of the cast  the best work  though  comes from vince vaughn  as the demented mamas boy  norman bates  hes not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins  but he is effective both in being naughty and nice  the best part of the film is the dinner scene heche and vaughn  where they simply talk  there is some solid acting there  something that is not carried through the rest of the film  van sant has made a boring film  all the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 arent as eyecatching now  what passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they dont impress or excite  van sant  in what i assume is a grasp at originality  decided to put some streamofconsciousness images into a few famous scenes  was that a lamb in the middle of the road   these images  included with some questionable editing choices  took away from the scenes themselves and caused  at first  bewilderment and  later  laughter  definitely not hitchcocks intention  at least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmanns original famous and terrific score  if a film like  psycho  does not frighten  then whats the point  aside from norman  the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience  there are things van sant and company could have done to at least make their recreation interesting  in the end  however  the new  psycho  is a noble attempt  but  alas  a dismal failure  
1	renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jeanclaude van damme on the action stars 1997 pairing with dennis rodman  doubleteam  and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick  stylish  and somewhat diverting action timekiller  tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels  knockoff  but this time around  style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous  and at worst incomprehensible  nor hide a host of truly lousy performances  writer steven e  desouzas fairly straightforward plotline isnt as outre as doubleteams strange yarn involving a secret think tankprison  but it makes about as much sense  which is little  van damme plays marcus ray  a hong kongbased sales rep for a jeans company    who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchipsized bombs in hk product exports to the u  s  dolls  electronic equipment  and  yes  jeans  its all part of some type of ransom scheme  but all i remember isand i kid you notgraphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world  bombs detonating  and an hatwearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter        which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout knockoff  while all of van dammes films have its share of unintentional laughs  mostly due to the stiff acting  skills  of the physically agile van damme  knockoff delivers more than usual  though not as many as van dammes embarrassing directorial effort  1996s thequest   a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza   i smoked that badass like a roman candle   and  entrepreneurship  babycakes   standing out among my favorites  but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of knockoffs laughs  van damme is true to laughable form  perhaps even worse than usual  early scenes actually require him to make funny with costar rob schneider  improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcuss business partner   and the sight and sound of the stillheavilyaccented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way  even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug  paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneiders cia superior  and lela rochon  playing an investigator for the jeans company  spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode  in rochons defense  though  her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs  exquisite bone structure  and perky bosoms  the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage  tsui picks up where he left off visually in doubleteam  juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work  here  though  tsuis visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill  coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise  for each nifty trick tsui pulls off  such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices  there are others that are completely superfluous  this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context  for instance  one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box  as he puts his hand in  the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen  its undoubtedly an interesting visual  but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something  the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences  but surprisingly  those in knockoff leave much to be desired  tsui does what he can to make something of them  employing freeze frames  blurred motion  and unconventional camera angles  but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza  there isnt anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tigerland mine fight in doubleteam  let alone anything remotely close to tsuis legendary hong kong works  but thats a given going in   if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woos stateside success  he would do best to break free from van damme    before its too late  if he continues his involvement with bgrade movies such as knockoff  the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish    that is  if it hasnt already disappeared entirely after this fiasco  
0	the most amazing thing about paul coxs innocence is how unlike a movie it is  i mean that as the highest compliment  if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40yearold romance  id want to run and hide  the sex scenes would be handled as a farce  producers would shed 20 years off the characters ages  so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star  and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence  along with a charming romantic story  the australianbelgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable  the romance gets started when former musician andreas  charles  bud  tingwell   learns that his true love  claire  julia blake   lives nearby  they decide to catch up on old times  but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair  complicating matters is andreas frail health  and claires longtime husband  terry norris   who cant understand why hes suddenly become obsolete  in my mind  the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire  than the feelings of everyone involved  john  claires husband  endlessly questions what he did wrong  claire initially insists shes a grownup  but admittedly behaves like a child  a prospect that thrills and disappoints her  andreas  an agnostic  begins to question his fate  a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence  cox litters the movie with flashbacks  including the repeated vision of a roaring train  its a reminder of andreas and claires past love  as young lovers  they met by train   but as it recurs  we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed  a pall is cast on the whole affair  a master of the understated  cox strings together a series of memorable moments  in andreas dream sequence  amidst the roar of the train and conversations  we get the whole picture of andreas and claires love  we also get glimpses into john and claires relationship  during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward  claire admits to john about her indiscretion  telling more than any monologue could  all thats heard is the scraping of forks against plates  the characters are unlike anything ive seen  theyre people  so many times  movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky  or theyre reduced to comedic buffoons  ordinary people with a pile of emotions  claire and andreas arent sure what the next step is  they do want to be happy  which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what theyve known throughout their adult lives  bravo to cox  who wrote the script  for not making john a monster  so that claires affair is automatically justified  norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claires love difficult to accept  we feel for him  hes a decent man  sure  he may have become complacent  but he never expected this  especially now  with so much presented to the audience  its only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive  which it does  however  in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers  cox displays a skill and  lan isnt likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon  
1	mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla  his entrance  however  is a grand one  out from the trees he leaps  gargantuan and imposing  sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug  and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have  joe bellows at the poachers before him  angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars  during this scene  i turned to my friend and said   wow  thats some ape   joe is quite a gorilla  a big  digital gorilla  he runs around the fields  chasing cars and people  he picks things up and stares at them pensively  he breaks things on accident  because hes just too big to avoid clumsiness  joe  as a special effect  is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes  as a character  he doesnt quite register  and the story hes been put in is as limp as they come  the words  family entertainment  have never been a stamp of quality  but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart  the picture is a remake of the 1949 film  its mostly just about the big gorilla  but  strictly as a formality  the movie also has a few human characters  the main one is jill young  poor charlize theron  forced to waste her talent   a lover of gorillas  as a child  she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother  now  she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife  specifically  shes out to protect joe  a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood  soon  zoologist gregg ohara  bill paxton  discovers joe  he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser  rade sherbedgia   who just happens to be the same guy who killed jills mother  so  in an effort to save joe  jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve  where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers  in addition  the space is way too small for him  after all  he is a really big gorilla   and  to add to the complications  strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext  he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe   and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jills mother  jill  of course  doesnt recognize strasser  even though he did kill her mother  this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young  a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film  the movie isnt really offensive  it has some competent actors  a few nifty sets  and a lot of scenes with a big  digitized gorilla  but the story is really dumb  there arent any characters  and the film isnt satisfying on any level beyond its visuals  the movie also has bad dialogue  if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue  its only fair to quote some of it  but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like  joe isnt happy   and  joe isnt safe here     we need to get joe out of here     joe is way too big for that cage   i dont know if these phrases are word for word  but theyre close  as i said  the characters here are only present as a formality  they do little more than state the obvious  of  course  joe is too big for that cage   paxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them  sadly  mighty joe young wastes them both  there are a few clever moments  although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment   and  as i said  the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes  its certainly not a bad film for kids  i doubt joe will give them nightmares  but adults in the audience arent likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla  a big gorilla is only interesting for a little while  after that  something needs to be done with the big gorilla  nobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla

0	  battlefield earth  is the best comedy of the year  it has to be  the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider  bad movie syndrome struck me again  so after witnessing how much  battlefield earth  has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles  i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster firsthand  is it as bad as advertised  oh yes  very much so  the plot is incomprehensible  the acting is atrocious  the special effects are mediocre  the action is dull  the implausibilities are legion  the dialogue is cringeinducing  the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny  i dont even want to continue reviewing this movie  id like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible  but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory  so here it is  the premise is basically a ripoff of  planet of the apes   only minus the apes and philosophical discussion  and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo  the year is 3000  the psychlos have conquered earth  and the human population has been enslaved  only a handful of humans escaped to radiationrich areas to escape the aliens  they live out their lives in fear  one man  johnny goodboy  i know  i know  tyler  barry pepper   ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos  there he confronts the psychlo head of security  a big  ugly  klingonlooking creature called terl  john travolta   pressed into slavery  johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back  meanwhile  terl is faced with his own problems  he has recently learned that hes stuck living on earth  which he hates  for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big mans daughter  he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology  this is where the plot gets ridiculous       so the  mananimal  can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos cant go  terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself  of course  his plan doesnt work  so many things wrong with this movie  where to begin  how about with travolta  whose hollywood clout brought about this  the cinematic version of scientology guru l  ron hubbards scifi novel  early previews for  battlefield earth   with constant shots of a makeupladen travolta cackling like lex luthor  had me  and several audience members  remarking   what the hell is travolta thinking   the movie did nothing to stem such remarks  all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here  terl cackles after nearly every line  and so does every other psychlo  of course  this makes every scene hilariously overwrought  no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary  the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america  but ceos generally dont laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees     you were going to be promoted  but now youre not  fwahahahahahahahaha        its no big surprise terl loses to the humans  hes an idiot  he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book  he underestimates his enemies  assuming hell win just because hes smarter    he uses the word  leverage  like some sort of scientologist mantra   not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero  he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos language and technology    why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me   he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him  no wonder this guy never got his promotion  the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention  why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive  how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open  how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1  000 years  and how do all these previously braindead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly  theres a whole lot more to scratch ones head about in  battlefield earth   bring a scorecard to track the plot holes  director roger christian shoots  battlefield earth  in the most distracting way possible  tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason  all the characters appear to be standing on the walls  and its awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue  the action sequences are atrociously edited  every one turned into an endless slowmotion parade that drains all potential excitement  are these things really so hard to construct  my respect for supposed  lightweight  action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in  battlefield earth  how badly an action sequence can be shot  this movie is an absolute headache  its not just the shot selection and editing  the movie  quite frankly  makes no sense  for most of  battlefield earths  running time  i just didnt know what was happening  it didnt have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical  though they certainly are   i really had no idea what the hell was going on  when i pieced the plot together later  it didnt look any better  heres how much of a disaster this is   battlefield earth  is already the worst movie of the year  and its going to take something really  really inept to top it  the only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it  in fact  id think that hubbards cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible  thatll teach me to give into

0	its a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise  the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying  osmosis jones is crude  gross  disgusting  and was directed by the farrelly brothers  the twisted siblings behind theres something about mary  me  myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt  not that theres anything wrong with scatology  i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor  such as it was  its merely that with osmosis jones  the farrellys humor is too juvenile  too predictable  you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn  osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho  the trouble is  the animation may please the very young  but the jokes may be over their heads  while the teenage audience may find it too tame for their tastes  adults  well  lets just say most will find it unappetizing  osmosis jones plays like a 100minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby  the live action sequences revolve around frank  bill murray   who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe  he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower  frank  much to the consternation of his daughter  is a fastfood addict  eating anything  and everything  that can kill you  he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner  and presumably smell better  than he does  franks body is invaded by thrax  a lethal virus  after frank eats a hardboiled egg that had fallen to the ground  its not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth  nope  the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg  wresting it from the primates mouth  like i said  the gross meter tips the scales on this one  after ingesting the egg  the movie begins its animated sequences  here  osmosis jones  voiced by chris rock   a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix  voiced by frasiers david hyde pierce   a 12hour  painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax  smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne   basically  what we have is a cliched copbuddy movie  rife with all the clich  s of that genre  and this is why osmosis jones doesnt click  it merely falls back on tired  familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations  the jokes and puns are lame  osmosis searches out a snitch  a former flu virus  after pumping him for information  drix tells osmosis   funny  he doesnt look fluish   and the jokes dont rise above that level  the live action scenes are no better  frank is such a slob  so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child  hes almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters  osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left  the animation is rather twodimensional and flat  it lacks scope and depth  it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head  and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater  
1	it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system  no major surprise  when j  s  mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either  the americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist  the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority  small wonder that hollywoods most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individualunderdog against some larger collective oppressive  witness braveheart  born on the fourth of july  rocky  first blood  clear and present danger  jfk  the list goes on  theres little of that in singapore  we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line  though the governments been long worried about the younger people getting  americanised  and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition  the people vs  larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america  sex  does pornography have a right to exist and circulate  larry flynt  the publisher of hustler magazine  thinks so  and obviously so too the u  s  congress which last month threw out a bill to curb pornography on the net  but even with such actions  americans remain undecided  the oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire  what they have ignored is actually a great picture  woody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a tohellwithmorality  tohellwiththelaw  and tohellwiththesystem antichrist that we last saw in natural born killers  and he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his exstripper wife dearly  the latter is played with abandon  conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love  who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination  if not of the award itself  edward norton plays their jerky lawyer  the relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox  superficially they are immoral outcasts whove had it coming  woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down  and courtney dies of aids  gods damnation  but in the powerful love they have for each other  each standing by the other in turn  the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist and  in the american context  a christian  if they can love and care  and feel just like anyone else on a personal level  friedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself of all moralchristian influences  to go beyond good and evil  this is a great picture  no doubt  and i love it personally  because it is moving  funny  ends with open american optimism blah blah  but i like it and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions  and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases  there are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities  this movie is not so much about larry flynt  but about americans and american society

0	under any other circumstances  i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review  however  in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful  a minute dissection of the ending is necessary  even though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes  do proceed at your own risk  the movie opens  quite poorly  i might add  as child psychologist malcolm crowe  bruce willis  looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene  and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolms past patients  distraught  the suicidal man  a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg  shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself  cut to the  next fall   as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case  a trouble young man named cole  haley joel osment  one of the only child actors in a while i didnt want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument   after about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences  we learn that cole has  the sixth sense   the gift of being able to communicate with the dead  and this  as they say  is where the healing begins  the sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film  one of roger eberts colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of  siskel and ebert    although i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons  i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise  ive always been a sucker for surprise endings  my favorite movie is the usual suspects  and rarely dislike a film that sports one  here  since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the films conclusion  the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending  something ive fallen victim to in the past  was eliminated  and indeed  my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment  stripped of the element of surprise  the film was put to the task of showing what it really had  instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion  after seeing its true colors  i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is  despite what the many champions of the movie may say  void of any real power  its a neat concept  but not one that justifies being made into a featurelength movie  in fact  the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earthshattering revelation that is yet to come  and when the final moments do come  its a huge letdown  the end makes no sense at all  it stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level  i wont go into any details  but suffice to say that  as far as i can tell  it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder  now  in all fairness  i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending  however stupid it may be  had it not been revealed to me before hand  however  i feel very confident that i  as well as anyone who had seen a few  twilight zone  episodes  would have seen it coming a mile away  the fact that moviegoers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped  ironically  to fully appreciate the best scene  that of cole and malcolm attending a little girls funeral   the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy  i wouldnt have even known about this mental disease if i hadnt  by pure dumb luck  caught  dateline nbc  the other week when they did a feature story on it  despite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment  where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace    in the end  the sixth sense is too chalkfull of contradictions and just isnt plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation  
1	the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by films end  if youre not familiar with this law  then maybe youve seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by films end  now if youre a regular reader of mine  youve heard me say this countless times  you know how drive me crazy is going to end  but is the journey to get to that ending worth it  no  it definitely is not  melissa joan hart  from abcs  sabrina  the teenage witch   likes a hunky stud on the basketball team  adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor whos just broken up with his activist girlfriend  apparently he wants to make his exgirlfriend jealous enough to take him back  and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance  so the two pretend to date for some reason  but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud  will grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends  will this crazy scheme work  do i care  the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy  what makes movies like cant hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work  and to a lesser extent  shes all that and never been kissed  is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly  i dont know what the writers intention was with drive me crazy  there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to  here theres nothing    just teens whining about whos going to take them to the big dance  do me a favor kids  go get a job or something    just shut the hell up  in all honesty  the best part of this film is the end credits  now normally when i say that its followed with the joke     because the movie is finally over   in this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film  after the obligatory second playing of britney spears titular song  theres a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school  nothing great  but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them  scifi fans take note  there are brief appearances from stephen collins  star trek  the motion picture  and faye grant  the tv miniseries  v  and  v  the final battle    pg13 
0	i remember making a pact  right after patch adams  to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality  but darn it  music of the heart is just layered with feelgood material and bright characterizations  its hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with its manipulation  in addition  its also a terrific family film  this is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari  who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools  it could also be described as mrs  streeps opus  yes  meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari  and that brings both good news and bad  out of the gate  possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing  it is relatively difficult to identify with robertas character and grasp her academic pointofview  she is very strict with her students  but what insight does that create into the story  slowly but surely  we begin to recognize the intentions of the character  and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied  one thoroughly interesting fact about music of the heart lies with the unlikely presence in the directors chair  horror veteran wes craven  after leaving an impression with the scream films and the original nightmare on elm street  craven has attempted a precarious crossover to drama  at first  his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious  but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material  it doesnt carry the heartwarming courage of mr  hollands opus  but music of the heart is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth  the tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate  yes  oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep  but its the solid ensemble cast that makes music of the heart work  angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams  the principal at an inner city school who initially doesnt hire roberta because of her lack of experience  blueeyed adian quinn is endearing  as always  playing a new love interest  gloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive secondgrade teacher  and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force  its like a schoolteachers version of thelma and louise  in a restrained but effective manner  the movie tackles more issues than just guasparis teaching of violin  theres some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons  who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman  in its dramatic buildup  the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth  its a good movie for anyone to see  although missing out on the experience would not be a lifealtering decision  its commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult crossover  and also for achieving his intricate goal  watching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments  who may ask yourself  this is the guy who directed scream  of course  when the third installment of that series comes around in february 2000  with craven directing   you may find yourself wondering  this is the guy who directed music of the heart  mission accomplished  wes  thankfully  there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film  in its entirety  its a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family  despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile  the child actors are cute and perform up to par  even if some of their problems are clich  d and predictable in the extreme  the mother who doesnt want her son to be learning white mans music  the unexpected casuality    basically everything is there  it doesnt strike the perfect chord  but music of the heart is highly convincing  the uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better  but music of the heart is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals  
0	roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast   who would have guessed that the most savage maddog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by    ben kingsley   my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark  henry fonda in once upon a time in the west  or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it  they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild  sympathetic  or even ineffectual character roles  the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious  that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast  gary  gal  dove  played by ray winstone  has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain  life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing  but his paradise is about to be shattered by a onetwopunch  the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa  the second punch comes from gals past  back in london gang boss teddy bass  ian mcshane  tvs lovejoy  is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal  he sends his most rabid henchman don logan  ben kingsley  to fetch gal  don will accept any decision gal makes from  yes  to  certainly   however  if gal says  no  don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guys exporn star wife deedee  amanda redman   in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybodys skin  kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness  there are some serious problems in louis melliss and david scintos script that should have been caught before filming  when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success  beyond an ability to use skindiving gear  no special talents are required of him  any local hood could have done what gal is needed for  additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault  flooding the vault  no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether  but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool  in spite of the provocative title  the story is cliched and overly familiar  i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade  the story is usually of the reformed outlaw  a robert taylor type  who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability  the old gang  however  wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git  im  it is not a great plot  in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards  perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film  it is an old plot dressed up to look new  if the plot is old  at least the style is creative  this is director jonathan glazers first film  but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout  his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences  cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes  we see one side of a persons faces  but the other side fades into the darkness  a sort of metaphor for the halfworld these characters inhabit  half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden  us yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog  at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking  the heavy accents  and the cockney language  sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre  the london crime film  the plot may be new to british crime films  but it would be overly familiar as a western  further respectability comes from ben kingsleys highpowered performance  i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale  
1	the long kiss goodnight  r  meryl streep tried it and failed  even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her wellbared assets  however  geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight  a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband  renny harlin  davis plays samantha caine  a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years  with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey  samuel l  jackson   she slowly remembersand reclaimsher past as charly baltimore  toughasnails cia operative  needless to say  with the reappearance of samanthacharly comes the appearance of an assortment of nogoodniks out to erase more than her memory  shane black netted a cool 4 mil for his script  im not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag  but for what its worth  it delivers the goods  like blacks previous work  such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout  the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny  quirky dialogue  the humor especially works well in this case  for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously  but theres no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell  who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car    while ice skating  jackson and davis make a good team  jackson is funny as ever as ever  in fact  his spirited line deliveries  especially when he first appears  are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction  as good as he is  the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis  who shows much promise as an action heroine  what makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesnt take herself too seriously  she is obviously in on the joke  slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation  this is not to say that she doesnt need worksometimes she lays on the  toughness  a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature  but should the public embrace the film and  in turn  the notion of a kickass female  davis could have found her special niche  it seems as if davis and harlins first collaboration  the middling pirate epic cutthroat island  was just a dress rehearsal  albeit a very costly one  for long kiss  in which the wifehusband team hit their action stride  anyone simply looking for a fun  escapist entertainment that requires littletono thinking will find this film to be a morethanwelcome kiss  
1	in my reviews i try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see  i realize that we all have different tastes and i cannot predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike  but in the case of american beauty  i must make an exception  if you havent yet seen it  go see it  now  stop reading this review and head for your local multiplex  then after youve seen it  come back  ill wait here  welcome back  if you followed my advice  and i see no reason why you should not have  do you    im sure youve just had one of the richest cinematic experiences of your life  american beauty is an extraordinary film  a powerful  jolting exploration of the dark side of the american dream  its humorous but it isnt funny because of the unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs throughout the whole production  mixing comedy and the darkest of drama was the way this film was intended  and by god  it works  making it one of the years very best  lester burnham  kevin spacey  has entered the mother of all midlife crises  he is living life without a purpose  he is bored  depressed and sick of his sheltered  insignificant existence  he barely ever talks to his family  has no sex life  is stuck at a deadend job and thinks he has no reason to live  but one day  when he and his equally troubled wife  annette bening  attend one of his daughters  thora birch  cheerleading performances  he sees something that makes him come alive  what he sees is the performance by his daughters friend  the head cheerleader  he develops a lust for the promiscuous young girl  an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature  but for the first time  lester feels that he is actually living  this crush is only the beginning  lester proceeds to make more and more radical changes in his life  buying the car of his dreams  cursing off the boss and quitting his job   today i quit my job  told the boss to f    himself and blackmailed him for 60  000  would you pass the asparagus please     buying drugs from the voyeurnextdoor  ricky fitts  a teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he considers to be  beauty   and refusing to be docile in family affairs  his new attitude further alienates his daughter  only reassuring her that her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers that be  and inspiring her to enter a relationship with her eccentric neighbor  and the burnhamss neighbors provide american beauty with a significant chunk of its dramatic momentum  ricky fitts  wes bentley  serves as the films thematic center  providing the obscure  powerful meaning of the title  colonel fitts  the father  is one of the most fascinating and complex characters in the movie  even considering his limited screentime  kevin spacey has never been better  and this performance will certainly earn him a chance to put a little gold person on his mantel  he never plays his droll character as a freak  rather  he effectively portrays him as a normal person led to drastic selfexploration by his dissatisfaction with life  spacey is poignant and devastating in the role of a lifetime  equally astonishing is young thora birch  who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling and tenderness  at two hours and ten minutes  american beauty didnt feel nearly long enough  its a complicated  unforgettable film that  like the ice storm two years ago  dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life  powerfully and cynically  it dissects the notion of the pretty house with the white picket fence and appealing garden being the american dream  it claims that this pictureperfect image is just that  an image  and hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it  the dark  deeply ironic ending  though given away by our narrator in the first few minutes of the movie  stays with you for weeks after its all over  american beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs every now and then to counterbalance the mindless drivel we see released  even more so considering its a masterpiece  
1	m  i2  the sequel to mission impossible  is a james bond wannabe film  but it fails to even come close to that film in wit  humor  and entertainment value  it tries to be a spyromance movie  but without any suspense the film just looks like its an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses  it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human  the coolest thing about this movie  was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie  was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols  the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence  except for the choreographed action sequences  the film was dull for threequarters of its time  filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed  as for the action scenes  they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films  but their advertisement for sadistic responses  is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence  which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen  m  i2 opens and closes with fastpaced action scenes  but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue  the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus  at that point  the only thing that kept me awake  was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the films supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way  its a megabuck film adapted from a popular hightech gadgetry tv series  but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it  and it failed to produce a story that had any substance  john woo   broken arrow    faceoff   is good at doing car chases  choreographed fights with midair flips and kungfu kicks  slomo shots of two guns blazing  and of fire explosions  but he just cant seem to handle dialogue and suspense  the star of the film and coproducer  tom cruise  and his romantic interest  thandie newton  are miscast  cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile  as he tries to carry off this macho role  while thandie is not an actionfilm girl  and seems like a fish outofwater in this one  their romance didnt work  not only was it tepid and not sexy  but it wasnt convincing  the film opens with dizzying speed  perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success  we will be in three different locations instantaneously  sydney  the american southwest  and seville  first  we are in sydney  australia  where a scientist with a muffled russian accent  dr  nekhorvich  rade   mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it  he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain  which explains the films mythic theme    as we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil  the one who played the villain  dougray scott  does so in a onedimensional gruff tone  which did not distinguish him in that role  at least  if the film got the villain part right  it might have had some fun with this nonsense  soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri  but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains  before they crash the plane and parachute out of it  the one who was posing as dimitri  turns out to be sean ambrose  scott   a rogue member of the imf  which is a cialike clone  he steals the package with the antidote  peels off a latex mask  which is a replica of the hero of the story  ethan hunt  cruise   who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust  sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices  we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in faceoff and in the original mission impossible  which as convoluted a plot as that film had  it was still a superior film to this sequel  woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground  as it is used so often in this film by both sides  so much so  that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain  it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character  which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense  next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest  and ethan is on vacation  hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool  when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard  delivers via a rocket launcher  a pair of talking sunglasses  hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help  billy baird  john polson  and luther stickell  ving rhames   with luther running a highgadget computer  but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall  thandie  to join his team  he is told  as an incentive to recruit her  all her criminal charges will be dropped  hopkins then signs off with the tag line  this message will selfdestruct in five seconds  actually  with the departure of hopkins  it was this disposable film that actually selfdestructed at this point  in seville  hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase  where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road  he also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal  and learns that she is valuable because her exboyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f  ck her  the imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f  ck him  as she leads them to his hideout in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort  the south african  hugh stamp  richard roxburgh   robert towne  the screenwriter  who contributed to the first  mission   who is noted for doing  chinatown   writes a colorless  pedestrian script  one that fails even to be funny in a camp way  the terrorists  who aim to rule the world  are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options  as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote  insuring that they will make billions on the stock  ethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah  with his only conflict being who is more important to save first  ethan does this rescue against all odds  as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company  fight it out with sean and the other terrorists  and rescue nyah  who injected herself with the virus to hinder seans getting it  as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle  ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle  using kickboxing  winning a shootout  throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists  making some more use out of that peeling mask bit  and by being completely fearless and larger than life  while he kicks everyones ass  if i was only entertained by this    i could have lived with it  but this film was so badly made  that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game  seeing only the slamdunks  but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast  in any case  this is a criticproof film  and will in all probability do well in the box office  as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into

1	written by alex cox  tod davies  terry gilliam and tony grisoni directed by terry gilliam ive always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid  dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded  you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are  no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat  and no idea how long the ride will last  then theres the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychninelaced dose  mushrooms  on the other hand  offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel  a steady  reassuring assent  a short period of thrilling motion and color  and then a smooth landing  acid is for daredevils  mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy  my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas  director terry gilliam has made an acid movie  when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie  full of shocking sight gags  aggressive images and grotesque comic performances  the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s  thompsons book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological worldview from the inside out  but for those of us who just want to enjoy a wellmade film  gilliam has produced a mixed bag  fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how selfprofessed  gonzo  journalist hunter s  thompson  johnny depp  and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta  benicio del toro   came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorneys convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971  operating under the pseudonyms of  raoul duke  and  dr  gonzo   the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender  then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite  cocaine  tequila and a rainbow of multicolored uppers and downers  they terrorize every one they meet  mostly because every one they meet terrifies them  duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town  then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge  dr  gonzo becomes enamored of a thickbladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplanes  white rabbit  reaches its climax  and these guys dont just trash hotel rooms  they rape them  humiliate them and leave them for dead  that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence  depending on your point of view  thompsons book  besides being a hilarious read  has stood the test of time as an important historical document  it simultaneously exposed the 60s drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die  pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompsons message  but the truth is that  stripped to its bare essentials  what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy  its a cheech and chong movie  youre there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results  see johnny take drugs  see johnny fall down  theres nothing wrong with this concept  but gilliam tries too hard  this is a frantic movie  all sweaty closeups  wideangle lenses  dutch tilts and otherworldly lighting schemes  there are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen  but to what end  much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompsons book  and there are some priceless comic observations  but youre hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work  this brings us to the performances  which strike me as all wrong  depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c  scott in patton  a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompsons dialogue  in between his several puking scenes  del toro fares better as dr  gonzo  but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost  watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago  with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads  now that would have been something to see  its interesting to note that alex cox  credited as a cowriter on the screenplay  was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over  as much of a fan as i am of gilliams work  cox would have been the better choice  sid and nancy  coxs best work  covered essentially the same subject matter  but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film  gilliam commits the compound sin of overdirecting his film while being uncertain of his purpose  what kind of movie was he trying to make  anyway  it doesnt try to be a cautionary tale  and it doesnt work as broad comedy  if he had considered more carefully his purpose  the result would have been a much more interesting film  but i dont want to be too hard on it  there are some truly funny moments  and if youre in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it  i do  however  recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance  i guarantee it will enhance the effect

0	only a year after the initial release of  scream   the horror sendup from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre  the inevitable sequel  scream 2  has arrived in our theaters  while the tongueincheek  parodic element is still noticeable in this film  its really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story  the first film  while often violent and gruesome  was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant  the premise of  scream 2  is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called  stab   based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers  courtney cox  about the events in  scream   is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening  i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy  its conclusion  in which a bleeding  wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think its a publicity stunt  is more surreal and disturbing than anything else  the satire in  scream 2  thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general  although resident horror film geek randy  jamie kennedy  is back with fresh dialogue about sequels  and  interestingly enough  how they are usually inferior to their predecessors   the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well  everything from  friends  and  saved by the bell  to  showgirls  and  terminator 2  is referenced here  horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning  and there arent any  wes carpenter  jokes this time  more importantly  this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film  the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from  scream   in fact  the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense   weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety  and one man seems willing to save the heroines life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show  understandably   scream 2  does not go so far as to actually blame the movies  but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted  couple that with the fact that several of the characters  most notably the lead character sidney prescott  neve campbell   are fairly welldeveloped and that there are some genuine moments of spinechilling suspense  and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right  we dont just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore  we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered  and  in one case  a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust  and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner  while i have not seen any of his other work  its easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated  slasher film  director  as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing  unfortunately   scream 2  occasionally reverts to the timehonored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window  for example  several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later  there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick  but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion  there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that  s  he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction  as for the question of whether or not  scream 2  is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor      well  its hard to say  i gave the first  scream  3 12 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a lighthearted sendup    scream 2  bounces all over the place stylistically  but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment  im not sure which is the better movie  but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing  sequels  however much randy might argue  do not necessarily suck

1	and i thought  stigmata  would be the worst religiouslyoriented thriller released this year  turns out i was wrong  because while  stigmata  was merely boring and selfimportant   end of days  is completely inept on all fronts  its a silly  incomprehensible  endlessly stupid mess  for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best  its extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up  for the first time in recent memory  an arnold action movie  and  batman  robin  doesnt count  is no fun at all    end of days  is a major stinker  the movie opens in vatican city  1979  some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy  which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation  if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31  1999  the world will be destroyed  the pope orders protection of this girl  though some priests believe she ought to be killed  in new york  that very night  a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy  twenty years later  we meet jericho cane  schwarzenegger   a suicidal excop with a drinking problem  now working as a security guard for hire  he is protecting a local businessman  gabriel byrne   who is actually possessed by the devil  an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after  christine york  robin tunney   recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine  including ownership of the same music box  apparently   jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her  there are so many problems with this film its hard to know where to begin  but how about starting with the concept  casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with  schwarzenegger is a persona  not an actor  so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea  arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions  in other words  trying to give him dimension was a mistake  harrison ford  mel gibson  or even bruce willis could have played this role  theyve all played noble and flawed heroes   but not schwarzenegger  there are several scenes that attempt to establish jerichos character  one has him contemplating suicide  another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter  and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christines location by offering him his old life back  none of these scenes really work  because arnie isnt up to the task  the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong  confident character  like the terminator  for example   the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before  this one isnt at all believable the way arnold plays him  the supporting cast tries their hardest  and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all  as the prince of darkness  hes suave and confident  he acts like one would expect the devil to act  the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense  more on that later  and that undermines him as a powerful villain  byrne outperforms arnold in every scene they have together  including the aforementioned temptation bit   but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable  root for the devil  byrnes speech about the bible being  overrated  actually starts to make sense  mainly because arnolds attempts at refuting it  mostly of the  tis not   variety  are feeble at best  the only problem is  arnold has to win  so in the end  nobody really cares  kevin pollack plays jerichos security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides  but like most bad action movie sidekicks  he disappears after about an hour  robin tunney isnt given much to do except look scared  in fact  all of the supporting players are good actors  but none  save for byrne  is given anything interesting to do  performances aside  it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it  this being an action blockbuster  its no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script  which starts off totally confusing  and when some of it is explained  and not much of it is   its utterly ridiculous  why is the devil coming on new years eve  1999  because its exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil  which isnt 666  it turns out  some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down  so the real year is 999  so just add a 1 to the beginning  and youve got 1999  if you dont buy this explanation  youre not alone  its convoluted and silly at the same time  the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous  shes christine  see  and she lives in new york  see        and if that werent bad enough  theres plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isnt explained at all  why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street  but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk excop  hes powerless  is he impervious to only one kind of bullet  how come he cant control jericho or christine  and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies  a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this  but its never actually explained  usually  this sort of thing wouldnt matter in a schwarzenegger flick  i mean  dont get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies   but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting  there are several predictable horror film clich  s present in  end of days   complete with the old  black cat hiding in a cabinet  bit  not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there  it gets so formulaic that its possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a  boo  will come  their predictions will rarely be wrong  the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless  partially because we dont care about these characters  due to the scripts pathetic attempts at characterization and setup   and also because they  too  dont make any sense  theres a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady  its good for a few chuckles  but not much else  supposedly were to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan  but the script never sets that up  so the scene is merely silly  none of this is terribly exciting  because all the action sequences are so badly framed that its often hard to tell why its happening in the first place  not to mention that theyre edited in fullon incomprehensible mtv quickcut style  most of them had me scratching my head  rather than saying   wow  cool     end of days  is not only silly and confusing  but its also distinctly unpleasant to watch  the devil apparently doesnt operate in the more subtle  illconvincepeopletokilleachother fashion outlined in the bible  but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight  this doesnt only make him an awfully predictable sort  but it also means that not a single scene in  end of days  goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence  or the odd kinky sexual encounter  yet another bit that had me scratching my head   if violence is supposed to be shocking  its not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb  scenes arent connected through any reasonable means  so a lot of the time  stuff gets blown up  or people get killed  and i had no idea why  reasons  to hell with reasons  lets just blow stuff up  isnt it cool  nope  not by a long shot  this film is thoroughly unwatchable  its dull  interminable  and unrelenting in its stupidity  perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career  because its not happening with hack peter hyams here    end of days  might have had camp value  if only it didnt top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobodys going to buy  if the movie is going to be serious  the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script  if its going to be campy  arnold shouldnt be taking himself so damn seriously  i didnt actually see him put up on a cross  did i    and his character shouldnt be such a sad sack  as it stands   end of days  is just a bad movie  and an awfully gloomy one at that  
0	burnt money is the perfect festival film  it will show once or twice  and then no one  thankfully  will ever have to hear from it again  this film from the seattle international film festival 2001s emerging masters series is easily one of the years worst  billed as a gay bonnie and clyde  this gritty film from director marcelo pi  eyro has its only highlight in a welldesigned title sequence  two gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader  whose plan they screwed up  angry  this causes the gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys  one of whom may not actually be gay  hiding out in a prostitutes apartment  the two men must fight off police and gang members in a very long showdown for the movies conclusion  if caught  they risk losing all the money  and their love  as an added emotional bonus  one of the gay men is dying  or something like that  everything that happens is so quick and confusing i was completely lost  clarity isnt exactly this movies striving virtue  so it was a little hard to pick up  not much could have really happened though  the main events in this long twohour film are explicit homosexual and heterosexual sex  graphic drug use  extreme violence  and strong language  lots of explicit material is never a bad thing when theres a reason  but theres no purpose to anything in this film  most of the sex and violence scenes come off as silly  while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous and depressing  it appears pi  eyro  who cowrote with marcelo figueras  from a novel by ricardo piglia  purposefully adds more blood and lovemaking for his own amusement  he makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible  makes them snort cocaine  gives them guns and condoms  and lets them go  burnt money is pointless  the performances are bad  it tries to thrill and shock  but only causes boredom  god forbid it will ever get a distributor  another disappointing film from this years socalled emerging masters series  pass on by

0	plot  a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention  the boys eventually get together to split the money  but as plans change  doublecrosses occur  dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road  whos on the up and up  whos the real bad guy and whos gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie  critique  the funnest movie that ive seen so far this year  its got style  its got tough guys talkin shite and its got plenty of bullets to go around  a definite hunkahunka burnin adventure  a guys guy movie through and through  and one thatll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff  its not very original  it goes on for a little too long  but costner and russell make it happen  as two shitekickin elvis lovers  who dont stop till they  more or less  drop  this movies got some pretty intensive shootout scenes  one of the coolest robbery scenarios that ive ever witnessed  featuring several elvises with guns a blazin and the kings music playing in the background  and a decent helping of doublecrosses  sharp dialogue and funny moments  in fact  even though the cast is filled with many name actors  bactors as they might be for the most part   most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim  but the true glue that holds this film together  other than the spirit of elvis himself  is costner and russell  who play their badass characters to the t  sure  russells been down this road before  but costner surprised me with his nastiness  i guess hes pissed at all the boxoffice bombs that hes been in of late  but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here  in the end  the bottom line with this movie is having fun  kickin ass and making sure theres enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards  and smoke em if you got em  folks  there is also this one really great showdown scene between costner and a cop  thatll have you crackin up and lovin it all at the same time  the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack thatll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next  it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background  with plenty  and i mean plenty  of camera tricks  cuts and edits  but for this kind of flick  it actually works  the film is not perfect though  it starts off with a pretty big bang  but then pulls a way of the gun on us  and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle  while characters intermingle and disperse  i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots  and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well  and did i mention that courteney cox looked megahot in the movie  no    okay  well i just did  i coulda done without her whole  romance  angle  but to be honest  it doesnt take up much of the film  which is generally covered in blood  explosions  guts and elvis nods  try to see how many  inside  connections to the king you can guess  of course  its no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind  i also like these types of  guy  movies a lot  and even though the film doesnt bring much originality to the table  it does offer a pretty coherent story  some nice twists and turns  humor and a big ol helping of whoopass coming straight from costner and russells respective boots  probably not a film for everyone  but definitely for those who enjoy the guns  the charismatic bad guys and a fun  if entirely disposable  adventure  now see how many elvis songs ive used to pun my way through this phony review below  the elvis songs also recommend this movie  so whether youre lonesome tonight or any other night  remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets  leave your little sister at home  bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse  cause this movie aint one to return to the sender  i really beg of you  whether youre stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel  to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender  and no suspicious minds either  folks  cause i got stung by this movie  i mean it really shook me up  and unless youre the devil in disguise himself  i think you wont be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either  so dont be cruel  dont turn away  dont curl up with your latest flame tonite  whether she be a hardheaded woman or not  and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film  its now or never  folks  trust me  i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that id seen so far this year is far behind me  joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building  thank you    thank you very much   wheres joblo coming from  get carter  710   heat  810   honeymoon in vegas  910   payback  810   reindeer games  510

0	  seven  is one of the best mystery movies ive ever seen  its extremely intriguing and suspenseful  but its also quite fun  its a serial killer mystery  but you dont care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope they just catch the killer  the story is a copsonthetrailofserialkiller mystery  someone is murdering people who are offenders of  the seven deadly sins   a fat man  gluttony  was forced to eat himself to death  a lawyer  greed  is slaughtered by his own rich possessions    i could go on but revealing any more would give away entirely too much  what makes this film so unique is the characterization of the  good guys  which makes the unseen villain seem so vile  brad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills  the cocky rookie  however  morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset  the wise veteran on the verge of retirement  and he doesnt get killed by the end   there is a great sense of camaraderie here which often provides for a breath of comic relief  this is impressive because the mood is so tense  and the fact that it can be downplayed as well as it is here  let alone at all  is quite an accomplishment  the setting takes place in present day new york city but the art direction is able to give the city a feeling of the evil  scary place many believe it to be  the production design is superb  in the spirit of  batman  and  the crow   this film embodies the gothic mood  the way the words fade in and out  along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add a lot to the story on a subconscious level  even the credits are scary  the killers victims have no connections at all  and thus mills and sommerset dont have much to go on to solve the case  they can only wait for the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense  we become just as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of the unknown  not that many films have such an interesting and intriguing screenplay as this  the only problem i had with the film is the way in which mills and sommerset are lead to a suspect  lets just say it seems a little too  mystery movie   or too convenient in other words  when they are led to a suspect by the name of john doe  a terrific chase scene ensues  this is a typical thrilling element  but it works perfectly here because of the process of the story  if anything  this film is the epitome of twist endings  i dont have to tell you mills and sommerset finally catch the criminal  but the way in which this happens is surprising  there is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer and the detectives  and even though hes obviously insane  his charisma makes for some good points  whats even more surprising is the last few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terrific climax as the films resolution comes down to a question of what justice really is    seven  is not just a film about crime  but about the evil within man  john doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it of  scum   but as justified as he makes himself seem  we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals of justice  
1	the year is barely a week old  and there is already a candidate for the worst of 1997the relic  a wouldbe chiller thats more successful at making the audience laugh than scream  in this ridiculous film from uberhack peter hyams  whose last two pictures were dreadful jeanclaude van damme vehicles   a creature that feeds on the hypothalamuses  hypothalamii   of humans and animals goes on a killing spree in a chicago museum  how did this creature come into existence  and why does it feed on hormones  the  scientific  explanation cooked up by the fouryes  fourcredited screenwriters  amy holden jones  john raffo  rick jaffa  and amanda silver  takes  suspension of disbelief  to new heights  even by monster movie standards  but as cockamamie as the science is in the film  it isnt quite as hard to swallow as the casting of the clueless penelope ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics  miller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination  turning every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip  complete with piercing wails and glycerine tears  give it up  penelopeits a monstermovie  on the flip side  tom sizemore just phones in his performance as a police lieutenant  but his role is so thankless that its hard to imagine it being played any more effectively  its quite funny to see a film indulge  with the straightest of faces  in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well  and so recently  in scream  for example  in one early scene  a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night  ok  we all know whats coming  but as if we didnt need any more confirmation  he pulls out a joint and starts puffing away  everyone knows what happens to people who do drugs in a scary movie  and later  miller frantically runs out of a museum exhibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing  does she make a beeline for the front door  of course notshe runs into the ladies room and cowers in a stall  with all the cliches  it is only fitting the films climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in recent film  that of someone outrunning a fireball  if the relic is truly  the next evolution in terror  as the poster states  then the horror filmand humanityis in even worse shape than we thought  
0	note  after claiming otherwise  my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branaghs hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap  as it happens  it didnt take long   is there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli  known mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968s romeo and juliet  required viewing for many high schoolers  and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare   he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera  where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria  last year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre  one of the twin peaks  with wuthering heights  of romantic literature  it might seem peculiar  then  that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen  at first blush  hamlet is far removed from romance  the hero  though a prince  is depressed  conflicted and confused  the ostensible love interest gets little screen time  and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery  the plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus  it is zeffirellis genius  however  that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace  in this italian masters hands  romance is everywhere  in a sons worship of his father  in the bonds of deepest friendship  in the private thoughts of young lovers  even in the mystery of castles by the sea  after all  the story hinges on a ghost  and what could be more romantic than that  what seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all  namely  hiring thenreigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead  who could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and a  lethal weapon   in the series of the same name  would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the english language  franco zeffirelli  thats who  and it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money  what gibson brings to the role is a naturalness and ease which makes the whole story meaningful  not to mention comprehensible  his line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed  his movements and gestures  excepting his sometimes too active eyes  are totally in keeping with the character  this is a hamlet whose pain we feel  whose struggle we empathize with  and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at films end  glenn close  the other big name in the production  also does well by the script and satisfies as hamlets mother  gertrude  though i must confess im still trying to understand the character as written    zeffirellis incestuous interpretation of hamlets relationship with his mother doesnt help   alan bates makes a believably evil claudius without resorting to the mannerisms of a hollywood heavy  by and large the rest of the cast performs admirably and comfortably  of special note are the cinematography by david watkin and the score by ennio morricone  both support the realistic mood marvelously  as do the sets and costumes   without any overstated effects that declare  this is important  this is shakespeare   i particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all  the melody of a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due  perhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare  definitive   and there are certainly quite a few other filmed versions of hamlet that i have not seen  but if youve ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of the bard  this hamlet is an excellent place to start  
1	note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  be forewarned  the teaser trailers for my best friends wedding scarsely gave reason for hope  it looked like the sort of goofy  lighthearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight  but little more  id frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often  it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friends wedding was such a success  a strong  bouyant romanticcomedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects  featuring a triumphant performance from ms  roberts  the heroine of my best friends wedding is julianne potter  julia roberts   a successful new york restaurant critic  and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes  rupert everett  that years ago  she had made a pact with her dear best friend and exlover michael oneal  dermot mulroney   a sports writer  that if they both hadnt married by the time they reached 28  they had promised to marry each other  both julianne and michael are both single  of course  and when george inquires about michaels age  julianne realizes that hes mere weeks away from his 28th birthday  and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day  however  she finds herself even more distraught when michaels call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace  cameron diaz   and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding  julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael  and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary  the setup for my best friends wedding  then  is a fairly conventional one  and in many ways the films storyline is formulaic  but only to a certain extent  the film was directed by p  j  hogan  whose first feature  muriels wedding  had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting uglyduckling story  and the same holds true for my best friends wedding  which confidently combines traditional romanticcomedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour  the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr  hogan  for example  theres a heartfelt  emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film  with a trio of teenagers  inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks  harmonizing in the background  my best friends wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film  and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect  it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allens everyone says i love you  id even assert its a more successful one  my best friends wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well  in a typical romanticcomedy  kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty  conniving ice queen  and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps  this film is smarter than that  here  kimmy is sweet  sincere  and innocent  julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmys life  shed actually like her too  the george character is almost a staple of recent film  the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason  but in my best friends wedding  he gets to have a playful  mischievous and charming personality  throughout the film  the formulaisms one often sees is romanticcomedy are given little twists  and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion  there is a lot of smart writing in the wellpaced screenplay by ronald bass  were given four interesting  vivid  and likeable characters  with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments  my best friends wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts  who turns in a topnotch  confident and reassured performance as julianne  this isnt the sort of role one usually associates with ms  roberts  the julianne characters neurotic  fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role  but ms  roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here  remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience  if not entirely sympathetic  even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable  even better than ms  roberts though is cameron diaz  who turns in a shining performance in my best friends weddding  with a smile which lights up the screen  she effectively conveys kimmys insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner  and never hits a false note in the film  she even sings  i wont soon forget her charming serenade of  i just dont know what to do with myself   rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george  and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film  his george is a bit of a devilish rogue  entirely affable  and mr  everetts performance is a delight to watch  hes clearly having fun  and his joy is infectuous  dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role  unlike the other characters in the film  hes not given a lot to do  but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms  roberts and mr  mulroney  and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic  when julia roberts lustre began to fade  and she was usurped from her title as  americas sweetheart  by sandra bullock  i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile  while that didnt quite work out  its nearcertain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990  the romanticcomedy  will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game  my best friends wedding marks a return to form for ms  roberts  and cements p  j  hogans reputation as a skilled director of comedy

1	i have to admit that i disliked this film initially  it certianly isnt for every taste  and its sheer torture to sit through if youre in a restless mood  that said  if you are in the right mood  its absolutely incredible  this was my second favorite movie of 1998  and would have been a shooin for first in almost any other year  perhaps the big turnoff for many was this films unconventionality  id be hardpressed to compare it to any other film that ive seen  it is very  very artsy  incredibly slow  and amazingly  it works beautifully  on my second viewing  i realized that the film follows the three act structure  i didnt think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it   the first act serves to set up the characters  sort of  it exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness  and perhaps even feelings of boredom  and then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second  which encompasses most of the movie   the majority of the film is one extended battle scene  intercut with brief flashbacks and voiceovers  the artsier elements do not detract from the action  but add to it  they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers  only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes  the battle scenes are amazing  second only to  saving private ryan  in my opinion   theyre brutal  horrifying  and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography  the second act is as immersive  brilliant  and haunting as any film that i have ever seen  the only problems come during the first and third acts  malick takes a little too long to get the film started  although the initial scenes  which consist of two soldiers experiencing a nearedenlike paradise while going awol  and the preperations for battle  are effective and necessary  hints of pretentiousness sink in  the film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning  and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this  the final act is effective at winding the film down  but the problems from the first persist  its a bit too long  and comes over as pretentious at times  that said  there are two sequences  one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife  and another where one of the main characters is killed  that are nothing short of incredible  the performances are phenominal all around  the two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel  both of whom should have been nominated for oscars  nolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation  his character is hard  mean  and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men  and yet nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him  caviezel is forever questioning the nature of war  his place in it  and if theres any deeper meaning to the hell that hes going through  he is absolutely perfect  genuine  sympathetic  sincere  and yet strong when he needs to be  although restricted to a relatively small role  sean penn is also very good as the companys pessimistic seargent  as to how it stacks up to  saving private ryan   it was my second favorite movie of 1998   ryan  was my first  its really hard to compare the two  they are so  so different  so i wont  beyond saying that spielbergs film had more of an impact on me  however  the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality  i can easily see why someone would  the thin red line  above  ryan   i highly recommend both of them  and consider them to be the two best war movies ever made  all in all   the thin red line  is filmmaking of an incredibly high order  its slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of what is done right  its a real shame that it tanked at the box office  films this unconventional  powerful  and thoughtprovoking dont come along very often  
1	nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the winkandaconcussivenudge bombastorama con air  the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe  a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an illfated barroom brawl  the prison scenes are accompanied by voiceovers in which poe  in a languid southern drawl  describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met  if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity  it probably should  cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dimwitted and ridiculous  and that hes going to have to do something to keep himself entertained  and thus he slips into a familiar  surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings  cage plays cameron poe as a buffedup version of raising arizonas h  i  mcdonnough  cage should have known what he was getting himself into  he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock  and if theres one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production  even without his late partner don simpson   its that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the last bruckheimer production  the critical difference between the rock and con air is cages performance  in the rock  cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time  that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry selfawareness  while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home  cages goal is different but just as simple  to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact  audiences  too  should know what theyre getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production  in fact  the marketing people are counting on it  no one who loathed the rock for its sweargruntblast repetitiveness will be converted by con air  no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded  director simon west  yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwabs soda fountain  delivers exactly the kind of adrenalinetestosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture  its perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma  like insulin  con air does the work of a gland   what he doesnt deliver is a moment of suspense  a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcocks notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk  a really  really big desk and a really  really big bomb will serve the purpose nicely  if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension  they might have done something with con airs creepiest setup  at a desert stop for the planeload of convicts  serial killer garland greene  steve buscemi  wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool  their teteatete is eerie and menacing  providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains  danny trejo  ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them   in fact  con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement  too many characters  too much editing  too many dopey punch lines  too much of the cheap  ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts  it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance  while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack  as a u  s  marshal  goes for earnest  cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep  his recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape  his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies  it doesnt bode well for cages appearance in faceoff later this month  perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over  theres a word for people like you  nicolas  that word is called recidivist    repeat offender  
1	starring william baldwin  cindy crawford  steven berkoff all right  the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role  not that cindy does that bad  its just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindys extraordinary acting skills  but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation  and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty  but im sure that that is just a coincidence  no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet  well  thats just a happy coincidence  sure  william baldwin isnt a bad actor  unfortunately  he just doesnt demonstrate it at all in this movie  im not sure if thats because most of his lines were just so hokey  or if he was trying to make cindys acting look good  if it was the latter  it worked  cindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie  which is not to say that she doesnt have room for improvement  although to be fair to cindy  her lines were kinda cheesy in places  so right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford  arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet  chose for her foray into the world of cinema  well  im glad you asked that question  cindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents  why woud they target someone as likable as cindy  you ask  by the end of the movie you wont care  the story is so contrived it isnt funny  anyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house  without getting so much as a scratch i might add  she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin  whos character  max kilpatric  a police detective  seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine  my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagals early films   the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwins characters of the run from these killer russians isnt all that bad of an idea  its just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud  the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes  if i was baldwin  id hope this film disappears  as for crawford  she may indeed have some acting ability  unfortunately  any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad  this movie was obviously written with cindy in mind  since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks  its too bad they hadnt spent more time on a half decent plot  since ms  crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much  unless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you

1	my inner flag was at halfmast last year when nick at nite pulled  dragnet  reruns off the air  sure  id seen them all at least once  but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultraserious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv  even though  dragnet  is out of circulation at the moment  we webb antifans still have the d  i   a 50s propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous  blue boy  episode of  dragnet   for anyone like me who got laughs out of webbs rapidfire speeches and straightfaced seriousness  think of the d  i  as what would happen if sgt  joe friday ever enlisted  because he plays exactly the same character here  a nononsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long winded  melodramatic speeches on any topic  in this election year  im more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth  the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webbs office door and enters  he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up  the  produced and directed by jack webb  card pretty much goes without saying  this is his movie all the way  and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason  i was wondering if there would even be a plot  i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants  but the d  i  gives us more  much more  webbs mission is to make a man out of private owens  the local screwup  the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or  the captain will  personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself     whether the  lace panties  part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered   this  of course  gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens life a living hell  for those of you who havent been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching  heres a reprint of a typical monologue of his  i cant duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper  but the words should at least partially convey what im talking about      now you listen to me  youngster  someday youll wake up fighting on a beach and youll pray to god somebody doesnt get killed because of your foolishness    ive got a headline for you  every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours  youre gonna turn around and ill be standing right there   i couldnt write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d  i    nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame   but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines  like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard days work by going to the local bar  where he orders a tomato juice   he meets a woman who  coincidentally  also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typicallystimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his archrival  another marine d  i  webb marches over to the table  gets up in her face and says   just what kind of a dame do you think you are   bogart he aint  the other d  i  gets one of the few memorable nonwebb lines when he confesses to the girl   hes a damn good d  i      i guess im just a little jealous   join the club  were all jealous of jack webbs way with women  which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene  as webb finds his way to the womans place of employment  a lingerie store  and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display    you expect me to talk to you    in here    he exclaims  no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras  the woman goes off to help a customer  leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen  a little girl spots him in the store and demands   what are you doing in here    youre a man  arent you   he doesnt reply  but you know hes thinking in his head   what an odd species of human  so small  must be one of those children everyones been talking about   this poor girl  scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb  would later swear off the male gender entirely  just one of the many lesbian conversions hes responsible for  the movie doesnt focus too closely on webbs romance  it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie  where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills  after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea  webb asks owens   was that flea you killed a male or female   owens replies   a male  sir   webb yells to the platoon   this aint the one   that such a scene  along with the rest of the movie  was intended to be taken seriously defies comment  but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d  i   but for iwo jima  guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century  webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie  with the exception of owens  were played by actual marines  someone wanting to parody this movie couldnt do a more comical job than webb did  it makes it all the more ironic  like raeeyain on your wedding day  that the man had no sense of humor himself  theres a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter  webb bursts in the room and shouts   what did i tell you about laughing    to which the private replies   sir  only nineyearold girls laugh  sir   and let me tell you  i was as happy as a nineyear old girl while watching this movie  
0	one of the most blatantly obvious signs that oftenacclaimed director sidney lumets  gloria   a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film  had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre  suddenly  i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before  i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in  when a movie is over  arent we supposed to think about it for a while  and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with  i thought so  but  for one  i saw this particular picture by myself  and 2  even if i had been with someone there wouldnt have been anything to talk about in the first place  to be sure   gloria  begins with a stirring  rather poignant prologue in which a sevenyearold boys family is brutally gunned down by mobsters  in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it  right before the men broke in  of course  his father gave him the disc to escape with  eventually  the boy  named nicky nunez  jeanluke figueroa   is caught by the mobsters  and taken back to their apartment  meanwhile  gloria  sharon stone  has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didnt commit and returns to her exboyfriend  jeremy northam  to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime  when he refuses to give it to her  and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky  she leaves with him in order to save his life  but not before holding the men at gunpoint  stealing all of their money  and forcing them to strip nude  gloria is the type of fasttalking  smartmouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people  and she never expected to be stuck with a kid  but she has a heart of gold  dont they always in this type of movie  and is only trying to protect the boy  whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with  the previous incarnation of  gloria  by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands  remains unseen by me  but was no doubt superior  even though i cant really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one  regardless of the director or stars  there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original  but the film itself is simply lifeless  with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isnt completely unbearable to watch  i liked  for example  a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at  and keeps turning the car around  then driving a little ways  then slamming on the brakes and turning around again  these bright moments  however  appear long and far between  and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria  which is both painfully predictable and bythenumbers  throughout  my mind was repeatedly asking the question   who really cares   as gloria  sharon stone has adopted an overthetop brooklyn accent that honestly doesnt sound realistic at all  in the beginning  in fact  i was amazed at how amateurish stones performance was  but as the film progressed she got better  although not one of her better turns  stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored  jeanluke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag  all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted  none more than cathy moriarty  an entertaining actress in her own right  who is billed fourth and has all of one scene  as glorias friend whom she turns to for help  sony  the studio that released  gloria   obviously does not have any faith in the film  and i dont blame them  they declined to screen the picture for critics  which is never a good sign  particularly with the highprofile people involved  although how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is  just look at the spectacular  in dreams   which failed to even make the top 10 last week   i have a suspicion  gloria  is going to vanish from theaters faster than  ishtar   judging from the opening night 7  00 p  m  showing i saw it at  where there were about ten to fifteen people present  counting myself  although stone can be an impressive actress  just watch her in 1995s  casino  or 1996s  last dance  if you dont believe me  and sidney lumet can be a respectable director  there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of  gloria  was worth remaking or  for that matter  why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful

1	the working title for no looking back was long time  nothing new  and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture  even though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes  it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics  writerdirector edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline  the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasnt spent their life in seclusion  instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings  burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion  offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way  no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful  the most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide  and the sooner  the better  alas  thats not the case  and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio  and  to further depress audiences  burns has shot the entire film on cold  rainy days in a gray new york state beach town  peeks of sunshine are few and far between  no wonder the characters are all so miserable  first of all  we have charlie  burns   a generation x slacker who abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion  then spent some time bumming around in california before deciding to come home  that girlfriend is claudia  lauren holly   and  after picking up the pieces of her life following charlies departure  she has moved on  shacking up with one of charlies old school buddies  mike  jon bon jovi   the two have a comfortable relationship  but its apparent to even a blind person that theyre not right for each other  claudia years for some spice in her life  mike wants to settle down and have children  then charlie reenters the mix  so who  if anyone  will claudia end up with  who cares   no looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that were not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle  so what if no one finds happiness  these characters dont deserve it anyway  especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time  they arent real people  theyre a writers construct stumbling through a tooobvious storyline  they should know the ending as well as we do  and burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two  another frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with a group of potentiallyinteresting supporting characters  blythe danner is solid as claudias housebound mother  connie britton is suitably highstrung as claudias neurotic sister  and jennifer esposito is eyecatching as a bartender in search of a little romance  sadly  all we get is quick glimpses into their lives  although a movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the story burns has chosen to tell  none of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes  edward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here  jon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from a singer branching into a different career  but he could still use a little polish  the worst case is lauren holly  who presents a completely bland claudia  as portrayed here  shes hardly the kind of woman who would inspire even a moments interest  not to mention undying love  burns ex  the monumentally untalented maxine bahns  would have been hardpressed to do a less inspired job  when he released the brothers mcmullen  edward burns was revered as the wunderkind of the 1995 sundance film festival  robert redford has apparently stuck with him  the aging actordirector executive produced this mess   two films and three short years later  the luster has faded  some movie makers have only one good film in them  with back toback duds like shes the one and no looking back to follow the delightful brothers  burns is beginning to look like a member of that undistinguished club

0	i hate to burst your bubble  but after all the star power  mega bucks  screenwriters  directors  and cool trailers  men in black is not the best movie of the summer  its pretty good in its own right  yes  but i would probably split the  best movie  honors among faceoff  spawn  con air  and maybe event horizon  its main problem is that its quickly forgettable  and i cant remember one truly good scene from it  from con air  it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt  in spawn  it was the  living room hell  conclusion at the end  in event horizon  it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hells forces  and all of faceoff was pretty dang good  but as for men in black  the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches  i remember it not for its humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted  and yes  i did see mimic  which is something ill touch on in a later review  back to men in black  is it just me  or does that sound funny   i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard  etc   for those of you who arent comicgeeks  wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars  what the new yorker is to high society  what boys life is to boy scots  okay  that one was pretty pathetic   few people know this  but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was  while not honestpoliticianrare  very hard to find  this was after the release of the highgrossing batman forever  and it said that tommy lee jones and chris odonnell were being considered for the roles  in the comic book  there were no black men in black  kind of weird  huh   all i can say is  thank god they didnt cast chris odonnell  i know i cant be the only person on the planet who thinks hes an annoying  preppie little snot    sorry  my apologies to odonnell fans  i actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him  anticipating rather craftily that  if the movie was a big hit  it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely  he decided not to sell them to me  because they were  innappropriate   hmm     so now youre probably wondering why ive wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years  good question  ill move on to the movie now  as you probably already know  will smith and tommy lee jones  agents k and j  respectively  belong to a top secret agency known as divison 5  or its nickname mib  men in black   men in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear  and theyre mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while theyre here on earth  not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 people in the world who havent seen this movie  but a basicallybigroachtypebug lands in a redneck farmers yard  inhabits his body  and attempts to destroy the entire universe  not bad  eh   i have no idea why i just typed that  im not even really paying attention anymore   the special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black  i found their main headquarters to be boring  as were the  cool weapons  they had  the noisy cricket just plain sucked  no matter what anyone said  and the movie definitely surprised me in tone  although it probably shoudlnt have  its director  barry sonnenfield  is known for  black humor   directing both addams family movies  this movie was basically a  black comedy   not an actionscifi like i expected from the trailers  dont get me wrong on what i think of this movie  its not bad  i gave it     it was mostly entertaining throughout its run  and had a very good ending  although i think i was the only person in the theater not amazed by it  my diagnosis for this picture  a good weekend rental  but not worth a movie ticket  of course  the movie is now long gone from theaters  but thats beside the point  i think  
0	john boormans  zardoz  is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own  not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d  wood jr  has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time  of course  woods career can be explained by two things  he had no money and he had no talent  boorman  on the other hand  cannot court such excuses to explain  zardoz   or his followup film  the equally awful  exorcist ii  the heretic    boorman obviously had a sizable budget  a matinee idol movie star  sean connery  in the lead role  and although you wouldnt know it from this film  boorman does indeed have talent  this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece  deliverance   1972   as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama  hope and glory   1987   the slightly overconceived arthurian epic  excalibur   1981  and the fatherson jungle adventure  the emerald forest   1985   his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination  but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste  if boorman is anything  hes ambitious  and when he succeeds  its in grand fashion  unfortunately  the bigger they are  the harder they fall  and when boorman falls  the resounding impact can be heard for miles around    zardoz  is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies  an obsession of boormans  his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even  the wizard of oz   a book which figures into the movies plot  but  despite all this reaching  the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling  the events take place in the distant year 2293  but there is little of the typical futuristic movieness to be found  in fact  things seems to have moved backwards  with people riding horses  shooting oldstyle guns  and living in large victorian mansions  its more middle ages than space age  the world of  zardoz  is divided into two distinct hemispheres  the outlands  where all the poor  pathetic people live  and the vortex  where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life  these immortals never grow old  they never engage in sexual activity  they possess psychological powers  and they live in a sort of quasiutopian marxist society where everyone is equal  and everyone contributes equally to the society  however  if one breaks the rules  that person is punished by being aged so many years  if someone breaks the rules enough  he or she is aged to the point of senility  and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals  one of the immortals  arthur frayn  niall buggy   a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face  is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed  like  the wizard of oz   he adopts a godlike status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head    this flying head is one of the movies opening images  and its a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come   calling himself zardoz  frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators  whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they cant procreate and take up more resources  from inside his giant  stone head  zardoz bellows seriously laughinducting statements like   the gun is good  the penis is evil   that line alone is worth the movies cult following  one day  an exterminator named zed  sean connery   sneaks into zardozs flying stone  pushes frayn out  and goes back to the vortex  once there  the immortals label him a  brutal  and study him like a lab rat  taking great  perverse care in exploring his sexuality  which is a mystery to them  they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection  and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantilyclad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up  i say  hilarious  because that is exactly what  zardoz  is  it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so  he made this film with the straightest of faces  although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward  he didnt get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming  just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles  he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper  a mane of hair braided halfway down his back  a wyatt earpstyle handlebar mustache  and a pair of thighhigh patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker  boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of  deliverance   which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would greenlight this effort  he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera  including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth   2001    whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in  zardoz  besides the inadvertent humor  sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971  and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace  he got exactly that in  zardoz   and its a wonder it didnt end his career  im sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements  is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life  is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing  or is it a social statement  something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates  karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary  come to think of it  maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip  people high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy  
0	the original babe was my favorite movie of 1995  a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience  being a surprise commercial and critical success  it had no marketing tieins  which limited its final take  thus  babe 2 arrives  with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1  plush dolls  vending machines hawking tshirts  and macys thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday moneygrubbing  too late  this is a sad review to write  because babe 2 not only does not live up to the original  but it doesnt even come to a fraction of it  i shouldnt expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors magic  but this film tries too hard  and loses its charm  consider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity  unaware that his car is in neutral  imagine with me  if you will  screams jamie kennedy  explaining the  rules  for sequels like babe 2    1  there must be more talking animals    2  there must be more slapstick comedy    3  there must be more songs for those mice to sing  thats cute    4  keep the story cards to break up the action  thats cute too  even though  the pig gets wise  made no sense  given the context of that story partition    5  there must be action  however illogical  that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original  the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to  the baaramewe secret code  the  thatll do  pig  thatll do   now throw in the limitations   a  james cromwell  now a hot commodity  has limited time on the set  or maybe he didnt approve of the script     b  christine cavanaugh  the voice of the original babe  demands more money  200  000paltry considering the 80 million budget   out  e  g  daily comes in with noticable results    c  george miller  the director  is more wellknown for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment  not for kiddie fare  and no  he didnt direct that andre film in 94     d  the special effects are impressive  but limited  babe talks  but most of the time from a single shot  repeated over and over again    babe is center screen  looking straight into the camera  with a happy smirkregardless of whether hes happy  or scared  or tired   season now with the  original  elements  which  as we will find out  are straight from the screenwritingishell bin    i  change the venue into  the big city   this has been praised as wildly original  excuse me  didnt home alone do this several years ago  how about the muppets  even the bad news bears travelled to tokyo  sorry  no dice  side note  to give the city a fairytale look  george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the worlds great cities  and yes  it is impressive  but this too is overused  repeating the same view over and again on multiple occasions  and  for the most part  babe remains in the hotel    ii  given the limitations of cromwell  the human element is taken over by  the boss wife  played by magda szubanski  stretch  shes not a lead actresstype  shes not funny enough in her physical comedy  and shes simply embarrassing in some of her pratfalls    have her arrested falsely on drug charges  have her accidentally incite a riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes  have her bounce around on a bungee cord at a prestigious benefit dinner   i was hoping for a little smirk during these scenes  but i felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in  i am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film  the violence  the scene where a pit bull dangles from the bridge  head submerged underwater  even the best fairy tales have a bit of the macabre in it  as the brothers grimm have demonstrated  no    my problem is with the story  or lack thereof  babe is sent out to save the hoggett farm  but once in the city  that story is forgotten  being a goodnatured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice  but  other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull  what did babe actually do  without giving the ending away  the farm is saved from a leftfield quirk that had nothing to do with the pig  speaking of  pig   or   pigpigpigpigpig    the word  pig  is so overused  had they changed it to an expletive  and had the pig be al pacino  i could have been watching scarface  this is screenwriting  further  i cannot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen to good people in fantastically elaborate setups  had it been a cartoon  and the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd  maybe my reaction would have been softened  but to farmer hoggett  his wife  an elderly mickey rooney  much too irreverent     quick  splice those singing mice into those scenes     the film isnt a colossal failure  i did like glenne headleys schmoozy chimpanzee  i liked the pink poodle  the dog on the cart  who momentarily thinks hes in dog heaven  and a weird looking guy who may have been doublycast as an airport employee and a judge  but most of the time  i was looking down  in boredom  or in embarrassment over the hackedup script  them singing mice  those chapter partitions  the proficient acting of the animals none of these can compensate for a story  let me spoil the final scene  farmer hoggett looks at pig  proud  says  thatll do  pig  thatll do   thats it  hope i didnt ruin it for you  but tell me this  what the heck did that pig do  
1	vikings v  bears  no  this isnt the lineup for monday night football  rather  these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in  the 13th warrior   a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory  based on michael crichtons book  eaters of the dead  this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought  their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword  luckily for the vikings  however  their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film  antonio bandaras is ahmed  a travelling ambassador  accompanied by his friend  omar shariff in a cameo   they eventually come across a small viking village  we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude  they laugh heartily  revel in their arrogance  and sing songs of battles won  but their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land  help is needed quickly  an elderly  fortunetelling witch arrives  after a brief incantation  she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more  not of norse blood  are needed to ensure victory  personally  i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity  nonetheless  12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th  the group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives  of course during their ride  ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors  but he ably shows that its not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog  he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings  but will his skills  and that of the group  be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside  it does not look promising  these creatures  resembling bears  are strong and have high morale  they are fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies  they attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon  the warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods  they are ready to sacrifice their lives    this is a good way to die   says one of the fallen warriors  despite the largerthanlife battle sequences  i was unmoved by the entire experience  at many points  i was even confused  for example  somewhere in the middle of the film  a subplot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land  he seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis  however  the subplot never fully materializes  and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion  there are other questions that i had  but the real problem was that the story  little of it that there was  offered no characters to love or hate  the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma  however  banderass role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special  an entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order  also  much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night  which made battles very difficult to follow  i would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy  as it stands  the film manages more confusion than intensity  it would make thor cry  
1	i can imagine how good krippendorfs tribe must have looked on paper  it does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors  led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director  todd holland   all wanted to make this film  in fact  it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorfs tribe as possible  in retrospect  i can imagine how bad this film could have been  i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss  dreyfuss plays james krippendorf  an anthropologist who is granted 100  000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea  halfway into his twoyear expedition  his wife  apparently  dies  i say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established  later  we find out that much of the grant money was spent on bigscreen tvs and other such pleasures  so  when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely  he decides to construct an elaborate lie  he makes his own tribe  using his three children as actors in a video  he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe  which he calls the shelmickedmu   audiences at krippendorfs lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision  and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community  like all films like this  the lie becomes more and more complex  and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero  dreyfuss is a funny  talented man  and he is funny in this film  he has lots of positive energy and  unlike most comical actors  really manages to play people like this realistically  this film also requires a lot of physical humor that ive never seen dreyfuss perform  and he does a great job  jenna elfman  who plays veronica mecilli  a scientist who wants in on krippendorfs work  is also very funny and appealing here  and the kid actors are great  as well  but were talking about the script from hell  this is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen  but the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it  all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew  no  the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and meanspirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched  furthermore  the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless  take  for instance  the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex  they get all decked out in the tribe getup  complete with paint to darken their skin  krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe  now  i saw this scene coming from a mile away  but i said to myself   no  that would be far too tasteless  theres no way theyll do that    oh god   they did do it  its there  i was almost more appalled by the fact that this didnt bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film  i found it deplorable  and when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it  he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice  the film is filled with scenes like these  they not only insult the audience  but they insult the types of people that the film portrays  it would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists  yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon  and watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining  but i think that most members of the onscreen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes  if i were an anthropologist  this film would insult me immensely  moving right along  the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes  sure  dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny  and it allows for some entertaining scenes  but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes  it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film  his character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar  and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does  i suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case  but for the purposes of good taste  i would have expected something  no  this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues  and the writer of the film  charlie peters  didnt include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad  in fact  its his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing  and he continually shrugs off her warnings  i suppose its important to admit that this is a funny film  dreyfuss and elfman  and many of the contrived and insulting scenes  add up to a picture that is anything but boring  and if youre less serious than i  you probably will enjoy it  i  however  cant get past these elements  krippendorfs tribe is being marketed as a family comedy  but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldnt be learning  with a little more insight into its story and themes  this could have been a good movie  
0	nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre   frankenweenie    beetlejuice    batman    edward scissorhands    ed wood    mars attacks    yet none of them have been horror films    sleepy hollow  is his first attempt to actually scare people  i greeted the prospect with high anticipation  burtons whole career seemed to be leading up to this  i left disappointed  andrew kevin walkers screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story  the legend of sleepy hollow   in the movie ichabod crane  johnny depp  is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors  ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders  several of the towns leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman  although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him  ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning  he also discovers that the killings are not random  that the victims are tied together by a secret  along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching  literally  young woman  christina ricci  and the son of one of the murder victims  marc pickering   my reaction  hohum  the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting  that in itself is forgivable  hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages  however  burtons attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy  it might be his background  in his previous movies  goofy was the goal  along the same lines  it doesnt help that creature designer  and producer  kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongueincheek tales from the crypt tv series  a witchs eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbits  a tree spurts blood like its in a monty python sketch  and the headless horseman      well  hes a guy without a head      on a horse  boo    the performances are also awful  although hes impressed me with his work in other films  depp doesnt seem to know what to do with ichabod  and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction thats supposed to pass for an 18th century accent  ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic  which guarantees that we wont sympathize with her character  the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish  the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee  martin landau  and christopher walken  i wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppolas projected series of gothic adaptations  a series that produced only  bram stokers dracula  and  mary shelleys frankenstein   coppola is an executive producer for  sleepy hollow   and the script reflects his interest in early forms of  moving pictures   particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion    theres a bird on one side of the card  a cage on the other  when the card is flipped rapidly  the bird appears to be caged   bottom line  the hollow isnt the only thing thats sleepy  
0	lets get this one over with as quickly as possible  if there was a possibility to receive a refund  this review would not be forthcoming  but as it is   godzilla  is without a doubt the loudest  longest  and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio  producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves  and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch  last year at merienbad  until they can grasp the idea of content and plot  no amount of hype  no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine  billy the kid vs  dracula     godzilla  opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs  we are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship  a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins   well  the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature  later  a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache  jean reno  interview the sole survivor  in a state of shock  the only thing the man can utter is the word  gojira   the japanese name of the famed beast   we are then introduced to dr  nick tatopoulos  matthew broderick  with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film   he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population  he is immediately drafted by the u  s  military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature  in a short amount of time  another fishing boat  loaded with canned tuna from the u  s  and korea for some reason  is found grounded in jamaica  well  it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york  when the beast finally appears  he tears up one building  stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert  thumbs up for new york   the military  with dr  tatopouloss help  have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system  it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr  tatopoulos who snaps the beasts picture  the monster eats the fish  the military starts shooting  and the chase is on  with the army causing 90 of the ensuing damage  working from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple  dr  totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open  even though new york has been evacuated   well the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant  needless to say  no one believes the good doctor about his discovery  so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monsters nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city  even though the monster isnt dead yet   i sincerely hope that ive completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film  i gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous  or foolish  enough to drop down an hours wage on this tripe  everything about  godzilla  reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast  the script  and lets be clear here  by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years  razzie  award  the dialogue between maria pitillo  as audrey timmonds  dr  tatopoulos estranged girlfriend  and mr  broderick is so adolescent  it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief  as happened during the screening i witnessed   the film could be enjoyably campy if it didnt take itself so damn seriously  but to what end  as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature  nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind  no  godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it  the film is bleak and ugly looking  taking place at night during a rain storm  the movie has little or no depth  everything is ugly and dark  new york has never looked so inhospitable since  death wish   in an attempt to give the film some color  audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue  the only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica  where dr  tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint  the scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up  you know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint  for a scientist  this is very poor observation  lets look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film  this activity  is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game   1   why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs  and how do those eggs fuse into one beast  2   why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate  such as new york  to nest  i dont think iguanas have a habit of migrating  3   how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system  slice a submarine in half  yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin  in comparison  steel cable on the brooklyn bridge  4   the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need its suspension cables  5   did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly  if so  then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures    note  each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide  godzilla would have to be over 1  000 feet tall to carry them all   6   godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters  but new york cabs are made of stronger steel  7   godzilla can out maneuver helicopters  bullets  torpedoes and missiles  but cant catch you on foot  8   taxis can out maneuver godzilla  9   godzilla can burrow through the subway system but cant tear through the park avenue tunnel  10   why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla  maybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel  11   galapagos iguanas actually live in the french polynesian islands  12   why was dr  tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway  13   how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day  and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey  14   new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting  new yorkers hate beta cam  i could go on and on  but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is  dont be fooled  this film has less gray matter than any episode of  americas funniest home videos   the performances in the film are singularly bland  not one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror  the characters  in the midst of the onslaught  have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee  failed relationships  career choices  the only common occurrence that doesnt take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement  but then that would have made them believable  godzilla for the most part is okay  the design of the beast is funky  if not very memorable  one thing that comes to mind the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark  namely his atomic breath  now  i for one cant quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait  a good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly  there is so much wrong with this film that i cant really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted  except for my divorce   any film that can have a two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac  the addition of the baby raptors  ah  i meant godzillas   are nothing but a direct rip off of jurassic park   but with none of that films suspense or tension  suffice to say that   godzilla  is without a doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade  this is a film that needed the hype  with the current level of writing and directing  nothing else about the film succeeds  if youve seen the trailers  youve seen the best parts  my only suggestion for mr  d and mr  e  is that they could always go back to selling shoes    this film could be the next  rocky horror   only its not funny  
0	the characters in jonathan lynns  the whole nine yards   yet another in an endless recent string of mob comedies  1999s  analyze this  and  mickey blue eyes   2000s  gun shy    are rarely ever written as real people  but merely as onedimensional caricatures  when an added layer to one of their personalities is revealed  it is not to service the character development  or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations  but to accommodate the convoluted plot  in a lightweight comedy  you might say  it is not required to have perfectly realized figures  just as long as they get the job done  unfortunately  for a comedy to work  it has to at least succeed at being funny  and if there was a laughometer available  id guess that it briefly ascended around 2  5 of the time for me  suffice to say  the comedy in  the whole nine yards  works about as well as the brokendown lawnmower in my backyard  and when a giggle surprisingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes  it is by sheer luck  nicholas  oz  oseransky  matthew perry  is an amateur dentist living in the quiet suburbs of quebec  trapped in a hateful marriage with the conniving sophie  rosanna arquette  delightfully hamming it up with a clearly artificial frenchcanadian accent   one day oz sees that someone is moving into the house nextdoor  walking over to greet him  he is horrified to discover it is jimmy  the tulip  tudeski  bruce willis   a former contract killer for the mafia who has just been released from prison  once getting to know him and becoming his friend  oz is more comfortable with his identity  but for sophie  it means a possible hitman to do away with oz  in her scheme  sophie sends oz to chicago to cash in by informing his old mob boss  kevin pollak  about jimmys whereabouts  but in the process  he falls in love with jimmys wife  cynthia  natasha henstridge   who is being held hostage  upon return to quebec  and with one contrivance after the next  ozs dental assistant  jill  amanda peet   is overjoyed to discover that he lives beside  the tulip   and forces him to set up a meeting  since jills dream in life turns out being a contract killer herself  have you got all that  because there is more  much  much more  and this is a movie that  without credits  is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour    the whole nine yards  is an ultimately unsatisfying and emptyheaded excursion into wellworn terrain already set by far superior pictures  how the cast  most of which are respectable actors  got caught up in such a cliched  deficient film remains a mystery  unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynns 1985 comedy classic   clue  the movie   going into the theater  preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable  but by the twentyminute mark  when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time  it was clear this production was in serious trouble  since the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot  and the screenplay  inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner  collapses with every failing  comedy  bit  the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and  frequently  entertainment value    the whole nine yards  is neither facetious nor  aside from the subplot about jills shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman  inventive  and more often than not  just lies there  the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector  but never igniting any sort of spark  a few select actors do what they can with the material  while others make no impact at all  on the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters  matthew perry and bruce willis  perry  innocuously enjoyable on tvs  friends   plays the same exact sitcomstyle character in all of his movies  from 1997s  fools rush in  to 1999s  three to tango    and it has become a crushing bore  meanwhile  willis makes next to no impression  and because of the limited guise of his jimmy  the tulip  tudeski  oftentimes disappears into the background  their three female counterparts fare noticeably better  best of all is natasha henstridge  far more radiant than in the exploitative  species  movies  who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia  henstridge has the talent  for sure  to break out of these countless throwaway roles  but first she must fire her agent  amanda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill  and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who  thus far  has strived on a career based solely on comedy  it is too bad  then  that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene  with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts  finally  rosanna arquette is awful as sophie  but something tells me that was her purpose  and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time  also popping up is michael clarke duncan  fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in  the green mile   as jimmys largely built friend and fellow killer  frankie figs  when  the whole nine yards  eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion  one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit  a great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past  and this one is nothing but a duplication of better films  so what was the point  without a passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments   the whole nine yards  rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast  and half of the actors are not charming at all  now  what does that tell you  
1	girl 6 is  in a word  a mess  i was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film  there was no sense of where the film was going  or any kind of coherent narrative  if there was a point to the film  i missed it  girl 6  by the way  is the way theresa randles character is addressed in the phone sex workplace  all the girls are known by their numbers  the plot  such as it is  theresa randle is a struggling n  y  actress  and eventually takes a job as a phonesex operator  she begins to lose contact with reality  as her job consumes her  also  she must deal with the advances of her exhusband  isiah washington   he is an ex con thief  and she tries to keep him away  while at the same time  its clear that she still harbors feelings for him  her neighbor  jimmy  spike lee  functions as the observer  mediating between the ex husband and girl 6  he also functions as a point of stability  as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex  the soundtrack  consisting of songs by prince  was jarring  it kept taking my attention from the film  not altogether a bad thing  ill grant you  as what was transpiring onscreen wasnt that riveting  for parts of the middle of the film  the music stayed blissfully in the background  in the opening sequence and one scene later in the film  however  the music was particularly loud and distracting  of course  ive never really cared for princes  or tafkap if you like  music  prince fans might love the soundtrack  but it will probably be distracting  even to diehard fans  of the performances  the only one that stood out was spike lees buddy character  jimmy  he was excellent as the alwaysbroke neighbor of girl 6  he should have stuck to acting in this film  there are several sequences that gave me the impression that hed like to be oliver stone when he grows up  there are scenes shot with different types of film  which are purposely grainy  and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stones natural born killers  in that film  they worked to propel the narrative  in this film  they just made me more confused  there are some amusing moments  and a few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phonesex industry the multibillion dollar industry that it has become  other than that  though  nothing much happens  there are a few intense moments  as when one caller becomes frightening  but even that is rather lackluster  im not the biggest fan of spike lee  though id agree that he has done some very good work in the past  in girl 6  though  he seems to be floundering  he had an interesting idea  a fairly good setup  and seemed to wander aimlessly from there  girl 6 earns a grade of d  
1	long ago  films were constructed of strong dialogue  original characters  memorable plot points  and solid acting  one of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is  this opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows the tragic  and i mean tragic  life of novalee nation  natalie portman   hitting the road with her hick  guitarplaying boyfriend in a rustedout gm  novalee dreams of the blue skies of bakersfield and sipping chocolate milk beneath a plastic umbrella with her unborn baby  due in a month  stopping off at a nearby walmart for a quick rest  novalees boyfriend decides to take off and leaves her there  novalee then decides to secretly hole up in the walmart  because shes not the brightest bulb in the stagelights   a wacky librarian  keith david  comes to her rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the outdoors section of the store  then the she moves in with a family  befriends everyone in town  including ashley judds character  who has five kids and still can work parttime as a nurse   fights off religious freaks  survives a tornado  breaks the heart of the wacky librarian that saved her  receives an inheritance  builds a martha stewartesque house  becomes an awardwinning photographer  and manages to always look like she stepped out of a cosmo shoot  all while not once doing anything with her kid  this film is terrible  the directing is awful  it seems director matt williams had an index card with six angles written on it and used every one of them  over and over and over again  we get pathetic and ugly acting by natalie portman  who can do good work  a disjointed pacing of key scenes and a time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off  a subplot that actually validates the actions of the boyfriend who abandoned novalee in the walmart parking lot  an embarrassing display of emotions by the characters  making the audience ill  taking two great comedic screenwriters  babaloo mandel and lowell ganz  and forcing them to write drama on par with oprahs book club  altogether  it has the feeling of being trapped at home  watching a very bad television miniseries and wishing it to end  only the remote is broken  however  the main problem with the film is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up  where is the heart  no one ever seems to find it in this piece of junk

1	i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film  i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying   it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday  and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach  throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof  well have a hit on our hands   the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film  a mishmash collage of onedimensional characters  rampant stereotypes of cultures and races  cliched emotional statements of purpose  and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography  the story is loosely based around the pro football players strike in 1987 and a ragtag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels  keanu reeves stars as shane falco  a hasbeen football college player looking for redemption  gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers  rounding out the cast includes swingers jon favreau  7up pitchman orlando jones  gruff owner jack warden  and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters  the drunken welshman  the overweight sumo wrestler  the black convict  the violent cop  and the dumb  dumb cheerleaders  this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays  gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is  keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field  and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from dennys  the usual things happen like clockwork  the hero rises from the ashes of failure  the team comes together in unity  the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest  the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap  and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax  its also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks  howard deutch  who was behind the camera for two of the best films of 80s  pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful  has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes  obviously the problem is that without a good script  any director will fail in the end  sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory  gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds  the rise and fall of gallant heroes  and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life  the replacements offers none of this  
0	unfortunately it doesnt get much more formulaic than one tough cop  theres the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain  the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys  the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film  bo dietl  pronounced deedle  baldwin  is one tough cop  a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia  on top of that problem  he has a drunk  gambling addicted partner  penn  who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets  i guess cops arent immune    then  throw into the mix the femme fatale  gershon   right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama  but right in the middle of the film  they throw in a completely unrelated plot point  dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from  the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death  once the case is solved  the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue  whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably  aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso  an insult if you ask me  the performances were pretty good  baldwin  though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec  does a fine job as one tough cop  penn  who also slips into an impression of his brother sean  is even better as a loser tough guy cop  what one tough cop lacks is originality  this film offers nothing new  nothing that you cant get from any cop film  it screams sidney lumet all over the place  perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman  producers of lumets dog day afternoon and serpico  but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film  too much else is lacking  i also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture  something that i almost never notice  but once i saw that  i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot  at times  i was hoping to see it  one tough cop isnt laughable  nor is it a terrible film  but it just isnt unique  it is a classic example of a film that didnt need to be made  but one thing is for sure  it could really use a better title  
1	lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4  episode 1 is a boring  empty spectacle that features some nice special effects  after the familiar a long time ago      opening  the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game  the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo  ruled by queen amidala  portman  jedi knights quigon  neeson  and obi wan  mcgregor  are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade  however  this simple blockade is not all it seems  and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers  including facing the evil darth maul  ray park   they also meet the future darth vadar  anakin skywalker  jake lloyd  star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking  script  direction and characters  the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic  the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star  and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more nonexistent  theres no underlying tension  and no urgent need to see what the outcome is  the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story  which doesnt help  theres no snap to make the film work  it moves at a plod  the script is boring  all the characters speak in morals  especially anakins mother  theres no group spirit evident here  and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders  its evident that not much is going to happen  the two leads are hideously boring  static characters given little to do and too much time to do it  quigon and obiwan hold no presence on film  and give little for the audience to root for  the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul  if he had been given more screen time  maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history  even if he does provide the only straight plot line in the film  all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy   anakin is annoying and unlikeable   instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended  its probably not surprising that his hateful little boy  unfortunately blessed ani by everyone he knows  joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible  the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks  although in the end none is provided in the film by him  although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys  the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny  the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a pod racer  because i knew he wouldnt be able to talk for a while  queen amidala is a nothing in the film  she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must serve her people   and go googoo over anakin  again  her role will become more important in the later episodes  and is given little to do here  the actors dont help the movie much either  liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed  and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible  mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy  with little charm  the casting director must have chose him because hes scottish like alec guinness  theres little other explanation for it  natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script  but she delivers a spunky performance  and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice  theres very little talent evident with him  its hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there  hes not even very cute   the main claim of the film  the special effects  are okay  theres nothing impressive about them  yet they complement the story well  the cgi takes away much of the human element  however  the battle droids for example  the replacement for the stormtroopers  are characterless little computer graphics  lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers  episode 1 is just disappointing  its got high production values  but little else  the music is meandering  except near the end  the plot gives us noone to root for  or even care for  the effects are nice  but dull  the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should  theres an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair  and many clich  s are catered for throughout the film  apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence  episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose  except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film  disappointing is barely the word  rating 
1	if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films  i might say that i review movies that dont look particularly good because im doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it  if that were true  i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads   shay casey  seeing bad movies so you dont have to   but i know thats bunkyoure going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say  so i have to tell the truth  every once in a while i get a nasty  masochistic urge to see a bad movie  you know the feeling  when youre sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly  sometimes i think thats why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies  ever  admit it  sometimes you like seeing bad movies  so do i  so i saw  supernova   truth be told   supernova  wasnt quite as bad as i thought it might be  maybe i just felt sorry for the actors  or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadnt started tinkering with the directors  walter hill  final cut  causing him to want his name removed  maybe im becoming a softy  in any case  i didnt find  supernova  as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe  but its still bad  the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel  nightingale   the crew includes captain a  j  marley  robert forster   his new second officer nick vanzant  james spader   head medical officer kaela evers  angela bassett   medical technicians yerzy penalosa  lou diamond phillips  and danika lund  robin tunney   and computer technician benj sotomejor  wilson cruz   there are some attempts at  characterization   but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction  which puts kaela on edge  yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissyfaces at each other every five minutes  and benj  apparently gay  is in love with the computer  apparently female   dont expect any more explanation  because you wont get it  anyway  the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent  during the dimension jump  i think thats what its called  but dont hold me to it   the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal  peter facinelli  is brought on board  he calls himself troy larson  making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with  then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening  have you seen  alien   have you seen  event horizon   a lame movie in its own right   good  then youve seen  supernova   postproduction cuts or not  there is nothing original about this screenplay  and nothing unpredictable either  after all  no ones going to think for a second that troy wont turn out to be a villain  but the bigger problem with  supernova  is that it can t just stick to the simple plot its afforded  numerous rewrites  the script may be credited to three people  but its a gross underestimate  have crammed this lean 90minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped  was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot  did the ships computer learn something about humanity  what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him  and just what does the films title signify  if anything  as far as i can tell  it refers to a very small plot detail that isnt developed  just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements  character relationships in this film also make very little sense  for some reason  every person in this film keeps having sex  we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes  bassett and spaders characters start off hating each other  fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later  theyre engaging in some hankypanky  when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship  of course both female crew members will fall in love with him  every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly  which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut  the most prominent example  however  may be the fact that when the film starts  there are no opening credits  furthermore  the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits  maybe thats why the films title is mentioned twice during the end credits  right between james spader and robert forster  right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie youre seeing  lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery   you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene  with littletono introduction to any of the characters or situations  the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes  you know  where they explain things  and just went from point a to point b  point a  danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby  point b  tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing  doesnt make sense  since i didnt understand anything about these characters motivations  did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them onebyone  and he does  knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes   not a whit  its a shame  because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do  they dont find it  bassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces  sexual tension  more like constipation  maybe theyre just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as  this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice   not that we ever find out who that is  mind you  the climax of their relationship  taking place in a transport pod  is probably the films biggest foreheadslapper  as troy  peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected  he s awfully onenote  but its not as if hes given any more notes to work with  the rest of the cast does even less  tunney stands around looking cute  then scared  phillips broods  cruz flirts with the computer  then they all die and a star blows up or something  but i really wasnt paying much attention by then    supernova  is pretty awful  but im cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got  thats it  if you expect it to be good  for whatever reasons you may have   youll probably hate it more than i will  even the special effects are fairly unimpressive  nothing you haven t seen before  and suffice to say the script isnt going to save the film  honestly  though  what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym  it usually results in a bad movie  and thats what  supernova  is  
1	if theres one thing in common about all of hollywoods major studios  its that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more  although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures  fox searchlight and fine line respectively   its obvious theres no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater  so when a movie like gary ross pleasantville comes along  wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production  its a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes  although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted  pleasantville should not be mistaken for a nothought movie  quite the opposite is true  in fact  as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen  the story  both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation  captures the essence of statementmaking in the cinema  not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution  and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross work  it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough  kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture  it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who  through quite a bit of luck  find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named  pleasantville   maguire  as the reserved bud parker  is perfect for the pseudoworld  but the rebellious mary sue  witherspoon  is not at all made for the fatherknowsbest times  its not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end  and begins to teach the townspeople  in a quite unlikely way  what life is  really  like  soon hues of color creep into the black and white world  and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism  others fear the strangeness  at one end is a soda shop ownerturnedpainter named mr  johnson  jeff daniels  and at the other end is a closeminded mayor  j  t  walsh  and his chamber of commerce  but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town  fine performances are turned in all around  maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads  but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j  t  walsh  in his latest and final posthumous performance   daniels brings an atmosphere of awe  inspiration  and hope to his character  whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness  almost to the point where you can sense gene hackmans envy  for daniels  its his most commendable performance of the last three years  or more  and for walsh  its a complementary exclamation point on a fine career  also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen  and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish  theres not much to dislike about pleasantville  and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who dont  
0	now  lets first look into the history of shark films  there was the unforgettable jaws  the exciting jaws 2  the rather flaky jaws 3d and sometime in the late 90s another film of the same genre that i cant seem to recall  about the son of jaws returning to wreak revenge or something like that   now  with the magic of cgi  one shark is simply not enough  in deep blue sea  there are 3 big  mean and really smart ones  russell frankiln  jackson  visits aquatica  a seabound research center   where a research is being conducted on the extraction of a hormone substance found uniquely within the shark brain that can cure and reverse the effects of alzheimers disease  the substance is small in quantity and because of this  lead researcher dr  susan macalaester genetically alters the shark dna and grows them twice the size with brains as big as humans  naturally producing more of the much treasured hormones  as sure as the sun sets in the west  a shark breaks lose and wreaks havoc within the facility during a hormone extraction procedure  with the flexibility offered by cgi  the sharks get more fulllength screen time as their predecessors did in those remotecontrolled rubber suit days  gone are the days of people getting pulled under the water with the water turning red right after  this time  we get to see the entire gobbling action  with floating limbs and all  soso acting  expected in most of your average action film  jackson  fresh from his jedi master role in the phantom menace   takes on the darkside force of a different kind and fits well with his wisecracking lines  ll cool js cook role as preacher  does for this film what steven seagals cook could only dream to achieve in his two under siege films  deep blue sea does not offer any of the psychological thrills that jaws has to offer  it does however  prove to be a refreshing followup within the genre  full of visual thrills  suspense and believe it or not  humour  its like jurassic park under water  nothing too stressful  pure entertainment  renny harlin  you are forgiven  for making cutthroat island   
1	isnt it the ultimate sign of a movies cinematic ineptitude when you cant think of much to say about it other than  it sucks   one of the first official year 2000 releases  supernova is such a movie  i cant seem to get past oneword adjectives with this one  although  boring    stupid  and  absurd  doesnt amount to much of a review  a shame  i would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate  but cest la vie  here goes nothing  ill keep it short  i suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill  48 hours  removed his name from the movie  requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee  the films fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press  an event usually signifying a studios lack of confidence in a particular movie  hills and mgms actions were prudent  when the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident  a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer  for some reason  james spader  is forced to take command  the ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and  on arrival  picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining colony  one of the crew members  angela bassett  knows this passenger  who is played by peter facinelli  and has some bad feelings about it  and we all know what that means  this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo  a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown  though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it  another one of the crew members experiences this first hand  after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo  he does some impressive handstand pushups  evidently  touching this enigmatic eggshaped thingie makes you younger and stronger  how  why  the movie never bothers to explain  soon enough though  spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad  being chased by the allofasuddensuperhuman facinelli  to be honest  i dont even remember exactly why  i just remember that i didnt care  supernovas plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas  such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb  but they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything truly intriguing  in fact  everything is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set  well  the effects are good  though theres hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so im not sure whether thats so remarkable an accomplishment  the performances are hardly worth talking about  im not even sure i can call whats here  performances   though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger  james spader is not a bad actor  but he proves to be one of the blandest action stars ive seen in a while  mostly because he isnt given a character with a personality  the action scenes are just as bland  since theyre pretty much just rehashes of action elements that werent particularly entertaining the first time around  and since the action scenes are everything to this movie  its pretty much dead in the water  and for the life of me  i cant figure out why its called supernova  
1	you know something  christmas is not about presents  its about overhyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tieins  at least that would seem to be the message of  the grinch   which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores  hollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season  you know the plot  theres this evil furry green guy called the grinch  jim carrey  who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville  down below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation  but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas  the movie is  of course  a liveaction version of the beloved childrens book  which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones  its rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirtyyearold halfhour cartoon  but thats the case when jones version is compared to ron howards  the tv grinch hit all the right notes  boris karloffs soft  deep narration  thurl ravenscroft singing  mr  grinch   max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head  and the grinchs wide  toothless grin  by contrast  the movie hits one sour note after another  first  there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a 105minute movie  young wideeyed cindy lou who  taylor momsen  is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents  bill irwin and molly shannon  during the holiday season  she begins to sympathize with the grinch  who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic  cindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class  martha may whovier  played as an adult by christine baranski   are we expected to like the grinch  hate the whos  and want him to steal christmas  the grinch isnt even the villain here  that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville  jeffrey tambor  who was the grinchs rival for marthas affection  not only are the characters needlessly complex  but the oncesimple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought  the casting choices arent any better than the screenwriting decisions  jim carrey seems woefully miscast  while his face is so supple that the rubber makeup seems superfluous  carrey brings nothing else to the role  his accent keeps changing  i assume he was shooting for karloff  but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon  sean connery  and cartman from  south park   not knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinchs home  carrey falls back on his standup comedy and clowns around ace venturastyle  needless to say  his wisecracking antics dont quite fit the character of the grinch  who is an embittered loner filled with hate  little taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes and a cute smile  she would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story  finding  santa  in her living room stealing the tree   however  the expanded script makes cindy as important as the grinch  and momsen is not up to the challenge  bottom line  when youre stealing christmas  movies   leave this one behind  
0	not too many people know who james whale is  but its a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies  if we are to believe the semi biographical gods and monsters  whale would have wanted it to be that way  this is an insightful  haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director  and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie  gods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whales life because it tracks only the final few days of his life  and its probably a better movie for it  its focus is on whales  ian mckellen  untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone  brendan fraser   it begins with whale  a fairly talented artist  aside from being a director  asking boone to  sit for him    pose for a portrait   at first  boone doesnt realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man  when he does discover whales sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid  lynn redgrave   he is frightened  refusing to sit for the guy  but he comes back  only to storm out again  disgusted with whales  locker room talk   boone returns yet another time  after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned  locker room talk   and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening  meanwhile  jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago  his ailment leads to desperation and depression  which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor  what is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan frasers bravura performance  up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in  blast from the past  for example   i was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here  this is impressive because his characters dialogue is minimal  with mckellan doing most of the talking  that requires fraser to act through body language  a difficult skill to master  but something he proves capable of doing well  this is not to ignore mckellans oscar nominated turn  he earned that nomination with his touching performance here  although  at the risk of sounding like a philistine  i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination   an understated  compelling gem  whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre  and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield  he rejoiced in being free from it  only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people  in the end  perhaps  it is what killed him  the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare    1999 eugene novikov137  
1	the premise of this movie is  well  pretty farfetched  tom berenger plays shale  a mercenary who is temporarily out of work  those fools at the cia have denied his existence just because he and his buddies botched a job in cuba   fortunately  his girl friend  diane venora   a teacher at christopher columbus high school in miami  gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student  creating a job opening for shale as a substitute teacher  not telling his girl friend  who might object on pedagogical grounds  he creates a number of fake higher degrees for himself  from yale  harvard  princeton  et al  and begins his tenure as a high school teacher  the students  junkies  drug dealers  gang members  sleazy sluts  icepick wielders    you get the picture  dont really take to him right away  so he hits one in the face with a can and breaks a few fingers  this gets their attention to a certain extent  so he tells them the story of the vietnam war   see  some homeboys from the north tried to muscle in on the turf of the homeboys from the south   oh yeah  now they can dig it  the problem is just that nobody ever explained it properly before  but wait  there are drugs being dealt in the school itself  and behind the whole scheme  in cahoots with the head gang  the kod  no  not  cod   but  knights of destruction     really    is none other than    the upright  excop principal  played by the forgotten ghostbuster  ernie hudson  so shale does what any good teacher would do  he gets his buddies together  they gather together a bunch of bazookas and other major weapons  explosives  and cool stuff like that  and they have a big showdown against the drug dealers and kod at the high school  ok  so the premise is not just farfetched  its downright dumb  if this were a hong kong action comedy  we might just accept it  but it takes itself far too seriously to be truly fun  oh  it has its moments  how one can truly hate a movie in which huge  really huge  amounts of cocaine are delivered in school busses  and to be fair  it is almost never really boring  as the action is interrupted by only short sequences of actual story  but over all  this is pretty much a madefortv movie with more  and bigger  explosions and more foul language  in fact  it reminded me of  miami vice  without the production values  babes in skimpy bikinis  and pastels  if you can sneak into the theater without paying  go for it  otherwise  wait for video  the flying inkpot rating system   wait for the tv2 broadcast     a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha      pretty good  bring a friend       amazing  potent stuff        perfection  see it twice  
0	with his successful books and movies  michael crichton is doing well  with early successes with westworld  1973  and coma  1978   and recent films such as jurassic park  1993   his films have been entertaining  however  he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere  this 100 million mess by good director barry levison  disclosure  is dull  long winded  and a huge disappointment  considering the huge budget  the all star cast  and a story by crichton  sphere is majorly disappointing  the film opens with norman goodman  hoffman   a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors  however  when he arrives  he his told by supervisor barnes  peter coyote  that he is actually investigating an spacecraft  along with goodman is mathematician harry adams  jackson   biologist beth halperin  stone  and ted fielding  liev schrieber   they investigate the spaceship  find a massive sphere inside  meet an alien intelligence called jerry  and basically weird crap happens  unfortunately  something went wrong along the way with sphere  the film starts off entertaining enough  but throughout this very long movie  it just gets sillier and sillier  the film jaunts along from scene to scene  never fully explaining what is going on  the actors and directing dont help  either  hoffman is on autopilot  and almost seems embarrassed  throughout the movie  churning out dull lines  and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie  stone is useless  displaying no emotion  and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman  the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson  whos funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere  but hes hardly in it  and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone  the same goes for peter coyote  who hams it up as the officer  but is then killed off halfway through  the director  barry levinson  who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure  1994  messes up with the drama and the action  the drama scenes are  quite frankly  boring  and the action scenes suffer from overkill  with levison throwing the camera all over the place  much like the godawful speed 2  1997  the writing doesnt help much  either  although crichton is great with plots  hes terrible with dialogue  and practically every line in sphere is a dud  the speech is too simple  i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent  practically every line is just stating the obvious  none of it is smart  also  where the hell did the budget go  the sphere itself is impressive  and theres a few nice special effect shots  but where the 100 million went is anyones guess  theres a giant squid attack in the picture  but not once does the audience see the squid  even though the film has a massive budget  i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid  and if handled correctly it probably would  but the whole scene is done badly  and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid  finally  the film has no idea what genre to be  levison cant handle his own plot  it leaps from hokey scifi  to horror  and finally the shiningevent horizon psychological thriller  and  of course  the film is very much like the abyss  1988   although in its defense  crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released  and is far superior to this rubbish   its not all that bad though  the plot is all right  theres a few jump scenes  although nothing very scary  and theres the occasionally interesting bit  but overall  sphere is a big waste of some fine talent  a lot of money  and a potentially good movie  not really worth seeing  overall rating review by david wilcock 
1	vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico  the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow  james woods  is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out  while the initial imagery is a little overdramatic  it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence  that is enough action to last us a while and we could  director john carpenter would let us  get to a story line  but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene  then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that  the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end  and that is something of a pity because the film  based on the book vampire by john steakley  gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery  this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film  but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it  what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires  there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore  anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans  this has not always been carpenters style  his 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the films central science fictional question  jack crow heads a vampire swat team  cleaning up nests of vampires with hightech spears and crossbows  in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek  thomas ian griffith  who has been tipped off to who crow is  now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya  daniel baldwin   to make matters worse  he does not know the people on his own side  tony and his backers  he can trust  meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico  if this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions  thats exactly what it is  the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin  but carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film  show people  dont tell them  just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown  fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding  why are the vampires in new mexicowhat do they want and why do they want it  what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church  how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it  the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized  but instead are revealed through dialog  now if all this was not bad enough  carpenter misuses the james wood persona  woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well  but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergioleone style mythic posturing  while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target  woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero  that is not his style and it just does not work very well  there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses  in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor  one female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair  as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down  one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret  these vampires do not maintain a low profile  there are arguably logical flaws in the film  there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires  it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires  yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight  i suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out  while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale  perhaps i will read the book  
0	after having heard so many critics describe  return to me  as an oldfashioned hollywood romance  i kept asking myself going into this movie  what exactly is an oldfashioned hollywood romance  what made  return to me  oldfashioned and oldhollywood  was it the tunes from sinatra  etc   legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on  was it the glamorous  sophisticated feel  the charisma of the two leads  even now i cant say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer  because i havent see that many oldfashioned hollywood romances  i dont think any of the romances ive seen have been classified as such  which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics   return to me  was oldfashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic  the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider  it was traditional  magical  we knew it couldnt be too daring  or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in  it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity  tenderness  and love  from director bonnie hunt  that it couldnt help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings  the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunts direction  from the very first birds eye view of chicago  zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland  david duchovny   accompanied by the  return to me  ballad  by whom    we can tell were in for something sweet  the scenes between the characters are endearing  truthful  with just a hint of fantasy  real people dont act that way  real people arent that nice  we know all this  and yet we want to believe in these folks existence  the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale  but hunts rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal  everything is ordinaryyet beautifulin this film  from the festive little family restaurant to grace  minnie driver  and bobs wardrobes  from the eloquent  notinahurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints  from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen  the most beautiful part    return to me  has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family  the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist  we care for them  laugh with them  cry with them  were concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father  whatever hunt did  she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors  disappointingly  david alan griers charlie  however much i like him  was the most flatlywritten  duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona  with the help of his fellow costars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder  instead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of  the xfiles   duchovny  who is excellent at understatement and selfdeprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen  minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet  innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer  though an unlikely pair  duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses  while  return to me  functions remarkably as a laughoutloud comedy  a romantic scenic tour through chicago  and a tearjerker  the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop  the entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wifes heart  we already know that theres going to be a happy ending  we feel like we spend the entire film  however enjoyably  in a straight line going towards that point  as a result bob and grace click almost too quicklyyes  i know shes supposed to have his exwifes heart and everythingit seems too effortless  the main subject is a love story  and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters  whose story might not have that much meat after all   however  in the spirit of  return to me   it wont do to be too picky about how  old  hollywood tells its stories  i loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt  it shows  the bottom line   return to me  is nothing remarkable  and yet its sweetness  sincerity  and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadnt imagined

1	are you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store  wafflemovies  com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves  everyweek  wafflemovies  com reviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video  here is a sample review  welcome to sarajevo in light of americas recent intervention in kosovo  welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years  set in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events  this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war  the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding  as they make their way down the street  a sniper shoots the mother of the bride  yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war  in this scene  we meet joe flynn  woody harrelson   an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church  joe is cocky  but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesnt even know  his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson  stephen dillane   michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the worlds lack of interest  henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mothers death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread  he decides to take action when a united nations delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth  henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines  he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult  during his visits  he befriends a preteen girl  emira  emira nuseric  who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner  he promises to get emira out of harms way if he gets the chance  after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children  henderson loses hope  however  his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina  marisa tomei  and her childrens aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans  unfortunately  only babies are wanted for adoption  so henderson pledges to take emira to england  the group of children  nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy  can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps  the movie was beautifully and sensitively made  director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred  they show the destroyed lives  families that have been split up  and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with  this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson  his producer and flynn have befriended  the group of twentysomethings reside in a bombed out bar without lifes simplest pleasures and amenities  one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth  like the rest of those deeply effected by the war  this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live  winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room  the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics  winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities  this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies  com selection mad city  we watch them struggle to cover the horror  while trying to remain professionally detached  however  they are human and question the reason behind it all  why no one cares  and how they can get out  stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson  he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events  dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy  henderson realizes that he cannot save the world  but he can help a few  it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis learysandra bullock disaster two if by sea  woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest  most versatile actors of his generation  harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the characters caring nature and vulnerability shine through  harrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men  cheers  white men cant jump  as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one  this ability will serve him well and give him a long  successful career  americas involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place  for those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict  the entire movie  most importantly the opening scenes  provide a history lesson  war is a foreign concept to most of us in america  battles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to  televised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war  this picture brings it right into

0	if theres one thing i just cant stand  its a film that oozes with sentimentality  heres a note to all film makers  films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves  swelling  saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy  and that the situation is hopeless  alas  my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up  what reminded me was that i wasnt choked up  or even the slightest bit moved  for that matter  my giant is a forced  contrived  and conspicuously uncute  i detest the word  cute  but ive chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a  cute  film here   it takes a premise that might have been interesting  i liked the preview   and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches  all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience  maybe it will work for some people  it didnt work for me  billy crystal plays sam cayman  an agent who  at the beginning of the film  is in romania  hes in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film  the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired  get in a car accident  and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall  his name is max  gheorghe muresan   and sam thinks hed be a great movie star because of his size  subplots are as follows  sam has a son and a wife  kathleen quinlan   and hes never around for them  so they move to chicago  max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins  sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money  and so their various subplots can all be resolved  sam is broke  max is dying  pass the kleenex  my giant  as a comedy  is only moderately funny  it has its moments  the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself  in one great scene  sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal  of course  his son doesnt believe that hes actually speaking to seagal  and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is  i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect   crystal is always entertaining  and he has a few good lines here  some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely   often  however  hes countered by a slew of jokes that arent funny  and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes  muresan is kind of fun to watch  but he just cant act very well  quinlan  on the other hand  is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents  she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown  but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff  here  the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent  all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that  for much of its running time  is simply mediocre  as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion  however  director michael lehmann  who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk  and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable  each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings  sams multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed  how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family    later  it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sams reunion with his family  and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing  but i had a few morality problems with it  and i apologize for being vague   its icky  it drips with gooey  wannabe human emotions  my giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film  more importantly  it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is  instead  its a complicated  overlong  and underengaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears  and since it left me feeling completely unmoved  i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world  
1	a backdrop of new years eve in 1981 would seem to lend itself to a great party movie  the decor possibilities are endless  disco balls had yet to migrate into the dark corners of the attic  big hair was worth its weight in aquanet  and the louder the fashion  the better the look  but despite this setting  these details and a soundtrack that includes some 40plus irresistible hits from the early days of the me decade  something is inherently wrong with  200 cigarettes   a better title for this nostalgic mess would be  50 missed opportunities   what is it that makes this retrocomedy such a downer  its certainly not the cast  which includes enough hot  young talent for several movies  theres courtney love  cementing her reputation as a serious actress  christina ricci  hot off her shouldabeennominated turn in  the opposite of sex   paul rudd  who gets even more appealing with every role  kate hudson  inheriting some fine acting genes from mom goldie hawn  and affleck brothers ben and casey  two of the best things about  good will hunting   perhaps the question is this  what drew these and other immensely talented actors to such a dreary project  maybe it looked good on paper    200 cigarettes  is composed of a series of vignettes  as various characters make their way through new yorks festively decorated east village to a holiday bash thrown by a jittery bundle of nerves named monica  martha plimpton  all dressed up in her best cyndi lauper   among the potential guests are likeable cad kevin  rudd  and his best friend lucy  love   busy bickering over his recent breakup  and a clumsy but seemingly charming bartender  ben affleck  who opens his mouth only to spew forth bad pickup lines  more subplots  many more  dot the big picture  but those listed above are the only ones worth noting in a positive light  all the other story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying to solve a rubicks cube  ricci and gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals  the kind that have trouble pronouncing hard consonants  out to have a high time in the big city  infamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts to a severalscene cameo  hudson  as a prettyinpink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies man  jay mohr   trips  pukes and gets smeared with dog poop  are we laughing yet  the film boils down to a mixture of the good  the bad and the gaudy  with the latter two overtaking the former  game performances  especially by love  rudd and plimpton  are almost shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts and a constantly roving focus  here a combination that mostly sputters when it should crackle  too many sidetracks rate as uninteresting and have little payoff until a lengthy final montage where we find out many of the performers served as one night stands for each other  if this is  200 cigarettes   then get me 200 nicotine patches

0	after the press screening of  moulin rouge   i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues  everyone seemed a bit numb  understandable after sitting through a barrage of oftenincongruous sounds and images  a pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it  another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production  while a woman who flatout hated the movie gave him the skunk eye  when one fellow quietly stated  ive never really been a fan of musicals   the statement surprised me because  even though the story is told almost completely through song  i didnt think of it as a musical  there is so much going on in  moulin rouge  that  musical  seems too small a term to cover it    moulin rouge  is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience  australian director baz luhrmann  the man behind  strictly ballroom  and  romeo  juliet   fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork  opulent imagery and songs ranging from  the sound of music  to  smells like teen spirit   sumptuous and beautiful  vulgar and overdone   moulin rogue  travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on the  random  setting  oh  and it has a story as well    it was 1899  the summer of love      christian  ewan mcgregor  is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris   to write about truth  beauty  freedom and love   where he encounters a group of bohemians  led by henri de toulouselautrec  john leguizamo   christian meets satine  nicole kidman   a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue  and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor  at once fragile and vivacious  the dazzling redhaired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying  christian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well  which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession  working with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler  jim broadbent   christian writes an opus modestly named  spectacular spectacular   zidler quickly finds a backer  the wealthy duke of monroth  richard roxburgh   but theres a catch  the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine  as if all that isnt enough  satine has a cough  and while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold  it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie land  like a teetertotter   moulin rogue  moves up and down between the ridiculous and the sublime  one of the loveliest moments comes as christine and satine commune outdoors at night  becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales  together they dance  while serenaded by the man in the moon  alessandro safina provides the vocals   apparently transported from the classic georges m  li  s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky  other scenes merely traffic in everythingandthekitchensink overload  the cavorting of toulouselautrec and his comrades gets strained at times and some of their overt comedy  accompanied by cartoon sound effects  is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like  bewitched  beat into the ground  of course  sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind    we never heard from baz to turn it down   one of the actors told the los angeles times    it was always  more  more    the director even sent a note to his cast reading   i dare you to make me say youve gone too far   the musical numbers reflect his attitude  one knockout piece  the  elephant love medley   incorporates the beatles  all you need is love   u2s  in the name of love   dolly partons  i will always love you  and elton john and bernie taupins  your song   need more  how about  diamonds are a girls best friend  spiced with portions of  material girl   luhrmanns cast offers a wide variety of approaches that  together  add up to something messy  but often wonderful  ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian  emphasizing the sincerity of the lovestruck poet  mcgregors singing voice is robust and adds vigor at just the right moments  once labeled the  ice queen   nicole kidman melts that characterization with a sizzling  yet tender  performance  she handles the songs adroitly  although her voice sounds a bit thin in the upper range  veteran character actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler  wait until you see him perform  like a virgin   as the buffoonish duke  richard roxburgh proves to be the films weakest link  although im sure he was simply following instructions  i suspect  moulin rogue  will be one of those loveitorhateit films  while i didnt completely love it  i most certainly liked it a lot  over the course of a year  i see well over 300 movies  and most of them look like xeroxes of each other    moulin rogue  is an original  and an original  even a flawed one  is a thing to be cherished  
1	note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  be forewarned    all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts   excerpt from as you like it  act ii  scene 7 when william shakespeare penned this passage  he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent  or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash  this is the world of today  and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical highconcept project like the truman show  truman burbank  jim carrey  seems to have the perfect life  he has a pretty  doting wife meryl  laura linney   a comfortable insurance sales position  an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven  a reliable childhood buddy marlon  noah emmerich   except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia  this is paradise  or so it would seem  bizarre  inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in trumans life  a lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky  a rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term isolated follows him around  a radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move  for the first time in his life  it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be  the truman show  directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol  is a remarkably wellconstructed film  paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next  balancing drama with humour  thoughtfulness with abandon  this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy  in many ways  mr  niccols screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca  both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity  with pivotal  characterdefining moments occurring at sea  although the films rather conventional climax doesnt sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first twothirds  and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch  there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception  despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film  it remains foremost a finelycrafted piece of entertainment  constantly light and accessible  the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude  and as the carefullystacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down  the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false  the end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable  crowdpleasing underdog vs  the system formula  while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept  some elements are lacking  the device of mysterious laurensylvia  natascha mcelhone  as a contributing impetus to trumans growing awareness isnt exactly convincing  theres not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves  and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff  ed harris  with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience  thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film  in fact  although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside trumans artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers  it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even  more  deeply in the insulatory seahaven world  with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling  still  the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target  and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright antivoyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city  ive always believed that the versatile ms  linney possesses a tremendous comic gift  she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes  and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character  mischievously flashing a glazed  insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans  cheerfully going over the top  its hilarious to watch her  who would have ever guessed that shed have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film  ms  linney is a delight in the film  but it is mr  carrey who rules the show here  he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank  the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts  but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal  its difficult not to root for truman  in a commanding performance  mr  carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence  and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn  demonstrating admirable restraint  theres an early scene where hes down on his knees gardening  and given his past track record  one almost instinctively anticipates mr  carrey to pull one of more infamous  and in this case  wholly inappropriate sight gags  its almost poetic how this notorious lookatme actor successfully tones it down to play a character whos constantly the centre of attention  in addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast  mr  emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness  the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating trumans antiseptic  white picketfenced smalltown utopia  and by burkhard dallwitzs original score  technical credits are firstrate all around  while the truman show is clearly a definitive highconcept film  its not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one  obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound  ranging from 1965s secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner  all the same  this is a visionary  awardcalibre film  entertaining  provocative  and intelligent  the curious  and possibly disturbing  thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the films concept seems unfathomably outrageous  its abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching  if not actualisation  at least permissiveness of such a scenario  perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr  weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question  perhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world  
1	warning  spoilers are included in this review    but it doesnt really make much of a difference  deep impact begins the official summer movie season  and it also brings back memories of 1997  remember when dantes peak came out in february  a few months later  volcano was released  the first film was smart  exhilirating  and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen  the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent  well  its deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition  this time  unfortunately  the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon  the upcoming cometdisaster to be released the beginning of july  of course  the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine  and so i am in the minority  as i was when i stood on the side of dantes peak  but while watching deep impact  i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film  apparently many did  and it utterly baffles me  to be completely honest  i havent had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life  volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo  but it was still rather fun to watch  deep impact doesnt just have implausibilities  it also contains cheap human drama  incredibly horrible special effects  and a poorly constructed plot  the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters  deep impact begins in an unnamed year  the year varies  advanced technology sets it in the future  but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater  pushing it back to 1993   a line of students is outside at night  peering through telescopes at the dark sky above  among these are leo biederman  elijah wood  and sarah hotchner  leelee sobieski   leo unknowingly discovers a comet  and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer  who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds  he races off to mail the information  but is killed in a reckless car accident  a year passes  and nothing is heard about it again  we are then introduced to jenny lerner  t  a leoni   a reporter for msnbc  she gets handed a job to investigate a possible coverup in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse  james cromwell   she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie  after talking with rittenhouse  and unsatisfied with the information she gets  she decides to use the internet for help  luckily  she knows exactly how to spell the certain  ellie  that she is looking for  they spell it ele in the film    that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled   before she can use the information  the government decides to push her car off the road  they take her in to meet the president of the united states  president beck  morgan freeman   beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference  naturally  she wants to be compensated  and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question  and so  yada yada yada  they reveal the comet to the public and their plans  send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive  they announce a plan called  ark   which is their only hope for survival  a computer will select 800  000 people at random  these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet wont kill off the entire human race  after two years  the dust will settle  actually  it would take much  much longerapproximately ninety years  from what i understand  and the humans could come back to the surface and start over  the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures  but there is one subplot worth mentioning  jenny and her father  jason  maximilian schell   have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom  the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional  its a shame that nothing else is heartfelt  now  of course  we all know that the comet does impact the surface  the title alone suggests it  and the previews actually show it  by doing this  absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it wont work  director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show  er   her major film debut was the peacemaker  a pathetic and heartless action film  well  this time leder outdid herself  creating a film worse than that one  suggestion to ms  leder  please  stay away from the big screen  or at least the action genre  much of the blame can be placed on leder directly  because the pace is disastrously off  throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed  it goes from months to weeks to hours   it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in realtimeits that boring  of course  leder isnt all to blame for it  screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time  what starts out promising soon turns deadly  for the audience anyway   chock full of cheesy one liners   you know  you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school    and stupid characters  you might think we were back in the 70s again  only one of the subplots is remotely interesting  while the rest are forgettable and boring  and the main plot is so outrageous that you cant figure out if this film is supposed to be an action  drama  or scifi  to put it simply  the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation  thats right  80 miss  and 20 hit  scenes above the earth are well done  and the orbiting ship is majestic  but the comet is a huge mistake  making it more laughable than frightening  the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough  but thats forgiveable  what isnt forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface  give me a break  will ya  and of course  the much hyped collision of comet and earth  well  it is far from spectacular  and it makes independence day look brilliant  the water rushing towards the land is effective  but once it hits the continent  the effects turn ridiculous  cgi water is used  and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks  in fact  i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days  just when we think visual effects cant be improved  along comes a film to show that they really can and should be  one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leders direction  which also influences the actors  leder loves to show the actors faces before and during moments of terror  this reminded me of another action director  renny harlin  die hard 2  cliffhanger   but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations  leder likes to flaunt peoples fears via their faces  but instead of coming off as sympathetic  leder seems more of a sadist  one moment has an astronaut flying off into space  this should be enough to warrant a response from the audience  but leder wants to go farther and shows us the persons face while drifting into space  this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience  and i  for one  am not going to be fooled  on another note  leders film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts  the pace does pick up  and some very emotional moments are shown  then again  when you watch people cry for their loved ones  its obvious it will be emotional  its mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into  feeling  for the characters  but it didnt work for me  but anyway  the actors do as much as they can with what they are given  t  a leoni  bad boys  tvs  the naked truth   is the best of the film  and she is given the meatiest role  her character is made stronger by leonis presence  and we grow to care for her  robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch  but his character is turned into shreds by the plot  elijah wood also comes off rather successfully  but he still hasnt had many good roles  wood  stick to drama  you are too talented for this stuff   vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable  and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen  maximilian schell is distracting  but he does provide some nice humor  morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this  and gives one of his most shallow performances to date  which is quite remarkable for him   leelee sobieski could have been better  but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character  a special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby  eldard is good in his role  but is limited by the plot  crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tvs  star trek  the next generation   seeing her was one of the highlights of the film  overall  a very talented cast virtually wasted  deep impact is rated pg13 for disaster related elements and brief language  this is one of the worst films of the year  and if it is any omen of things to come  this summer could be one of the worst ever  luckily  the xfiles movie is coming up  and hopefully armageddon will be more successful  its a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isnt worth much  costing nearly 75 million  with special effects done by the illustrious ilm  which is a huge shocker   and with a score composed by oscarwinner james horner  titanic   one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience  well  its not  when the comet does hit the earth  you almost wish it could just take this film along with it  
1	stendhals syndrome  a condition where  in the presence of art  a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression  suicidal behaviour and personality disorder  grim stuff  to be sure  but the subject of a remarkable film from italys master of the horror thriller dario argento  boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone  the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento  it follows his disappointing american debut trauma  1992   the patchy opera  1987  and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980s  based on the novel by graziella magherini  the film stars argentos daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapistkiller  visiting florence to follow up several leads  she is lured by the killer alfredo  thomas kretschmann  to an art gallery  a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail  at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints  posing as a bystander  alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer  a strange game of cat and mouse begins  a gripping story evolves  and a coherent one  too  which may surprise those familiar with argentos often lumpy narratives  the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cophuntingkiller scenario  it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central characters psychological disintegration  the script explores its psychosexual themes with intelligence and candour  perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers  but as dark as its themes are  the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years  argento is once again working in his native italy  and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences  effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here  and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent  the films opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination  flashback and realtime with tremendous style  proof that  at his most inspired  argento remains one of the worlds most exhilarating filmmakers  the cast is generally good  though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless  asia argentos performance is by turns risky  awkward and fascinating  its a difficult role  and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts  thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo  and marco leonardi  of cinema paradiso  and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy  does okay as annas work colleague and increasingly confused love interest  but perhaps the stendhal syndromes single most striking element is ennio morricones soundtrack  active since the 1960s  morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts  its mostly a variation on the one theme  a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary  haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards  its been three decades since argento and morricone worked together  this is a long welcome reunion  if the film has a fault  it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesnt quite reach a completely satisfying climax  but by the closing scenes  the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argentos career    note  see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can  dubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web  
1	perhaps its time for me to say a little about my reading habits  i really do like to read  and ive enjoyed many books in my lifetime  my problem is that im a slow reader  and not very dedicated  ill enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time  its taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina  even though im loving the book   in addition to this  i typically dont read anything created after the 19th century  the only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting  time after time  that i havent read any of the books on which these films are based  the only exception  i believe  is great expectations   however  i dont think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film  needless to say  i havent read the elmore leonard novel out of sight  on which steven soderberghs new film is based  i cant say how faithful of an adaptation it is  or if it lives up to leonards vision  i can say that its a terrific film  with sharp acting  great dialogue  and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh  its certainly a nice distraction from 1998s lineup of brainless blockbusters  all hopelessly wishing that size mattered  out of sight proves that it doesnt  i had originally written george clooney off as a onenote actor  incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair  after seeing his latest performance in this film  ive changed my mind  this guy can act  but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those 20 million superstars  here  he plays jack foley  a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living  he does it because its fun  i think  but the film opens with him getting caught because his car wont start  he goes to jail  which is interesting  only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend  buddy  ving rhames   were then introduced to karen sisco  jennifer lopez   a u  s  marshall who  conveniently  is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes  fortunately  they take her hostage  and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety  the central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another  though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible  we soon learn that the film is not told in sequence  and  since this is a gritty crime comedy  flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise   at first  i kind of felt that it was a gimmick  but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction  too  its a fun gimmick  though  and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally  ive only seen a few of soderberghs films  i was impressed both with kafka and sex  lies  and videotape   but i think hes excellent at what he does  hes an artist without making it obvious  and without being pretentious  which is always admirable  he uses tricks  yes  lots of freezeframe stuff here   but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film  as i said  clooney is terrific  and hes matched by lopez  lopez is  of course  beautiful  but she can act  too  i can sense that shes honing in on her skills  for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures  not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome uturn   the two actors have arresting chemistry with one another  the best scene in the film  by far  is the seduction scene  the brilliance of this scene is also due  in part  to soderbergh  for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later  the scene is a series of soft nuances and glances  layered upon light dialogue  and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema  meaningful and engrossing  the supporting cast is strong  led by the alwaysreliable ving rhames  dennis farina  who plays karens father  is good  as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain  steve zahn  who plays jacks nearlybrain dead accomplice glenn  steals all of his scenes  and thats in a film where every scene is already at a high level   all of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligentlyconstructed script by scott frank  out of sight is certainly a light film  although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory  overall  i can recommend it simply as great entertainment  not every film has to change your life  and its nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story and simply to entertain its viewers  as for the book  this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at  
0	soldier is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesnt have jean claude van damme in it  i could liken it to the scifi cheese that was the hollywood productofchoice back in the early 80s  but that would be too much of a compliment  if there is a movie theater in hell  this film is playing there 24 hours a day  the story  such that there is  revolves around todd  kurt russell   an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a nottoodistant ultraconservative future  is there any other kind   after years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him  todd becomes a ground fighter in a series of wars all over the galaxy  who the enemies in these wars are is never revealed  but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesnt matter  because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys  after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash  yes folks  theres more  we see todd as a buff  scarred adult  now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat  theres a new wrinkle  though  todd and his brethren are declared obsolete  and a new batch of soldiers takes their place  after losing a sanctioned battle with dragons jason scott lee  the seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying icecube tray  well  thats what is looked like  on a remote garbage planet  if you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet  and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them  youre way ahead of the game  the renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you halfexpect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute  its surprising that soldier is the brainchild of blade runner cowriter david webb peoples  unlike that mindtwisting classic  this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three doublespaced pages  add into the mix the mortal kombats paul anderson inept direction  and its easy to see how soldier turned out so bad  and the special effects  remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars  gary busey is in this movie  nuff said  soldier is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults  that this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all  now if youll excuse me  i have to go weep for the future  
1	in my opinion  a movie reviewers most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion  but with soul survivors  im so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous  uncontrollable rant  obligations damned  however  protocol forces me to do otherwise  soul survivors tells the story of four collegebound friends  cassandra  melissa sagemiller  is sweet and innocent  party girl annabel  eliza dushku of bring it on  is dating worldweary harvard student matt  wes bentley   matt still has feelings for cassie  who is now dating sean  casey affleck   driving back from a creepy  gothic party  the quartet gets into a horrific car crash  sean dies  leaving cassie crestfallen and guilty  made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her  as cassie mopes through her classes  she sees the ghost of sean all over the place  urging her to follow him  along with being plagued by other ghastly visions  cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party  annabel and matt try calming her down  but no one shares casss visions  she has to figure out this purgatory all by herself  rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material  in his directorial debut  steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion  when the movies camerawork isnt pedestrian  its clich  d  carpenters need for closeups  his camera following sagemiller from behind  drain the movie of any anticipation  we already know what to look for  so why should we be surprised  and the sense of scary atmosphere  which was recently done so well in the others  is nowhere to be found here  carpenters script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness  this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character  which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around  the second lamest device  of course  is the   oh  it was all a dream  resolution  and guess what  this movie has both  not that the main body of the film  which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown  is anything worthwhile  since theres no captivating dialogue  no character chemistry exists anywhere  thats a huge problem  since the four main characters are supposed to be couples  carpenter cant even get the smutty scenes right  which are becoming more prevalent in pg13 movies like bring it on and get over it  the film was recently recut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats  ed   when sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club  he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael baystyle quick cuts  and when sagemiller and dushku take a shower together after getting covered in paint  theyre fully clothed  regardless  any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity  why wouldnt they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine  why would they shower in their clothes  what if they werent covered in latex paint  the cast  which will see better material in the future  would be wise to leave this one off their resumes  i felt sorry for affleck  who ive liked in other movies  and bentley  who was great in american beauty  dushku  who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality  has got to stop taking roles belonging to rose mcgowan  as for sagemiller  star of the aforementioned get over it   i want to see her in a movie where she plays a person  and not an object for gawking  and im not even getting into luke wilsons role as a priest  at least hes friends with wes anderson  bottom line  soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it  
0	the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes  with everything ranging from  l  a  confidential  to  palmetto  to  the big lebowski   has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran  talented directors  with this particular genre  directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lowerclass and the glamorous  opulent upperclass  while maintaining the noirish  ambiguous ambience  the staple of film noir    wild things  could be classified as a black comedy  a sultry film noir or a plain ol erotic thriller  but the one category it doesnt qualify for is that of a quality motion picture  overacted  overwrought and overlong   wild things  is a confused mess  a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too  with its incalculable twists  turns  more twists and more turns  it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness  in spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon  who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal   wild things  not once jells in its eroticism  unpredictability  character motivation  sense of the world  plot  etc  theres not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical  directed by john mcnaughton   henry  portrait of a serial killer     wild things  follows sam lombardo  matt dillon   a hunkish  suburban florida high school teacher whos the dream of every spruced up female in the community  particularly one  kelly van ryan  denise richards  adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner  soon  her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike  enabling her to come into his house  next thing  she cries rape  and the socalled  rollercoaster ride  ensues  a second accuser comes front  suzie toller  neve campbell   a boozedrinkin  tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her  virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions  asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen  even bill murray gets into the act as lombardos zany lawyer  he wears a fake neck brace  waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray  you can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role  as ridiculous as it sounds  hes the most sane character in the movie  the community is astonished  reporters flee to the scene  theres an 8  5million settlement for a libel suit against kellys mother  theresa russell   theres the ambiguous cop  kevin bacon  who also executive produced  who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit  murder and lust  we  the audience  sniff something not so lustful  like so many thrillers these days  including  the usual suspects  and  the game    wild things  eschews character for plot  mcnaughton knows how to handle the camera  and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease  as if he knows the territory hes covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany  henry   a furious  unsettling film directorial tour deforce  george clintons score is a delight to behold  but its the humans  the characters are mere devices for the  nasty  twists  what writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving  almost unbearable  if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting  dont feel real or we dont care for them  not even the unintentionally funny moments work  the people in  wild things  are not so much people as they are caricatures  then theres the erotic content  which nearly earned the film an nc17  for a sexless  badly edited  poorly lit menageatrois  and in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country  kevin bacons member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go  ironically  the wildest elements of  wild things  are not wild at all  
0	the u  s  army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done  one particular field manual is known as the fm 225  which among other things  covers the practice of saluting  under the  saluting  section is a subsection which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer  the salute is rendered by the highestranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail  and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail  in any event  the salute is rendered only by the man  or woman  in charge  rather than by the whole group  almost at the very beginning of the generals daughter  we see a generals motorcade passing a work detail  everyone salutes  it looked impressive  but it just wasnt right  that little bit showed me that someone either didnt do the appropriate research  or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene  in fact  this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture  as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie  what results is a film that looks good  but like that one scene  just isnt right  the first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example  paul brenner  john travolta  is an agent for the armys criminal investigation division  undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale  prior to the transaction  the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isnt the unscrupulous supply sergeant hes supposed to be  and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living  so ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark  well just say that it involves propellers   brenner then receives new orders when the commanding generals daughter  captain elisabeth campbell  leslie stefanson   is found naked  bound  and dead on one of the bases training ranges  he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill  madeleine stowe  to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder  what i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary  it gives no insight into brenner  other than the fact that hes a little cocky  does the arms subplot turn up later  no  so why add this extra running time to the film  the answer  it looked cool  or how about the  atmosphere   the beginning of the generals daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south  thick trees  dirt roads  sultry colors over water  all backed up with bayouesque music  nice immersion in the setting  but it soon doesnt matter  for when the films plot shifts over to the murder investigation  so does the entire mood  no attention is paid to the location of the story  and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme  did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie  instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film  we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another  just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside  the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie  as ive already mentioned  an entire section of the film doesnt jibe with the rest  and the characterization only adds to the difficulty  brenner  who comes across as a man with little respect for authority  suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell  james cromwell  and utters some of the corniest  yes  sir  s ive ever heard  he even delivers an emotioncharged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the generals daughter  even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous  sunhill  who initially comes across as a professional investigator  utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information  and even revels in her ingenuity  both characters are protagonists  but its hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place  and in some cases  simply unappealing  i could imagine that during filming  west would shoot a scene  then take the actors aside and tell them   lets do it again  but this time  i want more   i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good  in this film they overact in most of their scenes  an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the generals aide  colonel fowler  i swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention  a far cry from his days as linc in  the mod squad   i cant help but think he was acting from wests direction  a couple of side characters including a west point psychologist  john beasly  and a young female private  ariyan a  johnson  make their scenes nearly impossible to bear  the only two actors who seem to have escaped wests influence are james woods  who provides a good performance as colonel moore  elisabeths mentor at the psychological operations unit  and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police  woods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with peoples minds  and does so without ever taking it over the top  hutton just kind of hangs around  but at least he wasnt overacting  i havent read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based  but ill bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form  the movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space  or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished  every time were presented with some new aspect to the case  west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like its the most momentous discovery ever  but the information is not used by the investigators at all  instead  when conclusions are drawn  they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts  but lucky guesses instead  the army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill  letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects  then letting them guess who the killer was  wouldve been over in a half hour  the film finishes with a sort of bookend  featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning  literally during the closing credits  we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off  then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off  they both seem kind of happy  maybe they were driving away from simon west

0	  meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood    screams the television ads for  hanging up   disastrously written by reallife sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton  make me laugh again  not only is  hanging up  misadvertised  since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan and gives her two costars  lisa kudrow and diane keaton  little more than extended cameos  but they dont actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minutes  and we are supposed to believe their strong bond  and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship  despite them being apart for the majority of the running time  excuse me  again  while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion  eve marks  meg ryan  is the middle mozzell sister  still living in the california town where she grew up  and with a husband  adam arkin  and preteen son  jesse james   her elderly  wisecracking father  lou  walter matthau  in his brightest performance in years  has just recently been put into the hospital  in the final stages of what i assume is alzheimers  even though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong with him   while eves relationship with her mother  cloris leachman  is nearly nonexistent  since she ran out on lou and her children years ago  she has had her fair share of ups and downs with lou  who used to be an alcoholic  her older sister is georgia  diane keaton   an editor for the selftitled magazine   georgia   while maddy  lisa kudrow  is the youngest  a soap opera actress  interestingly  their professions are given  but we not once ever see them working at their jobs  or  for that matter  learn much of anything about them  maddy  georgia  and eve do not see each other much anymore  their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart  but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another  and they talk  and talk  and talk    in fact  the telephone is the major star of the film  even more so than ryan  as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long  if you are able to get through the opening halfhour  in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them  you will surely survive the rest  the question is  who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating  selfinvolved patontheback  how could a comedydrama that has the starpower of meg ryan  lisa kudrow  and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways  issues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up  but the film isnt mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner  and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood  it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought  also  it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another  but no dynamic metamorphosizes  and when they do reunite in the finale  their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying threeminute scene in which they argue like little children  you can see the impending death coming a mile away  and it conveniently occurs in the next scene  so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves  and with each other  you think to yourself   the only thing left for them to do is have a playful foodfight   and like clockwork  it also occurs by the end credits  meg ryan is a versatile actress  look no further than 1998s  hurlyburly  or 1994s  when a man loves a woman    despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies  with  hanging up   the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron  a writerdirectorhack who shouldnt be allowed to work in hollywood again after this bigbudget  highprofile debacle  even if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department  she nonetheless is very good  and the two scenes that work  flashbacks to christmas 1988  when she had a heartbreaking runin with her mother  and to halloween 1993  when lou crashed her sons birthday party in a drunken stupor  are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations  diane keaton  as georgia  is better as an actress than a director here  but that is a wildly feeble compliment  what is more than a little farfetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow  although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children  she is no more than five years ryans senior  yeah  right  lastly  poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in a bigscreen venture  after her even more thin role in 1999s  analyze this   kudrow isnt given enough time to create a full personality with maddy  so it isnt her fault she doesnt register until a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue  if anything  though  kudrow is a real talent  and i anxiously await the next time she is given a role more deserving of her time  as in her brilliantly nuanced  oscarcaliber work in 1998s  the opposite of sex   if you are a fan of kudrows  and who isnt    do yourself a favor and rent this gem that puts more good use to kudrow in sixty seconds than  hanging up  does in its entirety  as eves hardworking husband  adam arkin is  predictably  squandered with a role that gives him next to nothing to do  until a subplot reveals itself midway through  only to never be mentioned again  cloris leachman  as with ryan and matthau  makes a small  but noticeable impression with her  albeit  very brief appearance  while edie mcclurg  as a rosycheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas 1988 flashback  manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production  nearly all the emotions displayed within  hanging up  are patently manufactured  and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the characters  aside from eve  why would you want to when they are all spoiled brats  if  for some bizarre   twilight zone  type of reason  you find yourself in a movie theater showing this film  my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credits are over  saying it is a waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions  
0	just look back two years ago at the coen brothers comedic gem the big lebowski  change the actors  take away the bowling alley  add a record store  and youve got high fidelity  or maybe the other way around since nick hornbys novel high fidelity came first   either way  its been done before  a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances  yet it remains consistently funny  why is this  maybe because you know your life is much better than this  you know these guys are more pathetic than you are  and you know its ok to laugh at them because theyre fictional  director stephen frears  possibly not intentionally  has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day  when watching high fidelity  expect to laugh at someone elses pain  realize what you are laughing at  and then laugh again  i laughed at dick  todd louiso   the shy  timorous  steve buscemi character of lebowski  who seems to know what he is talking about but either cant put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends  i laughed at the john goodman character barry  jack black   an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons  pudgy  egotistic  and obnoxious at the same time  and i laughed at rob  john cusack   the jeff bridges type  whom the story revolves around  rob is the character easiest to relate to  but he is nothing like you at all  he uncontrollably cheats and lies  then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman  and like his other miserable friends  pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort  he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it  whatever human emotions the clash  aretha franklin  and bruce springsteen records hold  rob and co  grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives  rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in  during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on  rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him  but these arent any girlfriends  these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob  robs incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life   the plot in three words is  women and music  the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective  it gives high fidelity a quickly paced  informal structure  adjectives which perfectly parallel robs own lifestyle  it also helps open the viewers eyes as to how annoying barry is  jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball  just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob  who must work with him every day of the week  what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes  john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast  consisting of big stars and character actors  that really defines rob  now instead of rob just talking to the camera  after he explains something  the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say  the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesnt end when it should have ended  instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that  also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie  high fidelity is a cheerful  old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs  i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen  they make everyone look and feel great

0	the reunion film is not an original idea in any way  shape  or form  its been done throughout film history over and over again  and has become one of the many subgenres  like the prep school subgenre  the angstfilled teen subgenre  and the slasher subgenre  what makes  peters friends  so remarkable is not how it doesnt follow the rules of this subgenre  but how it follows it so well  and creates characters that i wouldnt mind hanging with  what are the rules of the reunion subgenre  well     1  you need a group of friends  most of them married or at least dating  and sometimes even married or dating eachother  2  you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis  3  they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart  4  the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10  5  they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic  6  the reunion has to bring them together  seperate them with little crises  then bring them back together because  after all  theyre friends  7  there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited  8  eightly  theyre all unhappy or marginally so  9  theres some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them thats built up over the years  10  the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts  sometimes internationally so  11  the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends  sometimes causing them to get together in dancesong  since it follows these rules so closely  it will probably be  and has been  coined off as just a  british big chill    and in some ways it is  both follow the rules  as i said  and both feature lots of bitching  big confessionals  and broken relationships  but while  the big chill  was  at least to me  a tad too whiny and unsatisfying   peters friends  hits its mark  making this film funny  dramatic  and poignant  the friends of peters were all in the same theatre group back in 82  performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them  the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus   after peters  stephen fry  wealthy father  richard briers  hardly on screen enough to register  but oh well  dies  leaving a giant mansion to him  he has to decide whether or not to keep it  not sure what to do with it immeadiately  he decides to throw a giant reunion party  inviting back all his old chums  of course  all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule  andrew  kenneth branagh  also directing here  is an actor whos unhappily married to a tv star  carol  cowriter rita rudner   maggie  emma thompson  is a successfuly publisher of selfhelp books  but looks like she needs them more than her customers  as she is lonely and unhappy  roger and mary  hugh laurie and imelda staunton  who were also married in  sense and sensibility   are married  and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk  but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died  and sarah  alphonsia emmanuel  is as promiscuous as ever  having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian  tony slattery  whos married and wants a divorce because of her  giving her doubts  as for peter  things seem okay    the film features lots of innerfriend jokes  and even some old theatre anecdotes  which i at least find a lot of fun in  as ive done lots of theatre myself   and there are big confessions  brawls between the friends  and by the end  almost everyone is unhappy  even though some have resolved their problems long before the end  which i kinda dug   the final twist would seem forced an anticlimactic  but for some reason  i felt the same way the rest of the friends did  maybe its because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique  thats really what makes  peters friends  so lovable  the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes  but when someones in crisis  can come together wonderfully for one another  its when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends  and these people are true friends  not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s  a decade i grew up in  unfortunately  without taking us outside of the 90s  there are some 80s classics and anticlassics like tears for fears  everybody wants to rule the world   but unfortunately no stupidfun 80s songs  i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film  id put some crap go gos song on  or at least some good old  come on eileen    but this is the british 80s were talking about  oh well  but anyway  the direction is pretty good  although nothing amazing  branaghs forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical  but at least hes very good with making a less ambiguous film like this  the writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman  with lots of good oneliners  and even some really bad but good puns  to mock the fact that andrew lives in l  a   peter  while cutting some logs  asks him is he has wood in l  a   and andrew says   no  but we have hollywood   punishment like that   the actors  as in most speaking movies  are better than their material  though  with some standout performances to the six friends  as well as the outsiders like slattery  rudner  and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peters mansion  a little note should be made about hugh lauries performance  as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this  i mean  ive never seen him actually act this dramatically    peters friends  is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion  although i dont know what kind ill have  like most people  i dont look forward to my high school reunion   because of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation  i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that  
1	a documentary from the twin hughes brothers  allen and albert  dead presidents  menace ii society   about street pimps  all of whom are africanamerican  an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession  it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their hos  and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be  is what you get  i learned that the word  bitch  is their favorite word  as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used  it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say  but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about  then some of what they rap about might seem amusing  they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen  in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money  its also a power trip  accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them  mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place  this sleazy pic  soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears  these verbose pimps had a smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face  the hughes brothers used as their pimp role models  the featherhatted  furcoated  diamond ringwearing  gold chain wearing  flashy cadillaccruising pimp of the late 70s blaxploitation movieslike the mack and willie dynamite  also used as reference  was iceberg slims bestseller pimp  the story of my life  we meet pimps such as  fillmore slim  cnote  charm  kred  gorgeous dre  bishop don magic juan  and rosebudd  they readily discuss their business arrangements  including percentages  lifestyles  knockin  stealing another pimps ho   and the thrill they get from women giving them money  these dudes needed no prompting to talk  as they just love to brag about about themselves    priests need nuns   yaps cnote  a san francisco pimp    doctors need nurses  so hos need pimps   as he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make  that the girls need them to show them the ropes  how to make money  to be their security blankets  protectors  and counselors  the race issue was brought up right from the films onset  as a number of white interviewees  regular citizens  note that their impression of a pimp  is that hes the lowest form of human  while  we are told  in the black community  the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur  riding around in fancy cars  flashing wads of money  dressed in a flamboyant style  where his snakegaiter shoes might cost him a grand  and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community  we also see that the black pimps have a number of white girls in their stable and we see how they treat them like dirt  as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery  of master and slave relations  the film was all about pimp style and their projected image  as they run a hardsell riff about the virtues of their work  there are different styles of pimping  but the film mentions them only as being  macks  and  players  or  real pimps  and  perpetrator pimps   but no further clarity is attempted  it is also failed to get the womens side to this story of abuse  primarily taking the pimp at his word  the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does  as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps  who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing  hungry for their 15minutes of fame  the only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture  was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to  danny brown became a blues singer so he could keep his pimps wardrobe  while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd  married his ho and turned square  working to support his wife and daughter as a telemarketer  
0	paul verhoeven  the dutch auteur who dragged his violent  sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film  has never been what id consider a thoughtful director  though some of his films  notably starship troopers  have been lauded as artistic achievements   but he is the kind of hollywood film maker whos managed to  no matter what the budget  make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils  starship troopers was essentially a bmonster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange  a great film thats nearly impossible to find on video  yet showgirls is everywhere   in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins  the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards  who may actually be 45 silicone   in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage  its not a completely successful film  but as a failure its certainly an interesting  and mostly entertaining  one  my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores  spetters  a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the subculture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange  havent yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight   i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop  a bleak superhero satire with a robotic hero thats as touching as schwarzeneggers in t2  that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics  its violence seemed to be there for a purpose  namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread  not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience  theres a jawdropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him  he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victims every fearful tic  its a startling moment of barbaric  maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punknoir  in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just wont shut up  he impales a coworker  drowns another and so on  but why  his character is introduced as a smug genius  the kind whos always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear  sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place  though once the character becomes invisible  this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster  the kind who just wont die  hollow mans protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda  elizabeth shue  acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm  and her lover  a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin whos saddled with the films worst lines   ive lost cohesion again     theyre a typical aaron spelling couple  goodlooking but as vacant as george w  bushs republican national convention speech  i  e  bush referring to clinton      so much promise    but to what end  to what end    this actually got applause  suddenly warren beatty doesnt look so absurd   the rest of the films characters are all well past thirty  though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained oneliners  is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywoods new character developing technique  ahh  what a cynical time we live in    as the picture opens we meet cain  kevin bacon   an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret  so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentations  project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility  for what purpose is never hinted at   theyve performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine  in a twist worthy of the films 1950s late show origins  to impulsively experiment on himself  caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his coworkers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead  our mad scientist is turned invisible  after several fxheavy complications   then he inexplicably  its hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures  but this is never explored  and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human   begins raping  assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases  always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger  it grows abundantly clear with each new release that its verhoevens films that have become hollow  like the rest  this one is cold  heartless  and full of contempt for humanity  but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit  insight and makes no statement other than  audiences will pay for anything these days   its an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level  or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun  thrillaminute ride  verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care  the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick  how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self  a couple weeks ago  after seeing the trailer  a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability  hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa  in a serious manner to boot  but oh yeah  it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway  verhoeven delivers the sleazy  goods   but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner  here it just feels icky and uncomfortable  the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses  caressing their breasts with his lens all while fauxpsycho music strains in the background  its plainly obvious that verhoeven isnt exploring voyeurism  like in the classic peeping tom  but exploiting it and not even doing that very well  its funny that with all the technology 90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a womans naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand  most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks  in fact its largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since  by the end  most of his potential victims don inferred glasses that track his body heat  as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov  a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre   and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked  the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy  it happens when a lab assistant  kim dickens  who looks like she stepped out of playboy  in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon  suddenly pauses    are you looking at me    she queries  obviously haunted  its a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982  the apex of the mad slasher craze   those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer  and theyre the only reason to check out hollow man  preferably as a midweek bargain rental  youve been warned  but you probably wont listen  will you  tis a pity    
1	since 1990  the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style  now  instead of emphasizing feelgood stories replete with characters of noble virtues  the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow  this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times  as 1993s schindlers list shows  most of todays mainstream drama  however  creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience  thats why pictures like october sky  which are a throwback to the good ol dramas of yesteryear  are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema  the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam  jake gyllenhaal   a teenager in the 1950s company town of coalwood  west virginia  its a wellknown fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships  the rest grow up to work in the coal mine  the mine  which is run by homers father  chris cooper   is not the place for homer  however  after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957  homer feels a connection with the outside world  as he puts it   anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did   drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast  homer begins to construct rockets  with the help of their history teacher  miss riley  laura dern   and several mine workers  the four are soon bound for great things  october sky is a skillfully crafted film  and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston  johnston  whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing wellknown titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars  certainly knows what hes doing here  he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust  he does not push any barriers  but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the films charm  his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost  such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers  or the silent struggle between homers mother and father  the cast is well chosen  although the true bright spots are the supporting roles  laura dern  jurassic park  lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher  giving the boys the support and guidance they need  her role is instantly likeable  chris cooper  the horse whisperer   as homers father  is less likeable  even downright despicable at times  but his turn here gives gravity to the movie  hes definitely a driving force in homers life  and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable  the script is generally cheerful  projecting the boys endeavors in a lighthearted manner  there are moments when it becomes predictable  such as the train tracks scene  and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist  it highlights the essence of youth  however  and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps  october sky should be a success with audiences  although it doesnt have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or shes all that  it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards  its a welcome change to the dramatic genre  and one that everyone should see  
1	the ultimate match up between good and evil   the untouchables  is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry  based on the 1959 television show of the same title   the untouchables  may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place  but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences  some excellent acting  a memorable score  and a clever script  the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public  elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order  however  as ness soon learns  in order to stabilize peace  you have to bend a few laws  the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes  the film begins with capone  played perfectly by deniro  declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws  the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capones men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl  from this point we know capone is evil  not only because he kills without hesitation  but also because he is a lying bastard  right from the first five minutes of the film  de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs  this developed hatred is before the films hero  ness  is even introduced  i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone  the film only gets better from this point  with the formation of the untouchables  there is a group of men wearing long  dark overcoats and hats  they walk in unison and they only look forward  as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens  holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals  this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films  one that comes to mind is  the matrix  when neo  morpheus  trinity  and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world  wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930s style  the similarities between these two are countless    the untouchables  has some of the hippest  bravest heroes in any action film  the four members were the only ones willing to go against capones army  each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others  elliot ness  played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner  is a character that surely grows during the course of the film  he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be  however  as the film develops so does ness  his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side  he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends  his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in  sean connery  who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role  plays malone  an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables  malone acts as a mentor to ness  he teaches him  the chicago way  to do things  when they attack with a knife  you attack with a gun  connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed  andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone  a young man who is just becoming a police officer  as ness grows  he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him  charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone  smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film  the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen  also very similar to  the matrix   they are exciting and intense  from a westernlike battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps  the scenes are well thought out and well executed  the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement  its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors  the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective  although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified  this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting  great directing  and great action  some scenes  capone and the baseball bat  the train station  have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid  
0	many people dislike french films for their lack of closure  while possibly shallow  ive often had a desire for a sense of epiphany  or at least a resolution  in the films which i view  there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional  however  the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passiondenying protagonist  stephane  daniel auteuil   stephane  daniel auteuil  is a master violin maker  he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing  even the relationship between he and his boss  maxime  andre dussollier  is a controlled  and almost manipulated association  highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches  in the beginning of the movie  stephane is a closed  solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man  camille kessler  emmanuelle beart  is a master violinist and the new love of maximes  maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife  like stephane  camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved  sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges  when stephane and camille meet  there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals  however  whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane  stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him  stephane ignores his feelings for camille  which the audience cannot help but to see is present  as the movie progresses  the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another  these two people  with very similar approaches to life initially  react to their new circumstance very differently  stephane becomes even more rational and controlled  while camille becomes more tempestuous  until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship  however  their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation  the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well  due to his relationship with a master violin teacher  however  apparently  he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing  consequently  stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays  in contrast  camille had almost given the violin  years earlier  however  with the aid of her manager  she has progressed to being almost one of the worlds finest  successfully submerging herself to her playing  during the course of the movie  we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions  stephane attempts to remain unchanged  however  we do see subtle hints of his transformation  one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash  the development of all of the characters  many of which is not included in this synopsis  is incredible  american movies  with rare exceptions  have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development  in its essence  this movie is about the development and growth of the characters  camille and stephane  the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie  including a death  is to further the development of camilles and stepahnes characters  i am not sure why berardinelli says   at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified  and it is to auteuils credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty   this movie is not about judging stephanes actions as being right or wrong  but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are  i find the ending appropriate  unfortunately  i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling  this portion of the film is where the  sense of closure  could have been successfully accomplished  unfortunately  there is a hurried and almost a soap operatype surge of emotions from all of the characters  while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart  ravel has his day in this film  the synergism of the tension of ravels music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen  the directing in this movie is wonderful  the actors and actresses are excellent  each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth  emmanuelle bearts personality is beautiful  and needless to say  i must say that emmanuelle beart  herself  is beautiful  besides the near ending  the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral  i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of  the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot  has their attitude towards love changed  i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at  but i am unsure of which the director is espousing  in summary  this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship  in the process  we see their attitude towards life and other people  in itself  i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie  where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we  as americans  have preconceived american notions of relationship  love  and people  i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture  however  i  bringing my american preconceptions  enjoyed the film  i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it

1	when i first heard of contact  the hype was building it up as a scifi blockbuster  now  with that in mind  coupled with the knowledge of jodie fosters involvement in the project  i thought  what in the world is foster doing in a scifi blockbuster      as it turned out  my expectations were completely nullified and turned topsyturvy  robert zemeckis  back from the euphoria created by his last film  forrest gump  once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure with along the endearing lines of human spirit  dont get me wrong  contact is scifi  but with a definite difference  based on the late carl sagan novel of the same name  the story delves itself in questions on science and god  fact and faith  allie  foster  is a radio astronomer  she spends her time listening to the stars  via ultrahuge communication dishes in search of intelligent life beyond the solar system  her passion for longdistance communication is the result of her younger days being spent avidly in front of a hamradio system  a hobbyist radio communication device  which her latefather bought for her  a scene which particularly strengthens the audiences view of the passion is when she asked her father whether she could contact her latemother through the hamradio system in which her father replied  not even the most powerful radio in the world can do that  now   allies research is based on the seti project  search for extra terrestrial intelligence   in which she listens to radio emissions from other galaxies in the hope of finding one which would suggest intelligent manipulation  her work has never been off the scrutiny of the us government  which considers it a waste of taxpayers money and politically unviable  her supervisor  tom skerritt  pulls the plug on seti  undaunted  allie managed to gather a loyal group of believers and eventually found funding from a large private corporation  the following months were treacherous to their hopes and research as they are contantly pressured by the government but all that changed when one day  she caught an emission of a seemingly intelligent repeating soundwave  the news of her find attracted hordes of alien believers  cultist  the media and of course  the government  the situation became intense upon her discovery of pictorial plans on building a form of transport which were embedded within the repeating sound emission  as the world join forces to build this transport  allie is desperate to be the one to go  she enrols herself among a few hopefuls  to represent the world when the transport is ready for operation  her eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the presidents spiritual advisor  mcconaughey   allie  being an atheist  a result of her belief in fact and science  refuses to budge upon questioning  at this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the presidents spiritual advisor  a strong point which propelled the movie is the depth of its main characters played by foster and mcconaughey  from the very first meeting scene  it is obvious that the two of them was sort of kindred spirits but they were worlds apart in almost all aspects  foster being a person drawn to science and facts and mcconaughey being one who believes in faith  hope and the power of the unseen  the meeting of their worlds  added with the situation which they are put into makes the entire storytelling process near flawless  many people who read the synopsis of this film would find it a tad too ridiculous  but by actually immersing yourself in it  gives you an entirely different perspective  one which is free from bias and preconceptions  zemeckis and his team of screen writers have done a remarkable job in telling this tale through film  contact works by not delving in controversy but rather  touches the thinking audience  urging them to ponder upon the questions raised in the film concerning fact and faith  whether one can actually find compromise within  i consider contact as one of the mustsees for this year  
1	for this review and more  visit clear illusions  www  clearillusions  com  the majority of scary movies signal the fact that a character is about to meet their demise with cheesy music  worn out dialogue such as  ill be right back   or simply with the overall tone of the scene  how about a classic john denver song as a death signal for a change  thats the kind of bursting originality that allows  final destination  to invade the viewers mind  even days after seeing it  making one pause before ever entering a dark room  taking a shower  or even going to sleep  the unique and horrifying thriller is the best thing to happen to the slasher genre since 1996s  scream     final destination   directed by james wong and penned by jeffrey riddick  glen morgan  and james wong  the latter two being writers for the t  v  series  the xfiles   is a movie with wonderful ideas  and executes them effortlessly  its rare a film of this nature can grab an audiences attention these days  as the genre has seem to be completely worn out   but  final destination  has more in store for one than one can imagine  unlike  halloween  s michael myers or  nightmare on elm street  s freddy kruger   final destination  s killer is of the supernatural  the dark one himself  death  the intriguing premise is as follows  a portion of a senior class is set to travel by air to paris for their class trip  after boarding the plane  one of the students  alex browning  devon sawa  dreams of their plane exploding into flames just after takeoff  killing everyone on board  once waking up  alex gets himself and six others off of that plane  all of who seem to be rather confused by the entire happening  shortly after their departure  the plane takes off  and guess what  it blows up in middair  now  alex  and fellow survivors  who consist of friend clear waters  ali larter   enemy carter  kerr smith   carters girlfriend terry  amanda detmer   the goofy billy  sean william scott  and his brother tod  chad donella   and teacher  ms  valerie lewton  kristen cloke   are in extreme danger  as it seems they have cheated death by getting off of that plane  and now death wants them  the number of survivors starts to peel back quite quickly as death goes around offing those who got off the plane   but who is next  and how will death get them    final destination  is a film that is unbearably suspenseful  always making the viewer frantic  as death will strike in the most unlikely of times  john denvers  rocky mountain high  being played pretty much warrants another death   everyone on that plane learned the hard way  although its usually given whose life will be taken next  the intensity and unpredictability of the film never fades  because you dont know when death is coming  like the characters in the movie  i was constantly nervous and shaky during  final destination   the slightest noise or movement nearby would send me a mile into the air    and yes  the film is that intense  the cast is surprisingly effective and up to par  the best ensemble in this genre since  scream   the characters have multidimensional personalities for a change  and for the most part  you highly sympathize with them once death starts to come their way  devon sawa and ali larter are the main focus of the film  and both actors follow up their well written characters with even better performances  that  like the  scream  movies did for their cast  will launch them into superstardom  kerr smith and kristen cloke are also impressive  although the two dont posses as much screen time as the leads    final destination  is one exhilarating  exciting ride  any age should be able to enjoy the complexity and eeriness of the film  and should find an edge to it that most slasher films lack  for the blood loving moviegoer   destination  contains buckets of blood  guts  and all that good stuff    final destination  is a film that is destined to become a cult classic among horror fans  and a sleeper hit at the box office  hands down to the first film in years that has actually scared me  by scare  i dont mean making me jump  or making me wonder if im in danger  but by scare i mean a film that stays locked in your mind  absorbing you  leaving one question thats constantly on your mind  is death coming for me  the bottom line  make  final destination  your destination  
0	over 40 years ago  a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira  a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankinds nuclear testing  partly flight of fancy  partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry  gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo  a year later  gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things  a new name  a dubbed english track  and raymond burr  as godzilla  the film took on the rest of the world  thirty years later  toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things  yes  including raymond burr  and called it godzilla 1985  now its 14 years after tohos remake  and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run  in emmerichs godzilla  matthew broderick plays dr  niko tatopoulos  a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiationinduced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms  when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river  tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states  meanwhile  tatopouloss college girlfriend  audrey timmonds  maria pitillo   works in new york city as an assistant to a bigtime news reporter  shed like to be a reporter herself  and when godzilla comes ashore  she figures this is her big break  of course  with the big guy running amok in the city  niko and audrey are bound to cross paths  and are joined by victor  animal  palotti  hank azaria   audreys trusty cameraman friend  and phillipe roche  jean reno   an operative for the french government  whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place  together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla  with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nations premiere movie production companies  one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla  he didnt  right up there with the lost world  godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history  the plot is pretty much what we expect  the big dinosaurlike creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city  and its up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped  while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down  the script  however  is painfully bad  its fraught with lines so corny  they dont even belong in bmovies  and includes many character actions which make you think   you idiot   or  you stupid girl   i suppose when youve got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york  any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well  why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them  but is conveniently able to leap atop others  why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him  when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line  why do sidewinder missiles  which have small explosive warheads  blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla  why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f18 fighterbombers  when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two  okay  maybe the last one was a bit nitpicky  but hey  i was on a roll  broderick is usually a good actor  but in this film hes weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way  hank azaria does what he can  but dont expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage  like brodericks  azarias character is quite simply lacking in color  what really annoyed me was maria pitillo  who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting  casting must have been asleep on this one  the one bright spot here is jean reno  who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic  quite unlike what weve seem him do in the past  although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster  reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable  unfortunately  the same cannot be said of the other incongruities  the entire feel of the movie is tongueincheek  and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it  this results in a significant amount of parody  which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster  and ends up just producing a mess  most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief  and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously  although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture  what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens  if we cant take the characters seriously  the threat they face is an empty one because we simply dont care what happens to them  godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more lighthearted than it should be  far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters  but heres a behemoth running through the city  theres bound to be a lot of casualties  but instead godzilla is afflicted with the afterschool g  i  joe cartoon syndrome  where almost everyone seems to get out of harms way just in time  in a couple of scenes  godzilla briefly breathes fire  none of the characters even remark upon this ability  nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers  its as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes  godzilla can do this  just like in the old movie  consider another punch pulled  through creative script writing  you can make a sequel out of just about any movie  but the final scene in this one doesnt just leave the door open  it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently  it made me want to gag  emmerich should have done away with 90 of the humor and injokes and played this one as a straight action film  with an intelligently written screenplay  godzilla could have been so much more  however  by confusing the viewer with a ton of addins and parodies  the movie ends up being something that just doesnt work  now if they only had raymond burr

0	seen april 16  1999 at 10 p  m  at crossgates cinema 18  guilderland  n  y    theater 15  by myself for free using my hoyts critics pass  theater rating     12  very good seats  sound and picture do you realize that every time you encounter a new person youve just become part of a story  everyone has their own life story  both past and present  and every time two or more interact  they become part of each others story  not necessarily an important or even significant part  but a part nevertheless   that seems to be the basic theory behind go   where several characters chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways  in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldnt usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them  such as a teenage supermarket cashier  a bottomofthedrugfoodchain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors  these types of characters might not sound all that original  but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father  a midlevel drug dealer  a narc obsessed with multilevelmarketing  horny wedding guests  a zen lovemaker  two shrimpscarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out  how they will all come together is the process the film deals with  id imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general  the film starts out as anything else  with little indication of whats to come  we meet ronna  polley   a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesnt seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent  shes not very charming  especially to her customers  but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works  maybe this is because shes not a very afeminite character  but shes far from masculine  a creative character indeed  things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy  hyperactive  yet likable simon  askew   an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences  this agreement starts a threepronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug  the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death  nearly the same can be said for two other characters  zack  mohr  and adam  wolf   who we dont think much of when they first appear as supporting characters  but later will become major players to the films makeup  another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be  once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle  when the title screen ronna is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene  its clear this film isnt going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling  considering how good it is up until that point  its a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today  and so the film begins to take shape  first by following ronna and her friends on a onenight adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam  who were actually looking for simon   which doesnt exactly go as planned  but thats what keeps it all so interesting  the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronnas story  but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead  simon and his three friends head to  vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined  the third arc  about zack and adam  again overlaps with ronnas story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle  were shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna  and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam arent even their fault  they just happened to be where they were when they were  id really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end  but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who havent seen the film  perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability  and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay  just through great filmmaking  still  i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well    direction  trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman  its a great accomplishment  he doesnt just depict a story  he wraps us up in it all  pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low    screenplay  besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general  its clear the script has been inspired by many sources  with both obvious and subtle references  yet it never screams ripoff     tonemood  where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream  this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre  its not overlydark or twisted and the comedy isnt so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy  more like macabre light     cinematographyart direction  able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner    characterization  for nearly every character introduced  no matter what role they play in the big picture  were able to get a sense of who they are  what theyre thinking and how they came to be in their situations  even when their actions are surprising  it never seems very out of synch    performances  every actor nails their role  see above     themetheory  the film doesnt seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages  instead  its more of a philosophical experiment

0	i wont even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films  i saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien 3  but i have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them  so take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective  alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard days work  i didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful  most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing  but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning  sigourney weaver  whos role in alien earned her an academy award nomination  plays the character of ripley   who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 3  200 years later  scientists use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley  including the alien that was stuck inside her  in no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two  yet ripley is now not completely human  possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being  im sure someone can explain exactly why this is so  but for now well just ignore it and move on  why  you ask  would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated  well  the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature  these were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research  they  yawn  were wrong  it doesnt take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary unflossed teeth  theres a little saying that goes something like this  if youre going to make a bad film  do it well   i have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies  but they are not the ones that really bother me  alien resurrection  a good example of a film that really gets up my nose  is not so much a discouraging experience but an off putting one  there is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore  which attempts to distract us from the wanderingbutnotgoinganywhere plot  in one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off  another one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to  fair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story  but this is unfortunately not the case  and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable  if you think im struggling to find one good aspect about the film  then you thought right  one exciting scene is a credit  and the only part remotely worth seeing  to the film  in which an alien chases two men  one a cripple  up a tall ladder with interesting results  but of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard  and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis  so in a film where the one liners come as bad as earth man  what a shit hole and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent  its no wonder why alien  resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is  oh  and in case youre wondering about my bag of lollies  the less i enjoy a film  the more i eat  so all the lollies were gone in 15 minutes  but however empty the bag turned out to be  it was still a long way ahead of the movie 
0	theres a 1  000foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact  id say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies  which are getting more irwin allen esque with every release  the early wave of this revival  while just as cheesy and laughable  at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes  deep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama  with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking  the repeating cycle is as follows  the president  morgan freeman  will go on tv and tell the country that theres a remote chance a comet will strike the earth  but that the nations crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem  then we get to see the plan in action  in some sequence utterly lacking suspense  the mission will barely fail  and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth  and theres a remote chance it will strike  but that the nations crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem  it goes on and on throughout the movie  but every time freeman goes on tv  we know his plan is going to fail  how do we know this  because weve seen the tv ads for deep impact  ads that feature freeman telling the nation that  the comet is still headed right for us  and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading  ladies and gentlemen  that is the movie  successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow  but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30second tv spots  television is whats wrong with deep impact  the main character  played by tea leoni  is a lowlevel broadcast journalist for msnbc  and thats the mere tip of the productplacement iceberg  who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy  she thinks its an instance of an exsecretary of something or other  james cromwell  resigning because of a mistress  and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area  when she goes nosing around cromwell  he begs her to keep it under wraps    i know youre just a reporter  but you used to be a human being   she figures out whats really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search  where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction level comet  upon a topsecret meeting with president freeman  leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference  at which she gets to ask the first question  and everyone knows  if you get to ask the first question  baby youre a star  leoni ends up in the anchor chair  broadcasting every step of the comets collision course with earth  and im sure its comforting for her to know that  even though the worlds ending in a matter of months  shes a cable news personality  so there she is  narrating the sixastronaut mission to blow the comet up  such personalities as robert duvall  jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this draggedout process  but as anyone whos seen the commercials knows  the astronauts fail  they only end up breaking the comet into two pieces  which means even more destruction to the earth  yeah  thanks  nasa  thats when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who arent picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years  they even have animals  two by two  ready to climb into the cave  if the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed  deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie  instead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife  while people pack the highways out of town  the reasoning is  of course  that if a comet is going to strike  they might as well be out in some scenic rural location  and  amusingly  the highway is spotted with people in uhaul trucks  im sure its comforting to know that  even though the worlds ending in a matter of minutes  the uhaul people are doing the most business of their lives  
1	pulp fiction  quentin tarantinos anxiously awaited and superb followup to reservoir dogs  is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about  loved  and hated films of alltime  in all fairness  it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it  as if reservoir dogs wasnt perfect  tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction  a fastpaced  hard talking  roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way  every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor  to begin with  the two hit men  vincent vega  john travolta  and jules winnfield  samuel l  jackson   these two characters work together perfectly  and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect  travolta  in fact  is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role  if these two characters were not enough  theres the struggling boxer butch coolidge  bruce willis   the two smalltime criminals pumpkin  tim roth  and honey bunny  amanda plummer   the big man in charge marsellus wallace  ving rhames  and his attractive young wife mia  uma thurman   and the  problem solver  himself  the wolf  harvey keitel   these are just the major characters  smaller roles  but equally terrific  are handed to jimmie  quentin tarantino   a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business  lance  eric stoltz   the farout drug dealer  as well as maynard  duane whitaker  and zed  peter greene   two hillbillies who are the men  behind   no pun intended for those of you who have seen this  a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film  the film interweaves three stories that  at first  seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other  the film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and holdups  the two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop  unknowing of what lies ahead  after this  the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle  utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue  the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants  the two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss  marsellus wallace  after basically toying with the men  especially the unfortunate brett  frank whaley   vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase  this is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a  357   hand cannon   shooting at the two gangsters  he somehow completely misses them  leading jules to cite divine intervention  this is also the basis for more of the nowfamous tarantino dialogue  the film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades  butch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight  but when he does not  marsellus vows to find him  wherever he is  and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune  vincent  meanwhile  has the honor of taking marsellus wife  mia  out on a date while the big man is out of town  vincent  obviously  is rather nervous about this  especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage  after their date  which seems to rather smoothly  things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincents highpriced heroin  dubbed a  monster  by lance  each story continually progresses  and new and amazing events occur  eventually  the stories all meet each other in the end  with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant  which happens to contain both vincent and jules  pulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade  and possibly of alltime  along with its superb dialogue  action  writing  directing  and acting  this film will not only latch onto you  but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you  and with most fans of this movie  this is proved to be a rather easy task  although at times the graphic images  violence  and language may seem a bit overpowering  surely  quentin tarantinos fame was greatly escalated by this film  and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon

0	earth is a harsh  unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent  people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict  as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets  indian and pakistani  muslim  hindu  sikh  parsee  the story takes place in lahore  which was indian before partition  and pakistani afterward  regardless of what its citizens might call themselves  the action is seen through the eyes of lenny  maaia sethna   a young parsee girl  but it is really about her nanny  shanta  shanta has a small circle of male admirers  two of the men are suitors  hasan  rahul khanna   a hindu  and dil navaz  aamir khan   a muslim  the otherssikh  hindu  muslimare older  some are married  but all appreciate shanta  who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das    she also starred in deepa mehtas previous film  fire  the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water   in an early scene  the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny  political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears  one of the men remarks  jokingly  that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along  he is wrong  the men make barbed little comments to each other  spoken like jokes  but with an undercurrent of fanaticism  the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses  it is easy to perceive  in these squabbles  the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter  the group around shanta represents  in a sense  a united india  and shanta herself the ideal motherlandone which all love  which inspires hindu  muslim  and sikh to live peacably together  but the circle around shanta is sundered  as is the state  a sikh is persecuted  hides  then flees  another man is murdered  the group of friends will not meet again  the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction  a plate shattered on the floor  a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child  and  most brutally  when the tension escalates into violence  a man is held down  tied between two cars  and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles  it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully  the crux of earths plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz  his sisters are killed in brutal fashion  by hindus  because they are muslim  dil navaz seeks solace from shanta  and asks in desperation that she marry him  but she loves hasan  and tenderly refuses dil navazs offer  the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him  and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality  the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate  despite the things he later does  it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him  but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things  the conclusionthe consequence of dil navazs transformationis rather abrupt  the story earth tells does not end  it just stops  it is an appropriate finish  giving us closure would have imparted  at least on an aesthetic level  a sense of resolution  of satisfaction  but there was no resolution for india and pakistanthey have been at war  on a small or large scale  for decades  since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation  it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus  there is no healing to be had  no closure  on any level  despite the needless  tackedon ending  with voiceover narration from lenny as an adult  framing the story   earth is  in some ways  an unexceptional movie  it does not reinvent the wheel  following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas  but deepa mehtas directon is assured  and the issues she addresses run deep  earth does for india what movies like zhang yimous to live and tian zhuangzhuangs the blue kite did for china  they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history  such films strike me as inherently valuable  even when flawed  they may be biased or inaccurate  but they bear the weight of human hardship  and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other  more inventive films  often lack  it is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries  the events shown may have happened decades ago  but they still touch a nerve  the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year  in the near future  india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other  at the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen  after seeing earth  i have a much  much better understanding

0	a big surprise to me  the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off  but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues  john belushi  is such a dumb idea i really had no hope  they replaced him just fine  not with john goodman  he didnt do much of anything  but with the brilliant actor joe morton  who can really sing  the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant  whos ten  this was another of my fears for the film  but hes a really good dancer  and plays a mean harmonica  although he may have been dubbed   things that intellectually had bothered me before  like no mission from god  everyone being richer  it not being filmed in chicago  gave me no problems at all  im quite pleased that there were less car pileups  because they meant less music  and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing  theres a few early crashes  and then one huge pileup  but after that it all stops  its just the music  one of my problems with the first is that cab calloways song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him  but theres no problems with this  the music is all as good as ever  tons of great musicians showing up  with the exception of johnny lang  who cant sing  all the musicians do a great job  the only real problems i had was the special effects  these were superfluous and a waste of money  since the film isnt doing very well  they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel  which i want to see  the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide   http  www  geocities  comhollywoodacademy8034 remove no spam to reply    drive carefully but recklessly   mama  childs toy  the only excercise i take is walking behind the coffins of friends who took exercise   peter otoole 
0	my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance  or a movie that weve all seen a million times   two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins  this is exactly what happened in this movie  but fortunately  they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way  the movie starts with a quick  and i do mean quick  glance of two presidents russell kramer  jack lemmon  and matt douglas  james garner   william haney  dan aykroyd  and ted matthews  john heard  are the new president and vice president  there is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago  he finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead  this movie was exceptional for many reasons  one being that they found people  lemmon and garner  that have good chemisty together  they worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly  one being a ladies man and one being the old man  ill let you fiqure which is which   also  they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well  it seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman  except then he was a congressman   experience counts for a lot   
1	gothic murdermystery yarns are not a new conceit  in fact  theyve been around in books and on film for many  many years  without the proper handling  they come off as oldfashioned  bland  and outdated    the gift   directed by sam raimi  is a triedandtrue effort that surprises very little  and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings  to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front  to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond  its fairly obvious who the killer is  in fact  i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions  the film ultimately shouldnt work  but it does  thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances  the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other  annie wilson  cate blanchett  is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown  some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale  hilary swank   who is severely abused by her husband donnie  keanu reeves   and buddy cole  giovanni ribisi   an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares hes been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father  for annie  she does not give the readings merely for money  but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyones future  her late grandmother  rosemary harris  told her as a child that it was a gift she was given  and she should always remember that  when annies eldest son is involved in a fight at school  she meets the niceguy school principal  wayne collins  greg kinnear   whom she finds herself attracted to  but wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king  katie holmes   whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about  at a party with her best friend linda  kim dickens   annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan  gary cole   soon after  jessica has disappeared  leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her  and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale  and the pond behind his home    the gift  may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level  but the performances and tight direction from raimi  who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film  1999s  for love of the game   lift the picture up several notches  slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights  the disappearance of jessica at the 30minute mark divulges the movies true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut  at times frightening  horrormystery  at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett  1999s  the talented mr  ripley    who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a runofthemill protagonist into a very exact  downtoearth  realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her  blanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it  giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had  we follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing  both as a character and an actress  blanchett isnt the only bright performer  as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year  in her first role following her oscar win for 1999s  boys dont cry   hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie  who seeks guidance from annie  but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all  to leave the grossly abusive donnie  as donnie  keanu reeves  2000s  the watcher   makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie  so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all  for the oftencriticized reeves  whose acting abilities have never been the best  this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get  and it is also one of the better performances he has given  giovanni ribisi  2000s  the boiler room   is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend  and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad  in the small  but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king  katie holmes  2000s  wonder boys   has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn  her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before  and she is radiant in her few scenes  finally  kim dickens  2000s  hollow man   makes her usual strong impression as annies spicy best friend  linda  the other notable aspect of  the gift  is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene its almost suffocating  thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski  and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young  the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent  but one that is filled with dread  helped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson  which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast   the gift  is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills  and offers up a fair share of chills  too  it may not be groundbreakingly original  but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time  
0	these days  people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run  1970s nostalgia is already wearing off  and now  people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s  few years in the future  early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia  however  i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period  one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoons loaded weapon 1  that  in many ways  symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry  lack of originality and ideas  being made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series  this film pairs two l  a  policemen  jack colt  emilio estevez   burnout alcoholic cop on the edge  and wes luger  samuel l  jackson   bythebook policeman  days away from retirement  two of them  following the murder of lugers ex partner  must confront evil general mortars  william shatner   crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies  the authors of this films  whose director  gene quintano  worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy  lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects  and that reflects in the lack plot  characters  and  even original lines  the plot  or what goes for the plot in this movie  is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years  apart from lethal weapon series  this film  borrows  its female lead from basic instinct   the best gags  are  same as with many other similar movies  shown in the trailers  the rest simply doesnt work  only those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh  others would probably wince at the lameness of humour  some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while  but  at the end  spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort  the film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones  the authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel

0	an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis 1981 feature  an american werewolf in london  where the original had comedy  the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sitcoms  where the first installment had chills  this one has sequences that are inappropriately  unintentionally funny  in short  while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre  the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax  it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity   the film opens with a trio of daredevil americans  andy  tom everett scott   brad  vince vieluf   and chris  phil buckman   sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping  soon they have company in the person of serafine  julie delpy   who has decided to end it all  she jumps  but andy  with a bungee cord attached  goes after her  and manages to save her  at the price of a major headache   serafine disappears  but a smitten andy seeks her out  however  once he learns his wouldbe girlfriends dark secret  he wishes he hadnt  shes a werewolf  cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full  and  to make matters worse  he has suffered a nasty bite himself  actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie  she imbues serafine with spirit  spunk  and humanity  which gives us an emotional stake in the characters fate  this isnt necessarily a good thing  since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless  campy entertainment experience  delpys injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her  delpys previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowskis white and richard linklaters before sunrise  she was radiant  charismatic  and effective in both  given the nature and level of the material she has to work with here  she gets as close as possible to those adjectives  it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris  but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss  and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff  check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice  those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts  the rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy  which is to say  they give performances appropriate for the screenplay  tom everett scott  that thing you do  plays the lead like hes in a madefortv movie  it would be kind to call him bland  actors vince vieluf and phil buckman  as andys friends  are no more impressive  julie bowen  happy gilmore  is suitably fetching as werewolf meat  and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal  on the technical side  its all bad news  the computergenerated werewolves look painfully unreal  the creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits  repeated use is made of the  werewolf cam   an infrared wolfs pointofview approach thats interesting the first couple of times its employed  then becomes tedious  and the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the onscreen action theyre matched to  director anthony waller  who displayed a confident  edgy style in mute witness  stumbles with this material  never being able to make the comedy and horror elements gel  as a result  we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii  your sister is a werewolf    i will give waller credit for killing off a dog  though  something thats rarely seen in movies these days   an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a  bad movie  sort of way  but thats a dubious distinction  ultimately  its an unfortunate effort  for  while it isnt unbearable to sit through  it isnt a howl  either  
0	  idle hands  is distasteful  crass and derivative  if an original thought found its way into this horrorcomedy it would die of loneliness  plus  you have to question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of a movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teenagers the week after the tragedy in littleton  colo  the movie is insulting to horror film fans and teenagers  the plot  what little there is  deals with anton  devon sawa   a highschool slacker whos hand goes on a murderous rampage after becoming possessed  along the way the hand kills antons parents and his two best friends  the friends  also slackers  are so lazy that they return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them  that is the level of thiss atrocitys humor  the movie treats death as a joke    idle hands  is gruesome and morbid  the performances are stereotypical and cartoonish  i realize this is supposed to pass for comedy  but recent events have surpassed what is on the screen  it is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life  and i can only presume that the writers of  idle hands   terri hughes and ron milbauer  were trying to make some statement about todays young people and their values in a satiric vein  however  its hard to laugh at death these days  especially ones involving young people  with the real horrors of the world put before us on television  a stale pastry such as  idle hands  should be held from release for a few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths    idle hands  is bad  no matter the circumstances in the world outside  but the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings  the time is not right for this type of movie  and as far as  idle hands  goes  the time may never be right  this is a movie that shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema  
0	cradle will rock is the latest effort from directoractor tim robbins  while he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995  dead man walking   he gets a little overconfident and sloppy here  the story is confusing  and filled with many subplots  so ill try my best and explain it as simply as possible  the film is based on a  mostly  true story about a federal theater in the 1930s  that produced a play  the cradle will rock  that apparently was offensive to some  so the government shuts it down  its during the time of the depression  and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs  or are poor  between this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots  about those who work in theater  or those associated  also along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience  tim robbins just keeps piling on political views  and characters  that we just give up on the film  or in some cases walk out  for robbins it may be a nice achievement  but to me it seemed more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue  and fancy outfits  i thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast  unfortunately are all uninteresting  except for a few  let me recap what each important character does  so please bear with me  its the least you can do  especially if you were considering seeing this   ill begin with those involved with the play  theres orson welles  angus macfadyen  who of course is the director of the play  the producer john houseman  cary elwes   marc blitzstein  hank azaria  the writer of the play  emily watson  a woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock  outside the play theres the  ventriloquist  bill murray  who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk  joan cusack   another subplot involving a painter diego rivera  ruben blades  whos unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage  john cusack   theres a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories  susan sarandon  philip baker hall too name a few  but those that i mentioned  were the most significant to the story  anyway  most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted  except for emily watson  who does another great job  and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack  who always delivers through thick and thin  now although most of the film was weak to say the least  there were some nice moments and some involving subjects  but all this is overblown  sure the free speech segment was a nice feature  but not when it becomes repetitive  the whole film is like this  and its basically nothing but a headache  on the brighter side  tim robbins direction was masterful  his camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas andersons latest magnolia  only smoother in my opinion  but even that cant make a movie that much better  although it has its moments  not many of them  but theyre there   cradle will rock stays true to its title  because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over  
0	robert redfords a river runs through it is not a film i watch often  it is a masterpiece  one of the better films of recent years  until 1994  it was my second favorite film of all time  the acting and direction is topnotch  never sappy  always touching  a friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because  i was afraid it would just be really politically correct  and tick me off   all i could do was tell him to go in unbiased  and enjoy  it is one of the few movies that has completely reduced me to tears  but certain memories should not often be rereleased  in the last few shots  you have to cry  upon my first viewing i left bawling  it is not flawless  but it is so very good  that you cant help but be effected  the opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental  watching these shots of people who have been dead so long  gives you a feeling of perspective and history observation that you will find in very few other films  martin scorsese once described the movies as a dream state  like taking dope  and immersing yourself in an alternative world  that is what a river runs through it does  it exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self  both times ive seen it  its been hard  again to quote scorsese  waking up  but the dream is lovely  
0	woody allen is one of the most successful artistdirectors in hollywood  but he is becoming less and less reliable as a filmmaker  in his early years of filmmaking he mastered the simple comedy  from there he went into a second phase and took risks experimenting with different approaches and styles  some of these work better than others  zelig and crimes and misdemeanors are the work of a creative and intelligent artist  deconstructing harry goes to the other extreme and is a bizarre experiment demanding more of the viewer than it gives back  harry block  allen  has in his life only two drives  he wants to have sex with as many women as possible and when he makes a mess of his life and those of his lovers he wants to retreat into his writing  the story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told with a number of often clumsy stylistic experiments  perhaps the most irritating device is to express the disjointedness of harrys life by editing harrys scenes putting in cuts in the middle as if to show missing time with something edited out  as a writer  harry puts his friends into his books in the thinnest of disguises  the film dramatizes incidents from these supposed books and cuts between his real story line and fragments from harrys books with different actors playing the real and fictional people in harrys life  these fragments are frustrating in their lack of completion  but even more frustrating is the bringing of the characters out of the fragments into scenes with the real characters  it is up to the viewer to keep track not just who is fictional and who is real but also to keep straight who is the fictional doppelganger of which real person  if that sounds complicated  it is  then as another device in one of the stories  an actor seems to have the peculiar property that he has gone out of focus and can only be seen in blurry image  harry sees this as a metaphor for his own condition and himself goes blurry for a short time  as if these touches did not create sufficient confusion  the story is told out of chronological order  if allen were giving the audience a story that was worth decoding  any and all of these stylistic touches could be excusable  but allen puts the audience through all of this to give us a portrait of harry block who is a selfish manipulator who is not worth the effort to understand  deconstructing harry is set at a time when harrys old college  the one that expelled him when he attended it  wants now to honor him for a lifetime of writing achievement  harry is searching among his friends to find one who will go with him  just why someone who is so unwilling to commit to a relationship with anyone suddenly needs the support of someone else is unclear  harry tries his current girl friend fay  elizabeth shue  only to find that she is about to marry harrys old friend larry  billy crystal   block would like his son hilly  eric lloyd  to accompany him  but hillys mother  previously first harrys psychiatrist and more recently his wife  refuses to let her son see his father  another friend richard  bob balaban  would go but has health problems  harry also considers bringing a prostitute cookie  hazel goodman   it is interesting that allen should introduce another likable prostitute so soon after mighty aphrodite  but cookie is considerably differentblack and a lot brighter than mira sorvinos character in the previous film  while the comedy sequences are never complete  a few are elaborate and some quite funny  the centerpiece of the film is a journey into hell with allen playing a sort of orpheus rescuing fay from the clutches of the devil  who looks a lot like larry  that story also is left uncompleted  perhaps to show harrys unwillingness to commit even to telling a story  the linchpin that was needed to tie together the stylistic quirks of this film was a central character who changes and who gives us something about which to care  that character is patently not the one allen creates in harry block and not the characters around harry as seen through his acerbic eyes  allen can do much better than deconstructing harry  i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale  
0	steven spielbergs  amistad   which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship  then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who  owned  them  is concerned with several different aspects of this story  first  the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery  second  it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case  including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams  anthony hopkins   last  and most importantly  it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade    amistad  succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements  i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another  antislavery  movie  having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery  i doubted that there was much i didnt already know about it  fortunately  i turned out to be wrong  for one thing  spielbergs camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders operations in africa  so  amistad  was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning  and some of the images here are  in fact  much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery  one scene in the middle  in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their  excess  slaves by throwing them overboard to drown  has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year  spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would  and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc17 rating  the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians  such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain  whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time  exposing politicians as narrowminded  opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff  of course  but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation  the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time  such that john quincy adams  and probably other politicians like him   who clearly disapproved of the practice  was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court  the biggest success of  amistad  is probably the characterization of cinque  djimon hounsou   who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin  matthew mcconaughey   the lawyer who represents them in court  through cinque  we are given a window into the native culture  as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member  or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ  cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that  again  contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles    what kind of country is this  where laws almost work   he asks baldwin in bewilderment  when he learns that the case must be retried before the supreme court  spielbergs direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times  such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinques angry outburst in the court room  still  there isnt enough of this for it to be a serious problem  the main flaw in this film  which prevents it from earning four stars  is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni cant quite handle all of these issues at the same time  so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie  this summers contact  for example  dealt with several issues at once  but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and  most importantly  all of them were resolved at once    amistad  tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams  but it somehow feels a little forced  and in any case the speech itself  which lasts almost fifteen minutes  wears out its welcome about halfway through  perhaps the best way to describe it is this   amistad  is three four star films edited into one  almost every individual scene works  but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence  and thus is less than the sum of its parts  however  i cant honestly say how it could have been done differently  and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film  and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery
